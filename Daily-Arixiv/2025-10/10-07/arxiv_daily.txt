Title: AlphaApollo: Orchestrating Foundation Models and Professional Tools into
  a Self-Evolving System for Deep Agentic Reasoning

  We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to
address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited
model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo
orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate,
verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical
and symbolic libraries) and (ii) a retrieval tool (task-relevant external
information) to execute exact calculations and ground decisions. The system
further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state
map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative
refinement. In evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 across multiple models,
AlphaApollo delivers consistent gains: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32
for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and +8.91% Average@32 with +26.67% Pass@32 for
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Tool-use analysis shows that more than 80% of tool
calls are successfully executed, with consistent outperformance of non-tool
baselines, thereby lifting the capability ceiling of FMs. More empirical
results and implementation details will be updated at

  Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward
problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with
large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of
distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,
consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity
Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem
setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD
generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal
required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution
structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that
of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description
Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;
reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and
compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases
solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like
under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over
solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with
recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:
incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,
rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing
inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to
reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic
forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved
by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require
architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate
computation with respect to complexity.

Title: BuilderBench -- A benchmark for generalist agents

\\
  Today's AI models learn primarily through mimicry and sharpening, so it is
not surprising that they struggle to solve problems beyond the limits set by
existing data. To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for
exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning
mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major
open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to
accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended
exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure
using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated
simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and
$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully
curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon
planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles
about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation,
agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving
these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected
in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and
piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge
the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training
wheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single
target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file
implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for
researchers.

Title: Requirements for Game-Based Learning Design Framework for Information
  System Integration in the Context of Post-Merger Integration
Authors: Ksenija Lace, Marite Kirikova
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Post-merger integration states unique challenges for professionals
responsible for information system integration aimed on alignment and
combination diverse system architectures of merging organizations. Although the
theoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the
business level, there is a significant gap in training for information system
integration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support
method for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for
informed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system
integration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical
application was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This
paper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by
transforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The
study analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation
models, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential
requirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information
system integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in
two components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience.
The paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed
framework through iterative design and real-world validation.

Title: Belief-Calibrated Multi-Agent Consensus Seeking for Complex NLP Tasks
Authors: Wentao Deng, Jiahuan Pei, Zhiwei Xu, Zhaochun Ren, Zhumin Chen,
  Pengjie Ren
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: This paper has been accepted by NeurIPS 2025
\\
  A multi-agent system (MAS) enhances its capacity to solve complex natural
language processing (NLP) tasks through collaboration among multiple agents,
where consensus-seeking serves as a fundamental mechanism. However, existing
consensus-seeking approaches typically rely on voting mechanisms to judge
consensus, overlooking contradictions in system-internal beliefs that
destabilize the consensus. Moreover, these methods often involve agents
updating their results through indiscriminate collaboration with every other
agent. Such uniform interaction fails to identify the optimal collaborators for
each agent, hindering the emergence of a stable consensus. To address these
challenges, we provide a theoretical framework for selecting optimal
collaborators that maximize consensus stability. Based on the theorems, we
propose the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to facilitate
stable consensus via selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the
consensus judgment by system-internal beliefs. Experimental results on the MATH
and MMLU benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCCS framework
outperforms the best existing results by 2.23% and 3.95% of accuracy on
challenging tasks, respectively. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/dengwentao99/BCCS.

Title: Off-Trajectory Reasoning: Can LLMs Collaborate on Reasoning Trajectory?
Authors: Aochong Oliver Li, Tanya Goyal
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding
strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising
direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking
within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and
exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the
usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this
off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can
standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory
behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the
off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can
backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and
Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from
stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and
reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often
more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively
leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent
capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control
studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these
behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data
selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training
natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal
recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled
students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together,
this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in
shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf
reasoning LLMs.

Title: Flavonoid Fusion: Creating a Knowledge Graph to Unveil the Interplay
  Between Food and Health
Authors: Aryan Singh Dalal, Yinglun Zhang, Duru Do\u{g}an, Atalay Mert \.Ileri,
  and Hande K\"u\c{c}\"uk McGinty
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The focus on "food as medicine" is gaining traction in the field of health
and several studies conducted in the past few years discussed this aspect of
food in the literature. However, very little research has been done on
representing the relationship between food and health in a standardized,
machine-readable format using a semantic web that can help us leverage this
knowledge effectively. To address this gap, this study aims to create a
knowledge graph to link food and health through the knowledge graph's ability
to combine information from various platforms focusing on flavonoid contents of
food found in the USDA databases and cancer connections found in the
literature. We looked closely at these relationships using KNARM methodology
and represented them in machine-operable format. The proposed knowledge graph
serves as an example for researchers, enabling them to explore the complex
interplay between dietary choices and disease management. Future work for this
study involves expanding the scope of the knowledge graph by capturing nuances,
adding more related data, and performing inferences on the acquired knowledge
to uncover hidden relationships.

Title: PuzzlePlex: Benchmarking Foundation Models on Reasoning and Planning
  with Puzzles
Authors: Yitao Long, Yuru Jiang, Hongjun Liu, Yilun Zhao, Jingchen Sun, Yiqiu
  Shen, Chen Zhao, Arman Cohan, Dennis Shasha
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  This work investigates the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation
models and their scalability in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce
PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse
set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including
deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as
single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a
comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate
more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we
implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this
benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct
an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings:
instruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
their scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others
in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater
challenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative. PuzzlePlex enables
targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and
generalization for foundation models.

Title: Beneficial Reasoning Behaviors in Agentic Search and Effective
  Post-training to Obtain Them
Authors: Jiahe Jin, Abhijay Paladugu, Chenyan Xiong
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex
user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching,
and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces
unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting
with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a
reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior
patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic
search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:
Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error
Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior
Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic
search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into
the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by
standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,
WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in
Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models
with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the
SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical
factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on
trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to
better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our
analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning
behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and
entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a
strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.

Title: Auto-Prompt Ensemble for LLM Judge
Authors: Jiajie Li, Huayi Zhang, Peng Lin, Jinjun Xiong, Wei Xu
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  We present a novel framework that improves the reliability of LLM judges by
selectively augmenting LLM with auxiliary evaluation dimensions. Existing LLM
judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize
the implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge,
we propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that
automatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE
incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the
judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence
estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse
standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward
Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a
principled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge
the evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

Title: WebDART: Dynamic Decomposition and Re-planning for Complex Web Tasks
Authors: Jingbo Yang, Bairu Hou, Wei Wei, Shiyu Chang, Yujia Bao
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming competent at straightforward
web tasks, such as opening an item page or submitting a form, but still
struggle with objectives that require long horizon navigation, large scale
information extraction, and reasoning under constraints. We present WebDART, a
general framework that enables a single LLM to handle such complex chores.
WebDART (i) dynamically decomposes each objective into three focused subtasks:
navigation, information extraction, and execution, so the model concentrates on
one skill at a time, and (ii) continuously replans the decomposition as new
webpages are revealed, taking advantage of newly discovered filters or
shortcuts and avoiding redundant exploration. Evaluated on WebChoreArena,
WebDART lifts success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA
agents, while matching their performance on the easier WebArena suite and
completing tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.

\\
  Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in
queries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role
in various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the
representation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar
examples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the
reasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but
overlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making
in fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL
relies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional
prototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are
critical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional
discrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To
address this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL), which introduces
emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve
query representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion
strategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further
optimizing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments show that EICL
significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.

  We introduce an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that implements a
continuous data flywheel for iteratively improving an LLM-based customer
support system. Unlike standard offline approaches that rely on batch
annotations, AITL integrates four key types of annotations directly into live
customer operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and
rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing
knowledge. These feedback signals seamlessly feed back into models' updates,
reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks. Our production pilot involving
US-based customer support agents demonstrated significant improvements in
retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality
(+8.4% helpfulness) and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). These results underscore
the effectiveness of embedding human feedback loops directly into operational
workflows to continuously refine LLM-based customer support system.

Title: Inefficiencies of Meta Agents for Agent Design
Authors: Batu El, Mert Yuksekgonul, James Zou
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using
meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In
this paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.
First, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that
simply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous
works, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the
performance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the
meta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a
single agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral
diversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess
when automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few
cases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying
the agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over
15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not
justify the design cost, regardless of scale.

Title: MultiCNKG: Integrating Cognitive Neuroscience, Gene, and Disease
  Knowledge Graphs Using Large Language Models
Authors: Ali Sarabadani, Kheirolah Rahsepar Fard
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the integration
of knowledge graphs (KGs) in biomedical and cognitive sciences, overcoming
limitations in traditional machine learning methods for capturing intricate
semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes. We introduce
MultiCNKG, an innovative framework that merges three key knowledge sources: the
Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph (CNKG) with 2.9K nodes and 4.3K edges
across 9 node types and 20 edge types; Gene Ontology (GO) featuring 43K nodes
and 75K edges in 3 node types and 4 edge types; and Disease Ontology (DO)
comprising 11.2K nodes and 8.8K edges with 1 node type and 2 edge types.
Leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we conduct entity alignment, semantic similarity
computation, and graph augmentation to create a cohesive KG that interconnects
genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions. The
resulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes,
Diseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes,
Associated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular
to behavioral domains. Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%),
recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty
detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and
coherence. Link prediction evaluations with models like TransE (MR: 391, MRR:
0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) show competitive performance against
benchmarks like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. This KG advances applications in
personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis
formulation in cognitive neuroscience.

Title: Verifying Memoryless Sequential Decision-making of Large Language Models
Authors: Dennis Gross, Helge Spieker, Arnaud Gotlieb
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  We introduce a tool for rigorous and automated verification of large language
model (LLM)- based policies in memoryless sequential decision-making tasks.
Given a Markov decision process (MDP) representing the sequential
decision-making task, an LLM policy, and a safety requirement expressed as a
PCTL formula, our approach incrementally constructs only the reachable portion
of the MDP guided by the LLM's chosen actions. Each state is encoded as a
natural language prompt, the LLM's response is parsed into an action, and
reachable successor states by the policy are expanded. The resulting formal
model is checked with Storm to determine whether the policy satisfies the
specified safety property. In experiments on standard grid world benchmarks, we
show that open source LLMs accessed via Ollama can be verified when
deterministically seeded, but generally underperform deep reinforcement
learning baselines. Our tool natively integrates with Ollama and supports
PRISM-specified tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking in user-specified
sequential decision-making tasks and laying a practical foundation for formally
verifying increasingly capable LLMs.

Title: Evolving and Executing Research Plans via Double-Loop Multi-Agent
  Collaboration
Authors: Zhi Zhang, Yan Liu, Zhejing Hu, Gong Chen, Sheng-hua Zhong, Jiannong
  Cao
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental
challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound,
and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To
address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent
(DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader
loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans.
It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and
integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research
proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop,
composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the
best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via
pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is
well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments
on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research
papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation,
significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the
critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution
ensuring soundness.

language models to training an end-to-end formalizer model from scratch,
achieving remarkable advancements. However, existing formalizer still struggles
to consistently generate valid statements that meet syntactic validity and
semantic consistency. To address this issue, we propose the Autoformalizer with
Tool Feedback (ATF), a novel approach that incorporates syntactic and
consistency information as tools into the formalization process. By integrating
Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and employing a multi-LLMs-as-judge
approach for consistency validation, the model is able to adaptively refine
generated statements according to the tool feedback, enhancing both syntactic
validity and semantic consistency. The training of ATF involves a cold-start
phase on synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase to improve
formalization capabilities, and Direct Preference Optimization to alleviate
ineffective revisions. Experimental results show that ATF markedly outperforms
a range of baseline formalizer models, with its superior performance further
validated by human evaluations. Subsequent analysis reveals that ATF
demonstrates excellent inference scaling properties. Moreover, we open-source
Numina-ATF, a dataset containing 750K synthetic formal statements to facilitate
advancements in autoformalization and ATP research.

Title: TGPR: Tree-Guided Policy Refinement for Robust Self-Debugging of LLMs
Authors: Daria Ozerova, Ekaterina Trofimova
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Iterative refinement has been a promising paradigm to enable large language
models (LLMs) to resolve difficult reasoning and problem-solving tasks. One of
the key challenges, however, is how to effectively search through the enormous
search space of possible refinements. Existing methods typically fall back on
predefined heuristics, which are troubled by the exploration-exploitation
dilemma and cannot adapt based on past refinement outcomes. We introduce
Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), a novel framework that combines GRPO with
a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search. TGPR explores both failed and successful
refinement paths actively, with denser training trajectories and more adaptive
policies. On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, our method achieves up to
+4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to
+12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to
a competitive GRPO baseline. Apart from debugging code, TGPR focuses on a
principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search
methods, offering a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and
stateful reasoning in LLMs.

Title: LLM-Assisted Modeling of Semantic Web-Enabled Multi-Agents Systems with
  AJAN
Authors: Hacane Hechehouche, Andre Antakli, Matthias Klusch
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  There are many established semantic Web standards for implementing
multi-agent driven applications. The AJAN framework allows to engineer
multi-agent systems based on these standards. In particular, agent knowledge is
represented in RDF/RDFS and OWL, while agent behavior models are defined with
Behavior Trees and SPARQL to access and manipulate this knowledge. However, the
appropriate definition of RDF/RDFS and SPARQL-based agent behaviors still
remains a major hurdle not only for agent modelers in practice. For example,
dealing with URIs is very error-prone regarding typos and dealing with complex
SPARQL queries in large-scale environments requires a high learning curve. In
this paper, we present an integrated development environment to overcome such
hurdles of modeling AJAN agents and at the same time to extend the user
community for AJAN by the possibility to leverage Large Language Models for
agent engineering.

Title: Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis in LLM Reasoning
  Traces
Authors: Minju Gwak, Guijin Son, Jaehyung Kim
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective
communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit
this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces,
asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end,
we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce
two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores.
Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that
step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also
yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces
with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by
10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals
that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,
while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results
demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform
alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results
highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and
selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.

Title: Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization: Synergizing Reasoning and Adaptive
  Tool Use with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Wenxun Wu, Yuanyang Li, Guhan Chen, Linyue Wang, Hongyang Chen
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have popularized test-time
scaling, where models generate additional reasoning tokens before producing
final answers. These approaches have demonstrated significant performance
improvements on benchmarks involving mathematical reasoning. However, language
models relying solely on direct inference still struggle with tasks demanding
up-to-date knowledge or computational tools such as calculators and code
interpreters for complex arithmetic operations. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel reinforcement
learning framework that systematically integrates multi-hop reasoning with
adaptive tool-calling capabilities. Our approach employs a modified version of
Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), a recently developed RL paradigm,
which we adapt specifically for tool invocation scenarios, enabling models to
dynamically interleave complex reasoning with on-demand tool usage (including
search APIs and Python interpreters).
  To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and
TAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based
reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Our experiments on
Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
with both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring
external knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable
parameters. Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than
baseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking.
These results highlight the significant potential of combining advanced
reasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive
and computationally demanding tasks.

Title: Prompt Optimization Across Multiple Agents for Representing Diverse
  Human Populations
Authors: Manh Hung Nguyen, Sebastian Tschiatschek, Adish Singla
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The difficulty and expense of obtaining large-scale human responses make
Large Language Models (LLMs) an attractive alternative and a promising proxy
for human behavior. However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce
homogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human
perspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity
with a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of
agents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population.
Each agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set
of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The
central challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents
from the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection
problem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop
methods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and
performance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational
domains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively
represent human populations compared to baselines. Moreover, behavioral
analyses on new tasks show that these agents reproduce the behavior patterns
and perspectives of the students and annotators they are designed to represent.

\\
  Possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models are a major
variant of answer set programming (ASP). While its semantics (possibilistic
stable models) and properties have been well investigated, the problem of
inductive reasoning has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an
approach to extracting poss-programs from a background program and examples
(parts of intended possibilistic stable models). To this end, the notion of
induction tasks is first formally defined, its properties are investigated and
two algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin for computing induction solutions are
presented. An implementation of ilpsmmin is also provided and experimental
results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype
outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from
stable models on the datasets that are randomly generated.

  Designing high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is a
complex task that requires both intuition and deep domain knowledge. Large
language model (LLM)-based code generation has recently shown promise across
many domains, but it still falls short of producing heuristics that rival those
crafted by human experts. In this paper, we propose VRPAgent, a framework that
integrates LLM-generated components into a metaheuristic and refines them
through a novel genetic search. By using the LLM to generate problem-specific
operators, embedded within a generic metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent keeps
tasks manageable, guarantees correctness, and still enables the discovery of
novel and powerful strategies. Across multiple problems, including the
capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, and the prize-collecting VRP, our
method discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and
recent learning-based approaches while requiring only a single CPU core. To our
knowledge, \VRPAgent is the first LLM-based paradigm to advance the
state-of-the-art in VRPs, highlighting a promising future for automated
heuristics discovery.

Title: The Cognitive Bandwidth Bottleneck: Shifting Long-Horizon Agent from
  Planning with Actions to Planning with Schemas
Authors: Baixuan Xu, Tianshi Zheng, Zhaowei Wang, Hong Ting Tsang, Weiqi Wang,
  Tianqing Fang, Yangqiu Song
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: 22 pages
\\
  Enabling LLMs to effectively operate long-horizon task which requires
long-term planning and multiple interactions is essential for open-world
autonomy. Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable
action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation
choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial
exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As
environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation
for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the
effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is
conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its
effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas
(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ]
to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable
scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human
cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format
restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual
framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action
representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection
point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve
as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct
controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point
interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts
the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it
leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide
an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable
autonomy.

  Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be
avoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to
open-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological
organisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical
world with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the
conditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,
adaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions
for physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin
Heidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and
being-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal
states due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these
conditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining
integrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an
intrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing
inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,
we examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,
empowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to
meet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to
maintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement
learning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven
embodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate
the capacities for open-endedness and care.ov

Title: Integrating Domain Knowledge into Process Discovery Using Large Language
  Models
Authors: Ali Norouzifar, Humam Kourani, Marcus Dees, Wil van der Aalst
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: This paper is currently under review for publication in a journal
\\
  Process discovery aims to derive process models from event logs, providing
insights into operational behavior and forming a foundation for conformance
checking and process improvement. However, models derived solely from event
data may not accurately reflect the real process, as event logs are often
incomplete or affected by noise, and domain knowledge, an important
complementary resource, is typically disregarded. As a result, the discovered
models may lack reliability for downstream tasks. We propose an interactive
framework that incorporates domain knowledge, expressed in natural language,
into the process discovery pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
approach leverages LLMs to extract declarative rules from textual descriptions
provided by domain experts. These rules are used to guide the IMr discovery
algorithm, which recursively constructs process models by combining insights
from both the event log and the extracted rules, helping to avoid problematic
process structures that contradict domain knowledge. The framework coordinates
interactions among the LLM, domain experts, and a set of backend services. We
present a fully implemented tool that supports this workflow and conduct an
extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies. Our
empirical study includes a case study based on a real-life event log with the
involvement of domain experts, who assessed the usability and effectiveness of
the framework.

  Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law
discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing
benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,
forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance
to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function
fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering
embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising
324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design
mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic
alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are
scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we
elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model
discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems
to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but
fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades
precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme
sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of
tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by
inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to
satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,
generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core
challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic
testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and
guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine
scientific discovery.

Title: Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Path Finding with Lexicographic Cost
  Preferences
Authors: Pulkit Rustagi, Kyle Hollins Wray and Sandhya Saisubramanian
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA
Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Many real-world scenarios require multiple agents to coordinate in shared
environments, while balancing trade-offs between multiple, potentially
competing objectives. Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding
(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto
frontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even
when the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of
objectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along
with an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that
directly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference
over objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with
conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling
efficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights
into optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes
optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far
beyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard and
randomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates against
state-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.

  Industrial question-answering (QA) systems require higher safety and
reliability than general-purpose dialogue models, as errors in high-risk
scenarios such as equipment fault diagnosis can have severe consequences.
Although multi-agent large language models enhance reasoning depth, they suffer
from uncontrolled iterations and unverifiable outputs, and conventional
distillation methods struggle to transfer collaborative reasoning capabilities
to lightweight, deployable student models. To address these challenges, we
propose Knowledge Graph-guided Multi-Agent System Distillation (KG-MASD). Our
approach formulates distillation as a Markov Decision Process and incorporates
a knowledge graph as a verifiable structured prior to enrich state
representation and ensure convergence. By integrating collaborative reasoning
with knowledge grounding, KG-MASD generates high-confidence instruction-tuning
data and jointly distills reasoning depth and verifiability into compact
student models suitable for edge deployment. Experiments on an industrial QA
dataset show that KG-MASD improves accuracy by 2.4 per cent to 20.1 per cent
over baselines and significantly enhances reliability, enabling trustworthy AI
deployment in safety-critical industrial scenarios. Code and data are available

  Open-ended survey responses provide valuable insights in marketing research,
but low-quality responses not only burden researchers with manual filtering but
also risk leading to misleading conclusions, underscoring the need for
effective evaluation. Existing automatic evaluation methods target
LLM-generated text and inadequately assess human-written responses with their
distinct characteristics. To address such characteristics, we propose a
two-stage evaluation framework specifically designed for human survey
responses. First, gibberish filtering removes nonsensical responses. Then,
three dimensions-effort, relevance, and completeness-are evaluated using LLM
capabilities, grounded in empirical analysis of real-world survey data.
Validation on English and Korean datasets shows that our framework not only
outperforms existing metrics but also demonstrates high practical applicability
for real-world applications such as response quality prediction and response
rejection, showing strong correlations with expert assessment.

  Referring Expression Comprehension and Segmentation are critical tasks for
assessing the integration of language understanding and image comprehension,
serving as benchmarks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)

Referring, which enhances model reasoning across modalities through a

in each step it identifies relationships and ensures consistent reference
alignment, thereby improving accuracy in complex query scenarios. We
restructure the training data to enforce a new output form, providing new
annotations for existing datasets and compiling an evaluation benchmark from
existing resources. This benchmark is designed explicitly for complex referring
cases. We also integrate detection and segmentation capabilities into a unified
MLLM framework, training it with a novel adaptive weighted loss to optimize
performance. Experimental results on our curated benchmark and RefCOCO/+/g
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with a notable increase of 2.5%+

Title: Evaluating Embedding Frameworks for Scientific Domain

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Finding an optimal word representation algorithm is particularly important in
terms of domain specific data, as the same word can have different meanings and
hence, different representations depending on the domain and context. While
Generative AI and transformer architecture does a great job at generating
contextualized embeddings for any given work, they are quite time and compute
extensive, especially if we were to pre-train such a model from scratch. In
this work, we focus on the scientific domain and finding the optimal word
representation algorithm along with the tokenization method that could be used
to represent words in the scientific domain. The goal of this research is two
fold: 1) finding the optimal word representation and tokenization methods that
can be used in downstream scientific domain NLP tasks, and 2) building a
comprehensive evaluation suite that could be used to evaluate various word
representation and tokenization algorithms (even as new ones are introduced) in
the scientific domain. To this end, we build an evaluation suite consisting of
several downstream tasks and relevant datasets for each task. Furthermore, we
use the constructed evaluation suite to test various word representation and
tokenization algorithms.

(MMLoSo) Language Challenge addresses one of India's most pressing linguistic
gaps: the lack of resources for its diverse low-resource languages (LRLs). In
this study, we investigate whether enforcing cross-lingual similarity in
specific internal layers of a decoder-only multilingual large language model
(LLM) can improve translation quality from LRL to high-resource language (HRL).
Specifically, we combine Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity metric
that encourages representations of different languages to align, with REPINA, a
regularization method that constrains parameter updates to remain close to the
pretrained model, into a joint method we call TRepLiNa. In this research
project, we experiment with zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings using
Aya-23 8B with QLoRA across MMLoSo shared task language pairs (Mundari,
Santali, Bhili) with Hindi/English pivots. Our results show that aligning
mid-level layers using TRepLiNa (CKA+REPINA) is a low-cost, practical approach
to improving LRL translation, especially in data-scarce settings.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain wider adoption, ensuring their reliable
handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) across diverse regulatory
contexts has become essential. This work introduces a scalable multilingual
data curation framework designed for high-quality PII annotation across 13
underrepresented locales, covering approximately 336 locale-specific PII types.
Our phased, human-in-the-loop annotation methodology combines linguistic
expertise with rigorous quality assurance, leading to substantial improvements
in recall and false positive rates from pilot, training, and production phases.
By leveraging inter-annotator agreement metrics and root-cause analysis, the
framework systematically uncovers and resolves annotation inconsistencies,
resulting in high-fidelity datasets suitable for supervised LLM fine-tuning.
Beyond reporting empirical gains, we highlight common annotator challenges in
multilingual PII labeling and demonstrate how iterative, analytics-driven
pipelines can enhance both annotation quality and downstream model reliability.

Title: Prakriti200: A Questionnaire-Based Dataset of 200 Ayurvedic Prakriti
  Assessments
Authors: Aryan Kumar Singh and Janvi Singh
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures
\\
  This dataset provides responses to a standardized, bilingual (English-Hindi)
Prakriti Assessment Questionnaire designed to evaluate the physical,
physiological, and psychological characteristics of individuals according to
classical Ayurvedic principles. The questionnaire consists of 24
multiple-choice items covering body features, appetite, sleep patterns, energy
levels, and temperament. It was developed following AYUSH/CCRAS guidelines to
ensure comprehensive and accurate data collection. All questions are mandatory
and neutrally phrased to minimize bias, and dosha labels (Vata, Pitta, Kapha)
are hidden from participants. Data were collected via a Google Forms
deployment, enabling automated scoring of responses to map individual traits to
dosha-specific scores. The resulting dataset provides a structured platform for
research in computational intelligence, Ayurvedic studies, and personalized
health analytics, supporting analysis of trait distributions, correlations, and
predictive modeling. It can also serve as a reference for future Prakriti-based
studies and the development of intelligent health applications.

\\
  Electronic health records (EHRs) contain extensive unstructured clinical data
that can overwhelm emergency physicians trying to identify critical
information. We present a two-stage summarization system that runs entirely on
embedded devices, enabling offline clinical summarization while preserving
patient privacy. In our approach, a dual-device architecture first retrieves
relevant patient record sections using the Jetson Nano-R (Retrieve), then
generates a structured summary on another Jetson Nano-S (Summarize),
communicating via a lightweight socket link. The summarization output is
two-fold: (1) a fixed-format list of critical findings, and (2) a
context-specific narrative focused on the clinician's query. The retrieval
stage uses locally stored EHRs, splits long notes into semantically coherent
sections, and searches for the most relevant sections per query. The generation
stage uses a locally hosted small language model (SLM) to produce the summary
from the retrieved text, operating within the constraints of two NVIDIA Jetson
devices. We first benchmarked six open-source SLMs under 7B parameters to
identify viable models. We incorporated an LLM-as-Judge evaluation mechanism to
assess summary quality in terms of factual accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
Preliminary results on MIMIC-IV and de-identified real EHRs demonstrate that
our fully offline system can effectively produce useful summaries in under 30
seconds.

Title: A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination in Large Language Models:
  Causes, Detection, and Mitigation
Authors: Aisha Alansari and Hamzah Luqman
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, their
impressive fluency often comes at the cost of producing false or fabricated
information, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Hallucination refers to the
generation of content by an LLM that is fluent and syntactically correct but
factually inaccurate or unsupported by external evidence. Hallucinations
undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs, especially in domains
requiring factual accuracy. This survey provides a comprehensive review of
research on hallucination in LLMs, with a focus on causes, detection, and
mitigation. We first present a taxonomy of hallucination types and analyze
their root causes across the entire LLM development lifecycle, from data
collection and architecture design to inference. We further examine how
hallucinations emerge in key natural language generation tasks. Building on
this foundation, we introduce a structured taxonomy of detection approaches and
another taxonomy of mitigation strategies. We also analyze the strengths and
limitations of current detection and mitigation approaches and review existing
evaluation benchmarks and metrics used to quantify LLMs hallucinations.
Finally, we outline key open challenges and promising directions for future
research, providing a foundation for the development of more truthful and
trustworthy LLMs.

Title: Language models for longitudinal analysis of abusive content in
  Billboard Music Charts
Authors: Rohitash Chandra, Yathin Suresh, Divyansh Raj Sinha, Sanchit Jindal
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  There is no doubt that there has been a drastic increase in abusive and
sexually explicit content in music, particularly in Billboard Music Charts.
However, there is a lack of studies that validate the trend for effective
policy development, as such content has harmful behavioural changes in children
and youths. In this study, we utilise deep learning methods to analyse songs
(lyrics) from Billboard Charts of the United States in the last seven decades.
We provide a longitudinal study using deep learning and language models and
review the evolution of content using sentiment analysis and abuse detection,
including sexually explicit content. Our results show a significant rise in
explicit content in popular music from 1990 onwards. Furthermore, we find an
increasing prevalence of songs with lyrics containing profane, sexually
explicit, and otherwise inappropriate language. The longitudinal analysis of
the ability of language models to capture nuanced patterns in lyrical content,
reflecting shifts in societal norms and language use over time.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  In this study, we reproduced the work done in the paper "XRec: Large Language
Models for Explainable Recommendation" by Ma et al. (2024). The original
authors introduced XRec, a model-agnostic collaborative instruction-tuning
framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to provide users with
comprehensive explanations of generated recommendations. Our objective was to
replicate the results of the original paper, albeit using Llama 3 as the LLM
for evaluation instead of GPT-3.5-turbo. We built on the source code provided
by Ma et al. (2024) to achieve our goal. Our work extends the original paper by
modifying the input embeddings or deleting the output embeddings of XRec's
Mixture of Experts module. Based on our results, XRec effectively generates
personalized explanations and its stability is improved by incorporating
collaborative information. However, XRec did not consistently outperform all
baseline models in every metric. Our extended analysis further highlights the
importance of the Mixture of Experts embeddings in shaping the explanation
structures, showcasing how collaborative signals interact with language
modeling. Through our work, we provide an open-source evaluation implementation
that enhances accessibility for researchers and practitioners alike. Our

  This work investigates how a multilingual transformer model represents
morphosyntactic properties of questions. We introduce the Question Type and
Complexity (QTC) dataset with sentences across seven languages, annotated with
type information and complexity metrics including dependency length, tree
depth, and lexical density. Our evaluation extends probing methods to
regression labels with selectivity controls to quantify gains in
generalizability. We compare layer-wise probes on frozen Glot500-m (Imani et
al., 2023) representations against subword TF-IDF baselines, and a fine-tuned
model. Results show that statistical features classify questions effectively in
languages with explicit marking, while neural probes capture fine-grained
structural complexity patterns better. We use these results to evaluate when
contextual representations outperform statistical baselines and whether
parameter updates reduce the availability of pre-trained linguistic
information.

Title: LLM Bias Detection and Mitigation through the Lens of Desired
  Distributions
Authors: Ingroj Shrestha, Padmini Srinivasan
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025
\\
  Although prior work on bias mitigation has focused on promoting social
equality and demographic parity, less attention has been given to aligning
LLM's outputs to desired distributions. For example, we might want to align a
model with real-world distributions to support factual grounding. Thus, we
define bias as deviation from a desired distribution, which may be an equal or
real-world distribution, depending on application goals. We propose a weighted
adaptive loss based fine-tuning method that aligns LLM's gender-profession
output distribution with the desired distribution, while preserving language
modeling capability. Using 3 profession sets -- male-dominated,
female-dominated, and gender-balanced -- derived from U.S. labor statistics
(2024), we assess both our adaptive method for reflecting reality and a
non-adaptive variant for equality. Across three masked language models, bias is
observed under both distributions. We achieve near-complete mitigation under
equality and 30-75% reduction under real-world settings. Autoregressive LLMs
show no bias under equality but notable bias under real-world settings, with
the Llama Instruct models (3.2-3B, 3.1-8B) achieving a 50-62% reduction.

\\
  As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, creating pluralistic
systems that can accommodate the diverse preferences and values of users
worldwide becomes essential. We introduce EVALUESTEER, a benchmark to measure
LLMs' and reward models' (RMs) steerability towards users' value and stylistic
preference profiles grounded in psychology and human-LLM interaction
literature. To address the gap in existing datasets that do not support
controlled evaluations of RM steering, we synthetically generated 165,888
preference pairs -- systematically varying pairs along 4 value dimensions
(traditional, secular-rational, survival, and self-expression) and 4 style
dimensions (verbosity, readability, confidence, and warmth). We use EVALUESTEER
to evaluate whether, given a user profile and a pair of candidate value-laden
and style-laden responses, LLMs and RMs are able to select the output that
aligns with the user's preferences. We evaluate six open-source and proprietary
LLMs and RMs under sixteen systematic prompting conditions and six preference
comparison scenarios. Notably, our results show that, when given the user's
full profile of values and stylistic preferences, the best models achieve <75%
accuracy at choosing the correct response, in contrast to >99% accuracy when
only relevant style and value preferences are provided. EVALUESTEER thus
highlights the limitations of current RMs at identifying and adapting to
relevant user profile information, and provides a challenging testbed for
developing RMs that can be steered towards diverse human values and
preferences.

  Large-scale multimodal models achieve strong results on tasks like Visual
Question Answering (VQA), but they often fail when queries require culturally
grounded, everyday knowledge, particularly in low-resource and underrepresented
languages. To bridge this gap, we introduce Everyday Multimodal and
Multilingual QA (EverydayMMQA), a framework for creating large-scale,
culturally-grounded datasets for spoken and visual question answering (SVQA).
Using this framework, we developed OASIS, a multimodal dataset integrating
speech, images, and text. With over ~0.92M images and 14.8M QA pairs, OASIS
contains 3.7M spoken questions, enabling four unique input combinations:
speech-only, text-only, speech+image, and text+image. Focused on English and
Arabic varieties, 18 countries, the dataset content is curated to reflect
diverse, real-world situations. OASIS tests models on tasks beyond object
recognition that involve pragmatic, commonsense, and culturally aware
reasoning. We benchmarked four closed-source models, three open-source models,
and one fine-tuned model. EverydayMMQA and OASIS together provide a benchmark
and training dataset for building multimodal LLMs for a comprehensive set of
everyday tasks within cultural contexts. The framework and dataset will be made
publicly available to the community.

Title: Semantic Regexes: Auto-Interpreting LLM Features with a Structured
  Language
Authors: Angie Boggust and Donghao Ren and Yannick Assogba and Dominik Moritz
  and Arvind Satyanarayan and Fred Hohman
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Automated interpretability aims to translate large language model (LLM)
features into human understandable descriptions. However, these natural
language feature descriptions are often vague, inconsistent, and require manual
relabeling. In response, we introduce semantic regexes, structured language
descriptions of LLM features. By combining primitives that capture linguistic
and semantic feature patterns with modifiers for contextualization,
composition, and quantification, semantic regexes produce precise and
expressive feature descriptions. Across quantitative benchmarks and qualitative
analyses, we find that semantic regexes match the accuracy of natural language
while yielding more concise and consistent feature descriptions. Moreover,
their inherent structure affords new types of analyses, including quantifying
feature complexity across layers, scaling automated interpretability from
insights into individual features to model-wide patterns. Finally, in user
studies, we find that semantic regex descriptions help people build accurate
mental models of LLM feature activations.

Title: Protecting De-identified Documents from Search-based Linkage Attacks
Authors: Pierre Lison and Mark Anderson
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  While de-identification models can help conceal the identity of the
individual(s) mentioned in a document, they fail to address linkage risks,
defined as the potential to map the de-identified text back to its source. One
straightforward way to perform such linkages is to extract phrases from the
de-identified document and then check their presence in the original dataset.
This paper presents a method to counter search-based linkage attacks while
preserving the semantic integrity of the text. The method proceeds in two
steps. We first construct an inverted index of the N-grams occurring in the
document collection, making it possible to efficiently determine which N-grams
appear in less than $k$ documents (either alone or in combination with other
N-grams). An LLM-based rewriter is then iteratively queried to reformulate
those spans until linkage is no longer possible. Experimental results on a
collection of court cases show that the method is able to effectively prevent
search-based linkages while remaining faithful to the original content.

Title: Controllable Stylistic Text Generation with Train-Time
  Attribute-Regularized Diffusion
Authors: Fan Zhou, Chang Tian, Tim Van de Cruys
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Preprint under review
\\
  Generating stylistic text with specific attributes is a key problem in
controllable text generation. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for both visual and textual generation. Existing approaches
can be broadly categorized into classifier-free guidance (CFG) and classifier
guidance (CG) methods. While CFG effectively preserves semantic content, it
often fails to provide effective attribute control. In contrast, CG modifies
the denoising trajectory using classifier gradients, enabling better attribute
alignment but incurring high computational costs during sampling and suffering
from classifier generalization issues. In this work, we propose RegDiff, a
regularized diffusion framework that leverages attribute features without
requiring a pretrained classifier during sampling, thereby achieving
controllable generation with reduced computational costs. Specifically, RegDiff
employs a VAE-based encoder--decoder architecture to ensure reconstruction
fidelity and a latent diffusion model trained with attribute supervision to
enable controllable text generation. Attribute information is injected only
during training. Experiments on five datasets spanning multiple stylistic
attributes demonstrate that RegDiff outperforms strong baselines in generating
stylistic texts. These results validate the effectiveness of RegDiff as an
efficient solution for attribute-controllable text diffusion. Our code,
datasets, and resources will be released upon publication at

Title: Reward Model Perspectives: Whose Opinions Do Reward Models Reward?
Authors: Elle
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Published at EMNLP 2025 under the full author name "Elle"
\\
  Reward models (RMs) are central to the alignment of language models (LMs). An
RM often serves as a proxy for human preferences to guide downstream LM
behavior. However, our understanding of RM behavior is limited. Our work (i)
formalizes a framework for measuring the alignment of opinions captured by RMs,
(ii) investigates the extent to which RMs demonstrate sociodemographic biases,
and (iii) explores the effects of prompting to steer rewards towards the
preferences of a target group. We study the subjective and diverse perspectives
on controversial topics, which allows us to quantify RM perspectives in terms
of their opinions, attitudes, and values. We show that RMs are poorly aligned
with several demographic groups and can systematically reward harmful
stereotypes, and steering alone is not enough to overcome these limitations.
Our findings underscore the need for more careful consideration of RM behavior
in model alignment during preference learning to prevent the propagation of
unwanted social biases in the language technologies that we use.

Title: Instructional Goal-Aligned Question Generation for Student Evaluation in
  Virtual Lab Settings: How Closely Do LLMs Actually Align?
Authors: R. Alexander Knipper, Indrani Dey, Souvika Sarkar, Hari Narayanan,

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Virtual Labs offer valuable opportunities for hands-on, inquiry-based science
learning, yet teachers often struggle to adapt them to fit their instructional
goals. Third-party materials may not align with classroom needs, and developing
custom resources can be time-consuming and difficult to scale. Recent advances
in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for addressing these
limitations. In this paper, we introduce a novel alignment framework for
instructional goal-aligned question generation, enabling teachers to leverage
LLMs to produce simulation-aligned, pedagogically meaningful questions through
natural language interaction. The framework integrates four components:
instructional goal understanding via teacher-LLM dialogue, lab understanding
via knowledge unit and relationship analysis, a question taxonomy for
structuring cognitive and pedagogical intent, and the TELeR taxonomy for
controlling prompt detail. Early design choices were informed by a small
teacher-assisted case study, while our final evaluation analyzed over 1,100
questions from 19 open-source LLMs. With goal and lab understanding grounding
questions in teacher intent and simulation context, the question taxonomy
elevates cognitive demand (open-ended formats and relational types raise
quality by 0.29-0.39 points), and optimized TELeR prompts enhance format
adherence (80% parsability, >90% adherence). Larger models yield the strongest
gains: parsability +37.1%, adherence +25.7%, and average quality +0.8 Likert
points.

Title: FinLFQA: Evaluating Attributed Text Generation of LLMs in Financial
  Long-Form Question Answering
Authors: Yitao Long, Tiansheng Hu, Yilun Zhao, Arman Cohan, Chen Zhao
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP 2025 Findings
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate to long-form questions,
producing plausible yet factually incorrect answers. A common mitigation
strategy is to provide attribution to LLM outputs. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on simple attribution that retrieves supporting textual
evidence as references. We argue that in real-world scenarios such as financial
applications, attribution goes beyond reference retrieval. We introduce
FinLFQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate
long-form answers to complex financial questions with reliable and nuanced
attributions. FinLFQA evaluates three critical aspects of attribution through
human annotations: (1) supporting evidence extracted from financial reports,
(2) intermediate numerical reasoning steps, and (3) domain-specific financial
knowledge that informs the reasoning process. We further provide an automatic
evaluation framework covering both answer quality and attribution quality.
Through extensive experiments on eight LLMs across multiple
attribution-generation paradigms, we find that fine-grained metrics are
important to distinguish model capabilities, that end-to-end generation
achieves comparable performance to post-hoc approaches, and that iterative
refinement only helps when guided by external feedback.

  We introduce UniRST, the first unified RST-style discourse parser capable of

two training strategies: Multi-Head, which assigns separate relation
classification layer per inventory, and Masked-Union, which enables shared
parameter training through selective label masking. We first benchmark
monotreebank parsing with a simple yet effective augmentation technique for
low-resource settings. We then train a unified model and show that (1) the
parameter efficient Masked-Union approach is also the strongest, and (2) UniRST
outperforms 16 of 18 mono-treebank baselines, demonstrating the advantages of a
single-model, multilingual end-to-end discourse parsing across diverse
resources.

Title: MathRobust-LV: Evaluation of Large Language Models' Robustness to
  Linguistic Variations in Mathematical Reasoning
Authors: Neeraja Kirtane, Yuvraj Khanna, Peter Relan
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large language models excel on math benchmarks, but their math reasoning
robustness to linguistic variation is underexplored. While recent work
increasingly treats high-difficulty competitions like the IMO as the gold
standard for evaluating reasoning, we believe in comprehensive benchmarking of
high school-level math problems in real educational settings. We introduce
MathRobust-LV, a test set and evaluation methodology that mirrors how
instructors rephrase problems across assessments while keeping difficulty
constant: we change surface details (names, contexts, variables) while
preserving numerical structure and answers. In contrast to prior efforts that
alter problem content or emphasize IMO-level tasks, we focus on
high-school-level dataset problems at the difficulty level where models are
currently deployed in educational settings: tutoring and assessment systems. In
these applications, instructors rephrase identical concepts in varied ways,
making linguistic robustness essential for reliable deployment. Although MATH
data benchmarking is often regarded as saturated, our experiment on 34 models
reveals that accuracy declines when moving from the baseline to the variants.
These drops are severe for smaller models (9-11%) while stronger models also
show measurable degradation. Frontier models like GPT-5, Gemini-2.5pro remain
comparatively stable. Our results highlight that robustness to linguistic
variation is a fundamental challenge, exposing reasoning vulnerabilities in
models.

Title: Linguistically Informed Tokenization Improves ASR for Underresourced
  Languages
Authors: Massimo Daul, Alessio Tosolini, Claire Bowern
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a crucial tool for linguists aiming to
perform a variety of language documentation tasks. However, modern ASR systems
use data-hungry transformer architectures, rendering them generally unusable
for underresourced languages. We fine-tune a wav2vec2 ASR model on Yan-nhangu,
a dormant Indigenous Australian language, comparing the effects of phonemic and
orthographic tokenization strategies on performance. In parallel, we explore
ASR's viability as a tool in a language documentation pipeline. We find that a
linguistically informed phonemic tokenization system substantially improves WER
and CER compared to a baseline orthographic tokenization scheme. Finally, we
show that hand-correcting the output of an ASR model is much faster than
hand-transcribing audio from scratch, demonstrating that ASR can work for
underresourced languages.

Title: Test-Time Scaling of Reasoning Models for Machine Translation
Authors: Zihao Li, Shaoxiong Ji, J\"org Tiedemann
Categories: cs.CL
ACM-class: I.2.7
\\
  Test-time scaling (TTS) has enhanced the performance of Reasoning Models
(RMs) on various tasks such as math and coding, yet its efficacy in machine
translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper investigates whether
increased inference-time computation improves translation quality. We evaluate
12 RMs across a diverse suite of MT benchmarks spanning multiple domains,
examining three scenarios: direct translation, forced-reasoning extrapolation,
and post-editing. Our findings show that for general-purpose RMs, TTS provides
limited and inconsistent benefits for direct translation, with performance
quickly plateauing. However, the effectiveness of TTS is unlocked by
domain-specific fine-tuning, which aligns a model's reasoning process with task
requirements, leading to consistent improvements up to an optimal,
self-determined reasoning depth. We also find that forcing a model to reason
beyond its natural stopping point consistently degrades translation quality. In
contrast, TTS proves highly effective in a post-editing context, reliably
turning self-correction into a beneficial process. These results indicate that
the value of inference-time computation in MT lies not in enhancing single-pass
translation with general models, but in targeted applications like multi-step,
self-correction workflows and in conjunction with task-specialized models.

\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success through
imitation learning on vast text corpora, but this paradigm creates a
training-generation gap and limits robust reasoning. Reinforcement learning
(RL) offers a more data-efficient solution capable of bridging this gap, yet
its application has been constrained by a critical data bottleneck: existing RL
datasets are orders of magnitude smaller and less diverse than web-scale
pre-training corpora. To address this, we introduce the Webscale-RL pipeline, a
scalable data engine that systematically converts large-scale pre-training
documents into millions of diverse, verifiable question-answer pairs for RL.
Using this pipeline, we construct the Webscale-RL dataset, containing 1.2
million examples across more than 9 domains. Our experiments show that the
model trained on this dataset significantly outperforms continual pretraining
and strong data refinement baselines across a suite of benchmarks. Notably, RL
training with our dataset proves substantially more efficient, achieving the
performance of continual pre-training with up to 100$\times$ fewer tokens. Our
work presents a viable path toward scaling RL to pre-training levels, enabling
more capable and efficient language models.

Title: From Acceleration to Saturation: Scaling Behavior of Bootstrapped
  Language Model Pretraining

\\
  Bootstrapped pretraining, i.e., the reuse of a pretrained base model for
further pretraining, such as continual pretraining or model growth, is
promising at reducing the cost of training language models from scratch.
However, its effectiveness remains unclear, especially when applied to
overtrained base models. In this work, we empirically study the scaling
behavior of bootstrapped pretraining and find that its scaling efficiency
diminishes in a predictable manner: The scaling exponent with respect to
second-stage pretraining tokens decreases logarithmically with the number of
tokens used to pretrain the base model. The joint dependence on first- and
second-stage tokens is accurately modeled by a simple scaling law. Such
saturation effect reveals a fundamental trade-off in multi-stage pretraining
strategies: the more extensively a model is pretrained, the less additional
benefit bootstrapping provides. Our findings provide practical insights for
efficient language model training and raise important considerations for the
reuse of overtrained models.

Title: Flipping the Dialogue: Training and Evaluating User Language Models
Authors: Tarek Naous, Philippe Laban, Wei Xu, Jennifer Neville
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Conversations with LMs involve two participants: a human user leading the
conversation, and an LM assistant responding to the user's request. To satisfy
this specific role, LMs are post-trained to be helpful assistants -- optimized
to produce exhaustive and well-structured responses, free of ambiguity and
grammar errors. User utterances, on the other hand, are rarely perfected, with
each user phrasing requests in unique ways, sometimes putting in partial effort
at each turn and refining on the fly. To evaluate LM performance in realistic
settings, prior work simulated users in multi-turn conversations, often
prompting an LLM originally trained to be a helpful assistant to act as a user.
However, we show that assistant LMs make for poor user simulators, with the
surprising finding that better assistants yield worse simulators. Instead, we
introduce purpose-built User Language Models (User LMs) - models post-trained
to simulate human users in multi-turn conversations. Through various
evaluations, we show how User LMs align better with human behavior and achieve
better simulation robustness than existing simulation methods. When leveraging
User LMs to simulate coding and math conversations, the performance of a strong
assistant (GPT-4o) drops from 74.6% to 57.4%, confirming that more realistic
simulation environments lead to assistant struggles as they fail to cope with
the nuances of users in multi-turn setups.

Title: The Algebra of Meaning: Why Machines Need Montague More Than Moore's Law
Authors: Cheonkam Jeong, Sungdo Kim, Jewoo Park
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LO
\\
  Contemporary language models are fluent yet routinely mis-handle the types of
meaning their outputs entail. We argue that hallucination, brittle moderation,
and opaque compliance outcomes are symptoms of missing type-theoretic semantics
rather than data or scale limitations. Building on Montague's view of language
as typed, compositional algebra, we recast alignment as a parsing problem:
natural-language inputs must be compiled into structures that make explicit
their descriptive, normative, and legal dimensions under context.
  We present Savassan, a neuro-symbolic architecture that compiles utterances
into Montague-style logical forms and maps them to typed ontologies extended
with deontic operators and jurisdictional contexts. Neural components extract
candidate structures from unstructured inputs; symbolic components perform type
checking, constraint reasoning, and cross-jurisdiction mapping to produce
compliance-aware guidance rather than binary censorship. In cross-border
scenarios, the system "parses once" (e.g., defect claim(product x, company y))
and projects the result into multiple legal ontologies (e.g., defamation risk
in KR/JP, protected opinion in US, GDPR checks in EU), composing outcomes into
a single, explainable decision.
  This paper contributes: (i) a diagnosis of hallucination as a type error;
(ii) a formal Montague-ontology bridge for business/legal reasoning; and (iii)
a production-oriented design that embeds typed interfaces across the pipeline.
We outline an evaluation plan using legal reasoning benchmarks and synthetic
multi-jurisdiction suites. Our position is that trustworthy autonomy requires
compositional typing of meaning, enabling systems to reason about what is
described, what is prescribed, and what incurs liability within a unified
algebra of meaning.

  Automatic research with Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly gaining
importance, driving the development of increasingly complex workflows involving
multi-agent systems, planning, tool usage, code execution, and human-agent
interaction to accelerate research processes. However, as more researchers and
developers begin to use and build upon these tools and platforms, the
complexity and difficulty of extending and maintaining such agentic workflows

TinyScientist identifies the essential components of the automatic research
workflow and proposes an interactive, extensible, and controllable framework
that easily adapts to new tools and supports iterative growth. We provide an

Title: Do Internal Layers of LLMs Reveal Patterns for Jailbreak Detection?
Authors: Sri Durga Sai Sowmya Kadali and Evangelos E. Papalexakis
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a pressing concern
with the increasing prevalence and accessibility of conversational LLMs.
Adversarial users often exploit these models through carefully engineered
prompts to elicit restricted or sensitive outputs, a strategy widely referred
to as jailbreaking. While numerous defense mechanisms have been proposed,
attackers continuously develop novel prompting techniques, and no existing
model can be considered fully resistant. In this study, we investigate the
jailbreak phenomenon by examining the internal representations of LLMs, with a
focus on how hidden layers respond to jailbreak versus benign prompts.
Specifically, we analyze the open-source LLM GPT-J and the state-space model
Mamba2, presenting preliminary findings that highlight distinct layer-wise
behaviors. Our results suggest promising directions for further research on
leveraging internal model dynamics for robust jailbreak detection and defense.

Title: A Comparative Analysis of Contextual Representation Flow in State-Space
  and Transformer Architectures
Authors: Nhat M. Hoang, Do Xuan Long, Cong-Duy Nguyen, Min-Yen Kan, Luu Anh
  Tuan
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  State Space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformer-Based Models (TBMs) for long-sequence processing, offering linear
scaling and lower memory use. Yet, how contextual information flows across
layers and tokens in these architectures remains understudied. We present the
first unified, token- and layer-level analysis of representation propagation in
SSMs and TBMs. Using centered kernel alignment, stability metrics, and probing,
we characterize how representations evolve within and across layers. We find a
key divergence: TBMs rapidly homogenize token representations, with diversity
reemerging only in later layers, while SSMs preserve token uniqueness early but
converge to homogenization deeper. Theoretical analysis and parameter
randomization further reveal that oversmoothing in TBMs stems from
architectural design, whereas in SSMs it arises mainly from training dynamics.
These insights clarify the inductive biases of both architectures and inform
future model and training designs for long-context reasoning.

Title: Aligning Large Language Models via Fully Self-Synthetic Data
Authors: Shangjian Yin, Zhepei Wei, Xinyu Zhu, Wei-Lin Chen, Yu Meng
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for large
language models (LLMs) relies on expensive human-annotated datasets, while
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) also incurs significant costs,
requiring the collection of diverse prompts and corresponding responses, often
necessitating external reward models or proprietary models like GPT-4 to
annotate preference pairs. In this work, we introduce Self-Alignment
Optimization (SAO), a fully self-synthetic framework for LLM alignment, where
all training data, including prompts (i.e., user queries), responses, and
preferences, are generated by the model itself. Specifically, SAO first
instructs the LLM to engage in persona role-play and generate diverse prompts
and responses, which are then self-evaluated for preference optimization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAO effectively enhances the model's
chat capabilities on standard benchmarks like AlpacaEval~2.0, while maintaining
strong performance on downstream objective tasks (e.g., question-answering,
math reasoning). Our work provides a practical solution for self-improvement in
aligning LLMs, and the code for reproducing our results is available at:

Title: ToolMem: Enhancing Multimodal Agents with Learnable Tool Capability
  Memory
Authors: Yunzhong Xiao, Yangmin Li, Hewei Wang, Yunlong Tang, Zora Zhiruo Wang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Agents utilizing tools powered by large language models (LLMs) or
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in diverse
tasks across text and visual modalities. Unlike traditional tools such as
calculators, which give deterministic outputs, neural tools perform uncertainly
across task scenarios. While different tools for a task may excel in varied
scenarios, existing agents typically rely on fixed tools, thus limiting the
flexibility in selecting the most suitable tool for specific tasks. In
contrast, humans snowball their understanding of the capabilities of different
tools by interacting with them, and apply this knowledge to select the optimal
tool when solving a future task. To build agents that similarly benefit from
this process, we propose ToolMem that enables agents to develop memories of
tool capabilities from previous interactions, by summarizing their strengths
and weaknesses and storing them in memory; at inference, the agent can retrieve
relevant entries from ToolMem, and select the best tool to solve individual
tasks more accurately. We evaluate ToolMem on learning varied text generation
and text-to-image generation neural tools. Compared to no-memory, generic
agents, we find ToolMem-augmented agents predict tool performance 14.8% and
28.7% more accurately across text and multimodal generation scenarios.
Moreover, ToolMem facilitates optimal tool selection among multiple choices by
21% and 24% absolute increases in respective scenarios.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone
for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness depends
on high-quality instruction data. Most existing alignment datasets are either
private or require costly human annotation, which limits reproducibility and
scalability. Even with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF),
concerns about data quality remain. Moreover, it is unclear how much data is
actually required to fine-tune a base model into a strong instruction-following
model. Current approaches often rely on over 300k examples even at the
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, yet they still underperform compared to
proprietary models, creating barriers for academic and resource-limited
communities. To address this gap, we introduce PiKa, a data-efficient family of
expert-level alignment datasets. In particular, the PiKa-SFT dataset uses only
30k SFT examples, far fewer than state-of-the-art datasets like Magpie. Through
evaluations by fine-tuning Llama-3-8B-Base on PiKa and other public datasets,
we show that PiKa-SFT outperforms models trained on much larger data. On
AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, PiKa-SFT fine-tuning even surpasses
the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct model trained on over 10 million proprietary
examples. We further extend our study by training the Qwen2.5 series (0.5B to
7B) on PiKa-SFT, achieving consistent gains. These findings demonstrate that
high-quality alignment can be achieved with significantly less data, offering a
scalable path for open-source LLM alignment. Code and data:

  We introduce an incremental summarization system for customer support agents
that intelligently determines when to generate concise bullet notes during
conversations, reducing agents' context-switching effort and redundant review.
Our approach combines a fine-tuned Mixtral-8x7B model for continuous note
generation with a DeBERTa-based classifier to filter trivial content. Agent
edits refine the online notes generation and regularly inform offline model
retraining, closing the agent edits feedback loop. Deployed in production, our
system achieved a 3% reduction in case handling time compared to bulk
summarization (with reductions of up to 9% in highly complex cases), alongside
high agent satisfaction ratings from surveys. These results demonstrate that
incremental summarization with continuous feedback effectively enhances summary
quality and agent productivity at scale.

Title: Learning to Rewrite Prompts for Bootstrapping LLMs on Downstream Tasks
Authors: Qinhao Zhou, Xiang Xiang, Kun He, John E. Hopcroft
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG eess.AS
\\
  In recent years, the growing interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced prompt engineering, transitioning from manual design to
model-based optimization. Prompts for LLMs generally comprise two components:
the \textit{instruction}, which defines the task or objective, and the
\textit{input}, which is tailored to the instruction type. In natural language
generation (NLG) tasks such as machine translation, the \textit{input}
component is particularly critical, while the \textit{instruction} component
tends to be concise. Existing prompt engineering methods primarily focus on
optimizing the \textit{instruction} component for general tasks, often
requiring large-parameter LLMs as auxiliary tools. However, these approaches
exhibit limited applicability for tasks like machine translation, where the
\textit{input} component plays a more pivotal role. To address this limitation,
this paper introduces a novel prompt optimization method specifically designed
for machine translation tasks. The proposed approach employs a small-parameter
model trained using a back-translation-based strategy, significantly reducing
training overhead for single-task optimization while delivering highly
effective performance. With certain adaptations, this method can also be
extended to other downstream tasks.

Title: How Language Models Conflate Logical Validity with Plausibility: A
  Representational Analysis of Content Effects
Authors: Leonardo Bertolazzi, Sandro Pezzelle, Raffaelle Bernardi
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Both humans and large language models (LLMs) exhibit content effects: biases
in which the plausibility of the semantic content of a reasoning problem
influences judgments regarding its logical validity. While this phenomenon in
humans is best explained by the dual-process theory of reasoning, the
mechanisms behind content effects in LLMs remain unclear. In this work, we
address this issue by investigating how LLMs encode the concepts of validity
and plausibility within their internal representations. We show that both
concepts are linearly represented and strongly aligned in representational
geometry, leading models to conflate plausibility with validity. Using steering
vectors, we demonstrate that plausibility vectors can causally bias validity
judgements, and vice versa, and that the degree of alignment between these two
concepts predicts the magnitude of behavioral content effects across models.
Finally, we construct debiasing vectors that disentangle these concepts,
reducing content effects and improving reasoning accuracy. Our findings advance
understanding of how abstract logical concepts are represented in LLMs and
highlight representational interventions as a path toward more logical systems.

  Management
Authors: Miao Lu, Weiwei Sun, Weihua Du, Zhan Ling, Xuesong Yao, Kang Liu,
  Jiecao Chen
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  We study reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language model
(LLM) agents for long-horizon multi-turn tool use, where context length quickly
becomes a fundamental bottleneck. Existing RL pipelines can suffer from
degraded instruction following, excessive rollout costs, and most importantly,
strict context limits. To address these challenges, we introduce
summarization-based context management to training. In specific, it
periodically compresses the tool using history by LLM-generated summaries that
retain task-relevant information to keep a compact context while enabling the
agent to scale beyond the fixed context window. Building on this formulation,
we derive a policy gradient representation that seamlessly enables standard LLM
RL infrastructures to optimize both tool-use behaviors as well as summarization
strategies in an end-to-end fashion. We instantiate this framework with
\underline{SU}mmarization augmented \underline{P}olicy \underline{O}ptimization
(\texttt{SUPO}), an LLM RL algorithm that enables long-horizon training beyond
a fixed context limit. Experiments on interactive function calling and
searching tasks demonstrate that \texttt{SUPO} significantly improves the
success rate while maintaining the same or even lower working context length
compared to baselines. We also demonstrate that for complex searching tasks,
\texttt{SUPO} can further improve the evaluation performance when scaling
test-time maximum round of summarization beyond that of training time. Our
results establish summarization-based context management as a principled and
scalable approach for training RL agents beyond a fixed context length limit.

Title: PTEB: Towards Robust Text Embedding Evaluation via Stochastic
  Paraphrasing at Evaluation Time with LLMs
Authors: Manuel Frank and Haithem Afli
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Current evaluations of sentence embedding models typically rely on static
test beds such as the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). While
invaluable, repeated tuning on a fixed suite can inflate reported performance
and obscure real-world robustness. We introduce the Paraphrasing Text Embedding
Benchmark (PTEB), a dynamic protocol that stochastically generates
meaning-preserving paraphrases at evaluation time and aggregates results across
multiple runs. Using a cost-efficient LLM-based method grounded in semantic
textual similarity gold ratings, we show that LLMs generate token-diverse but
semantically preserving, paraphrases. Across 7 MTEB tasks, we validate our
hypothesis that the performance of sentence encoders is sensitive to changes in
token space even when semantics remain fixed. We also observe that smaller
models are not disproportionately affected relative to larger ones. Our results
are statistically robust over multiple runs and we extended our experiments to
3 multilingual datasets covering 10 languages. More generally, we aim to
propose a new evaluation paradigm in NLP that relies less on static,
pre-defined benchmarks but shifts towards dynamic, stochastic evaluation
leveraging eval-time compute.

Title: Are LLMs Reliable Rankers? Rank Manipulation via Two-Stage Token
  Optimization
Authors: Tiancheng Xing, Jerry Li, Yixuan Du, Xiyang Hu
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR
Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as rerankers in
information retrieval, yet their ranking behavior can be steered by small,
natural-sounding prompts. To expose this vulnerability, we present Rank
Anything First (RAF), a two-stage token optimization method that crafts concise
textual perturbations to consistently promote a target item in LLM-generated
rankings while remaining hard to detect. Stage 1 uses Greedy Coordinate
Gradient to shortlist candidate tokens at the current position by combining the
gradient of the rank-target with a readability score; Stage 2 evaluates those
candidates under exact ranking and readability losses using an entropy-based
dynamic weighting scheme, and selects a token via temperature-controlled
sampling. RAF generates ranking-promoting prompts token-by-token, guided by
dual objectives: maximizing ranking effectiveness and preserving linguistic
naturalness. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that RAF significantly
boosts the rank of target items using naturalistic language, with greater
robustness than existing methods in both promoting target items and maintaining
naturalness. These findings underscore a critical security implication:
LLM-based reranking is inherently susceptible to adversarial manipulation,
raising new challenges for the trustworthiness and robustness of modern
retrieval systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/glad-lab/RAF.

Title: AWM: Accurate Weight-Matrix Fingerprint for Large Language Models
Authors: Boyi Zeng, Lin Chen, Ziwei He, Xinbing Wang, Zhouhan Lin
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Protecting the intellectual property of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial, given the substantial resources required for their training.
Consequently, there is an urgent need for both model owners and third parties
to determine whether a suspect LLM is trained from scratch or derived from an
existing base model. However, the intensive post-training processes that models
typically undergo-such as supervised fine-tuning, extensive continued
pretraining, reinforcement learning, multi-modal extension, pruning, and
upcycling-pose significant challenges to reliable identification. In this work,
we propose a training-free fingerprinting method based on weight matrices. We
leverage the Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) and an unbiased Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA) similarity to neutralize the effects of parameter
manipulations, yielding a highly robust and high-fidelity similarity metric. On
a comprehensive testbed of 60 positive and 90 negative model pairs, our method
demonstrates exceptional robustness against all six aforementioned
post-training categories while exhibiting a near-zero risk of false positives.
By achieving perfect scores on all classification metrics, our approach
establishes a strong basis for reliable model lineage verification. Moreover,
the entire computation completes within 30s on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU. The code is

context of customer-facing chatbots, companies are dealing with large amounts
of user utterances that need to be clustered according to their intent. In
these commercial settings, no labeled data is typically available, and the
number of clusters is not known. Our method is based on iterative vector
updating: it constructs sparse vectors based on representative texts, and then
iteratively refines them through LLM guidance. Our method achieves comparable
or superior results to state-of-the-art methods that use contrastive learning,
but without assuming prior knowledge of clusters or labels. Experiments on
diverse datasets and smaller LLMs show that our method is model agnostic and
can be applied to any embedder, with relatively small LLMs, and different
clustering methods. We also show that our method scales to large datasets,
reducing the computational cost of the LLM. These low-resource, adaptable
settings and the scalability of our method make it more aligned with real-world
scenarios than existing clustering methods.

Title: A Formal Framework for Fluency-based Multi-Reference Evaluation in
  Grammatical Error Correction

  Evaluating grammatical error correction requires metrics that reflect the
diversity of valid human corrections rather than privileging a single
reference. Existing frameworks, largely edit-based and English-centric, rely on
rigid alignments between system and reference edits, limiting their
applicability in multilingual and generative settings. This paper introduces a
formal framework for \textit{fluency-based multi-reference evaluation}, framing
$n$-gram similarity as an aggregation problem over multiple legitimate
corrections. Within this formulation, we instantiate GLEU through four
aggregation strategies--\textsc{select-best}, \textsc{simple-average},
\textsc{weighted-average}, and \textsc{merged-counts}--and analyze their
properties of boundedness, monotonicity, and sensitivity to reference
variation. Empirical results on Czech, Estonian, Ukrainian, and Chinese corpora
show that these strategies capture complementary aspects of fluency and
coverage. The framework unifies multi-reference evaluation into a principled,
fluency-oriented approach that incorporates linguistic diversity without
penalizing legitimate variation.

Title: Gold-Switch: Training-Free Superposition of Slow- and Fast- Thinking
  LLMs
Authors: Jaeseong Lee, Dayoung Kwon, seung-won hwang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel in structured tasks by emulating
deliberate human reasoning but often suffer from overthinking, degrading
performance and wasting resources. One possible baseline is to deploy both LLM
and LRM, then route input by predicting whether it requires reasoning and may
cause overthinking. However, deploying multiple models can be costly or
impractical. We propose a superposed deployment strategy with a lightweight,
training-free regulation to optimize inference by switching one model on and
off. Instead of routing, we selectively unlearn from LRM at inference, scaling
down computation while preserving reasoning. By analyzing the cumulative energy
of singular values, we identify optimal low-rank projections to adjust
reasoning just right.

Title: Adaptive LLM-Symbolic Reasoning via Dynamic Logical Solver Composition
Authors: Lei Xu, Pierre Beckmann, Marco Valentino, Andr\'e Freitas
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Neuro-symbolic NLP methods aim to leverage the complementary strengths of
large language models and formal logical solvers. However, current approaches
are mostly static in nature, i.e., the integration of a target solver is
predetermined at design time, hindering the ability to employ diverse formal
inference strategies. To address this, we introduce an adaptive,
multi-paradigm, neuro-symbolic inference framework that: (1) automatically
identifies formal reasoning strategies from problems expressed in natural
language; and (2) dynamically selects and applies specialized formal logical
solvers via autoformalization interfaces. Extensive experiments on individual
and multi-paradigm reasoning tasks support the following conclusions: LLMs are
effective at predicting the necessary formal reasoning strategies with an
accuracy above 90 percent. This enables flexible integration with formal
logical solvers, resulting in our framework outperforming competing baselines
by 27 percent and 6 percent compared to GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively.
Moreover, adaptive reasoning can even positively impact pure LLM methods,
yielding gains of 10, 5, and 6 percent on zero-shot, CoT, and symbolic CoT
settings with GPT-4o. Finally, although smaller models struggle with adaptive
neuro-symbolic reasoning, post-training offers a viable path to improvement.
Overall, this work establishes the foundations for adaptive LLM-symbolic
reasoning, offering a path forward for unifying material and formal inferences
on heterogeneous reasoning challenges.

Title: Foundations of LLM Knowledge Materialization: Termination,
  Reproducibility, Robustness
Authors: Luca Giordano, Simon Razniewski
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, yet
measuring and systematizing this knowledge remains challenging. Converting it
into structured format, for example through recursive extraction approaches
such as the GPTKB methodology (Hu et al., 2025b), is still underexplored. Key
open questions include whether such extraction can terminate, whether its
outputs are reproducible, and how robust they are to variations. We
systematically study LLM knowledge materialization using miniGPTKBs
(domain-specific, tractable subcrawls), analyzing termination, reproducibility,
and robustness across three categories of metrics: yield, lexical similarity,
and semantic similarity. We experiment with four variations (seed, language,
randomness, model) and three illustrative domains (from history, entertainment,
and finance). Our findings show (i) high termination rates, though
model-dependent; (ii) mixed reproducibility; and (iii) robustness that varies
by perturbation type: high for seeds and temperature, lower for languages and
models. These results suggest that LLM knowledge materialization can reliably
surface core knowledge, while also revealing important limitations.

  Multi-Agent Collaboration Pipeline
Authors: Haotian Wu, Shufan Jiang, Chios Chen, Yiyang Feng, Hehai Lin, Heqing

\\
  As large language models (LLMs) advance in role-playing (RP) tasks, existing
benchmarks quickly become obsolete due to their narrow scope, outdated
interaction paradigms, and limited adaptability across diverse application
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FURINA-Builder, a novel
multi-agent collaboration pipeline that automatically constructs fully
customizable RP benchmarks at any scale. It enables evaluation of arbitrary
characters across diverse scenarios and prompt formats, as the first benchmark
builder in RP area for adaptable assessment. FURINA-Builder simulates dialogues
between a test character and other characters drawn from a well-constructed
character-scene pool, while an LLM judge selects fine-grained evaluation
dimensions and adjusts the test character's responses into final test
utterances. Using this pipeline, we build FURINA-Bench, a new comprehensive
role-playing benchmark featuring both established and synthesized test
characters, each assessed with dimension-specific evaluation criteria. Human
evaluation and preliminary separability analysis justify our pipeline and
benchmark design. We conduct extensive evaluations of cutting-edge LLMs and
find that o3 and DeepSeek-R1 achieve the best performance on English and
Chinese RP tasks, respectively. Across all models, established characters
consistently outperform synthesized ones, with reasoning capabilities further
amplifying this disparity. Interestingly, we observe that model scale does not
monotonically reduce hallucinations. More critically, for reasoning LLMs, we
uncover a novel trade-off: reasoning improves RP performance but simultaneously
increases RP hallucinations. This trade-off extends to a broader Pareto
frontier between RP performance and reliability for all LLMs. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of FURINA-Builder and the challenge posed by
FURINA-Bench.

PAN 2015 in order to interpret the robustness of the proposed approaches. We
found that the current iteration does not invite a large variety of approaches
as naive semantic similarity approaches based on embedding vectors provide
promising results of up to 0.8 recall and 0.5 precision. In contrast, most of
these approaches underperform significantly on the 2015 dataset, indicating a

  The Circuit Localization track of the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark
(MIB) evaluates methods for localizing circuits within large language models
(LLMs), i.e., subnetworks responsible for specific task behaviors. In this
work, we investigate whether ensembling two or more circuit localization
methods can improve performance. We explore two variants: parallel and
sequential ensembling. In parallel ensembling, we combine attribution scores
assigned to each edge by different methods-e.g., by averaging or taking the
minimum or maximum value. In the sequential ensemble, we use edge attribution
scores obtained via EAP-IG as a warm start for a more expensive but more
precise circuit identification method, namely edge pruning. We observe that
both approaches yield notable gains on the benchmark metrics, leading to a more
precise circuit identification approach. Finally, we find that taking a
parallel ensemble over various methods, including the sequential ensemble,
achieves the best results. We evaluate our approach in the BlackboxNLP 2025 MIB
Shared Task, comparing ensemble scores to official baselines across multiple
model-task combinations.

Title: Adaptive Tool Generation with Models as Tools and Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Chenpeng Wang and Xiaojie Cheng and Chunye Wang and Linfeng Yang and

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Tool-augmented language models have demonstrated strong capabilities, but
their reliance on live API access creates scalability and reliability
challenges during training and deployment. We propose MTR, a simulation-first
training framework for tool-augmented reasoning. Instead of relying on live
APIs, MTR learns from complete ReAct traces with schema-validated, simulated
observations. Our approach operates through a multi-agent architecture where a
ToolMaker generates task-specific, OpenAI-compatible tool interfaces, an
AutoAgent produces structured think-act-observe sequences, and a ToolActor
simulates realistic responses. Training proceeds in two stages: Stage-1
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) teaches 'trace grammar' from complete reasoning
sequences; Stage-2 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) optimizes strategy
with a composite trace reward that balances answer correctness and internal
consistency. Across four multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue,
2WikiMultiHopQA, Bamboogle), MTR attains competitive Exact Match (EM) scores to
live-API systems and excels on reasoning-intensive tasks, suggesting that
effective tool reasoning can be learned from structured traces without live
interactions.

Title: Mid-Training of Large Language Models: A Survey
Authors: Kaixiang Mo, Yuxin Shi, Weiwei Weng, Zhiqiang Zhou, Shuman Liu, Haibo
  Zhang, Anxiang Zeng
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are typically developed through large-scale
pre-training followed by task-specific fine-tuning. Recent advances highlight
the importance of an intermediate mid-training stage, where models undergo
multiple annealing-style phases that refine data quality, adapt optimization
schedules, and extend context length. This stage mitigates diminishing returns
from noisy tokens, stabilizes convergence, and expands model capability in late
training. Its effectiveness can be explained through gradient noise scale, the
information bottleneck, and curriculum learning, which together promote
generalization and abstraction. Despite widespread use in state-of-the-art
systems, there has been no prior survey of mid-training as a unified paradigm.
We introduce the first taxonomy of LLM mid-training spanning data distribution,
learning-rate scheduling, and long-context extension. We distill practical
insights, compile evaluation benchmarks, and report gains to enable structured
comparisons across models. We also identify open challenges and propose avenues
for future research and practice.

\\
  Gender bias in machine translation (MT) systems has been extensively
documented, but bias in automatic quality estimation (QE) metrics remains
comparatively underexplored. Existing studies suggest that QE metrics can also
exhibit gender bias, yet most analyses are limited by small datasets, narrow
occupational coverage, and restricted language variety. To address this gap, we
introduce a large-scale challenge set specifically designed to probe the
behavior of QE metrics when evaluating translations containing gender-ambiguous
occupational terms. Building on the GAMBIT corpus of English texts with
gender-ambiguous occupations, we extend coverage to three source languages that
are genderless or natural-gendered, and eleven target languages with
grammatical gender, resulting in 33 source-target language pairs. Each source
text is paired with two target versions differing only in the grammatical
gender of the occupational term(s) (masculine vs. feminine), with all dependent
grammatical elements adjusted accordingly. An unbiased QE metric should assign
equal or near-equal scores to both versions. The dataset's scale, breadth, and
fully parallel design, where the same set of texts is aligned across all
languages, enables fine-grained bias analysis by occupation and systematic
comparisons across languages.

Title: SID: Multi-LLM Debate Driven by Self Signals
Authors: Xuhang Chen, Zhifan Song, Deyi Ji, Shuo Gao, Lanyun Zhu
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across
diverse application domains. Recent work has explored Multi-LLM Agent Debate
(MAD) as a way to enhance performance by enabling multiple LLMs to discuss and
refine responses iteratively. Nevertheless, existing MAD methods predominantly
focus on utilizing external structures, such as debate graphs, using
LLM-as-a-Judge, while neglecting the application of self signals, such as token
logits and attention, that arise during generation. This omission leads to
redundant computation and potential performance degradation. In this paper, we
shift the focus to the self signals of multi-LLM debate and introduce a
Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID), which leverages two types of
self-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus, to
adaptively guide the debate process. Our approach enables high-confidence
agents to exit early at the model level and compress the redundant debate
contents based on the attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on various
LLMs and Multimodal LLMs across multiple challenging benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing MAD
techniques in accuracy but also reduces token consumption, highlighting the
effectiveness of utilizing self signals in enhancing both the performance and
efficiency of multi-agent debate systems. Our code will be available
at~\href{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}{\texttt{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}}.

approaches through comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we illustrate that QAD

  Preferences

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 9 pages
\\
  Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has been the dominant
approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
simplified this paradigm by replacing the reward and value models with
rule-based verifiers. A prominent example is Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). However, GRPO inherently suffers from a length bias, since the same
advantage is uniformly assigned to all tokens of a response. As a result,
longer responses distribute the reward over more tokens and thus contribute
disproportionately to gradient updates. Several variants, such as DAPO and Dr.
GRPO, modify the token-level aggregation of the loss, yet these methods remain
heuristic and offer limited interpretability regarding their implicit token
preferences. In this work, we explore the possibility of allowing the model to
learn its own token preference during optimization. We unify existing
frameworks under a single formulation and introduce a learnable parameter
$\lambda$ that adaptively controls token-level weighting. We use $\lambda$-GRPO
to denote our method, and we find that $\lambda$-GRPO achieves consistent
improvements over vanilla GRPO and DAPO on multiple mathematical reasoning
benchmarks. On Qwen2.5 models with 1.5B, 3B, and 7B parameters, $\lambda$-GRPO
improves average accuracy by $+1.9\%$, $+1.0\%$, and $+1.7\%$ compared to GRPO,
respectively. Importantly, these gains come without any modifications to the
training data or additional computational cost, highlighting the effectiveness
and practicality of learning token preferences.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Metadata plays a critical role in indexing, documenting, and analyzing
scientific literature, yet extracting it accurately and efficiently remains a
challenging task. Traditional approaches often rely on rule-based or
task-specific models, which struggle to generalize across domains and schema
variations. In this paper, we present MeXtract, a family of lightweight
language models designed for metadata extraction from scientific papers. The
models, ranging from 0.5B to 3B parameters, are built by fine-tuning Qwen 2.5
counterparts. In their size family, MeXtract achieves state-of-the-art
performance on metadata extraction on the MOLE benchmark. To further support
evaluation, we extend the MOLE benchmark to incorporate model-specific
metadata, providing an out-of-domain challenging subset. Our experiments show
that fine-tuning on a given schema not only yields high accuracy but also
transfers effectively to unseen schemas, demonstrating the robustness and
adaptability of our approach. We release all the code, datasets, and models
openly for the research community.

Title: LongRM: Revealing and Unlocking the Context Boundary of Reward Modeling
Authors: Zecheng Tang, Baibei Ji, Quantong Qiu, Haitian Wang, Xiaobo Liang,
  Juntao Li, Min Zhang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in aligning large language model (LLM)
with human preferences. As real-world applications increasingly involve long
history trajectories, e.g., LLM agent, it becomes indispensable to evaluate
whether a model's responses are not only high-quality but also grounded in and
consistent with the provided context. Yet, current RMs remain confined to
short-context settings and primarily focus on response-level attributes (e.g.,
safety or helpfulness), while largely neglecting the critical dimension of long
context-response consistency. In this work, we introduce Long-RewardBench, a
benchmark specifically designed for long-context RM evaluation, featuring both
Pairwise Comparison and Best-of-N tasks. Our preliminary study reveals that
even state-of-the-art generative RMs exhibit significant fragility in
long-context scenarios, failing to maintain context-aware preference judgments.
Motivated by the analysis of failure patterns observed in model outputs, we
propose a general multi-stage training strategy that effectively scales
arbitrary models into robust Long-context RMs (LongRMs). Experiments show that
our approach not only substantially improves performance on long-context
evaluation but also preserves strong short-context capability. Notably, our 8B
LongRM outperforms much larger 70B-scale baselines and matches the performance
of the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

Comments: Work in progress
\\
  Current large language models (LLMs) and spoken language models (SLMs) begin
thinking and taking actions only after the user has finished their turn. This
prevents the model from interacting during the user's turn and can lead to high
response latency while it waits to think. Consequently, thinking after
receiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction,
where real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting
that humans naturally "think while listening." In this paper, we propose
SHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken
chain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams
the input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received,
generates unspoken reasoning based on all previous speech and reasoning, while
the user continues speaking. SHANKS uses this unspoken reasoning to decide
whether to interrupt the user and to make tool calls to complete the task. We
demonstrate that SHANKS enhances real-time user-SLM interaction in two
scenarios: (1) when the user is presenting a step-by-step solution to a math
problem, SHANKS can listen, reason, and interrupt when the user makes a
mistake, achieving 37.1% higher interruption accuracy than a baseline that
interrupts without thinking; and (2) in a tool-augmented dialogue, SHANKS can
complete 56.9% of the tool calls before the user finishes their turn. Overall,
SHANKS moves toward models that keep thinking throughout the conversation, not
only after a turn ends. Animated illustrations of Shanks can be found at

  Math word problems (MWPs) are critical K-12 educational tools, and
customizing them to students' interests and ability levels can increase
learning outcomes. However, teachers struggle to find time to customize MWPs
for each student given large class sizes and increasing burnout. We propose
that LLMs can support math education by generating MWPs customized to student

expert-LLM judge approach to evaluate over 11,000 MWPs generated by open and
closed LLMs and develop the first teacher-annotated dataset for
standards-aligned educational MWP generation. We show the value of our data by
using it to train a 12B open model that matches the performance of larger and
more capable open models. We also use our teacher-annotated data to train a
text classifier that enables a 30B open LLM to outperform existing closed
baselines without any training. Next, we show our models' MWPs are more similar
to human-written MWPs than those from existing models. We conclude by
conducting the first study of customized LLM-generated MWPs with grade school
students, finding they perform similarly on our models' MWPs relative to
human-written MWPs but consistently prefer our customized MWPs.

Title: Probing Social Identity Bias in Chinese LLMs with Gendered Pronouns and
  Social Groups
Authors: Geng Liu, Feng Li, Junjie Mu, Mengxiao Zhu, Francesco Pierri
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in user-facing
applications, raising concerns about their potential to reflect and amplify
social biases. We investigate social identity framing in Chinese LLMs using
Mandarin-specific prompts across ten representative Chinese LLMs, evaluating
responses to ingroup ("We") and outgroup ("They") framings, and extending the
setting to 240 social groups salient in the Chinese context. To complement
controlled experiments, we further analyze Chinese-language conversations from
a corpus of real interactions between users and chatbots. Across models, we
observe systematic ingroup-positive and outgroup-negative tendencies, which are
not confined to synthetic prompts but also appear in naturalistic dialogue,
indicating that bias dynamics might strengthen in real interactions. Our study
provides a language-aware evaluation framework for Chinese LLMs, demonstrating
that social identity biases documented in English generalize
cross-linguistically and intensify in user-facing contexts.

\\
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach to mitigate
hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal applications, but its
reliability is critically dependent on the accuracy of the retrieval step. This
is particularly challenging in the legal domain, where large databases of
structurally similar documents often cause retrieval systems to fail. In this
paper, we address this challenge by first identifying and quantifying a
critical failure mode we term Document-Level Retrieval Mismatch (DRM), where
the retriever selects information from entirely incorrect source documents. To
mitigate DRM, we investigate a simple and computationally efficient technique
which we refer to as Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC). This method enhances
each text chunk with a document-level synthetic summary, thereby injecting
crucial global context that would otherwise be lost during a standard chunking
process. Our experiments on a diverse set of legal information retrieval tasks
show that SAC greatly reduces DRM and, consequently, also improves text-level
retrieval precision and recall. Interestingly, we find that a generic
summarization strategy outperforms an approach that incorporates legal expert
domain knowledge to target specific legal elements. Our work provides evidence
that this practical, scalable, and easily integrable technique enhances the
reliability of RAG systems when applied to large-scale legal document datasets.

  The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the
availability of high-quality post-training data, particularly
instruction-tuning and preference-based examples. Existing open-source
datasets, however, often lack multilingual coverage, cultural grounding, and
suffer from task diversity gaps that are especially pronounced for Indian
languages. We introduce a human-in-the-loop pipeline that combines translations
with synthetic expansion to produce reliable and diverse Indic post-training
data. Using this pipeline, we curate two datasets: Pragyaan-IT (22.5K) and
Pragyaan-Align (100K) across 10 Indian languages covering 13 broad and 56
sub-categories, leveraging 57 diverse datasets. Our dataset protocol
incorporates several often-overlooked dimensions and emphasize task diversity,
multi-turn dialogue, instruction fidelity, safety alignment, and preservation
of cultural nuance, providing a foundation for more inclusive and effective
multilingual LLMs.

Title: Native Hybrid Attention for Efficient Sequence Modeling
Authors: Jusen Du, Jiaxi Hu, Tao Zhang, Weigao Sun, Yu Cheng
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Technical report, 16 pages
\\
  Transformers excel at sequence modeling but face quadratic complexity, while
linear attention offers improved efficiency but often compromises recall
accuracy over long contexts. In this work, we introduce Native Hybrid Attention
(NHA), a novel hybrid architecture of linear and full attention that integrates
both intra \& inter-layer hybridization into a unified layer design. NHA
maintains long-term context in key-value slots updated by a linear RNN, and
augments them with short-term tokens from a sliding window. A single
\texttt{softmax attention} operation is then applied over all keys and values,
enabling per-token and per-head context-dependent weighting without requiring
additional fusion parameters. The inter-layer behavior is controlled through a
single hyperparameter, the sliding window size, which allows smooth adjustment
between purely linear and full attention while keeping all layers structurally
uniform. Experimental results show that NHA surpasses Transformers and other
hybrid baselines on recall-intensive and commonsense reasoning tasks.
Furthermore, pretrained LLMs can be structurally hybridized with NHA, achieving
competitive accuracy while delivering significant efficiency gains. Code is
available at https://github.com/JusenD/NHA.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  LLMs are remarkable artifacts that have revolutionized a range of NLP and AI
tasks. A significant contributor is their factual knowledge, which, to date,
remains poorly understood, and is usually analyzed from biased samples. In this
paper, we take a deep tour into the factual knowledge (or beliefs) of a
frontier LLM, based on GPTKB v1.5 (Hu et al., 2025a), a recursively elicited
set of 100 million beliefs of one of the strongest currently available frontier
LLMs, GPT-4.1. We find that the models' factual knowledge differs quite
significantly from established knowledge bases, and that its accuracy is
significantly lower than indicated by previous benchmarks. We also find that
inconsistency, ambiguity and hallucinations are major issues, shedding light on
future research opportunities concerning factual LLM knowledge.

  Code-switching (CSW), the alternation of languages and scripts within a
single utterance, remains a fundamental challenge for multiling ual NLP, even
amidst the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs). Most LLMs still
struggle with mixed-language inputs, limited CSW datasets, and evaluation
biases, hindering deployment in multilingual societies. This survey provides
the first comprehensive analysis of CSW-aware LLM research, reviewing
\total{unique_references} studies spanning five research areas, 12 NLP tasks,
30+ datasets, and 80+ languages. We classify recent advances by architecture,
training strategy, and evaluation methodology, outlining how LLMs have reshaped
CSW modeling and what challenges persist. The paper concludes with a roadmap
emphasizing the need for inclusive datasets, fair evaluation, and
linguistically grounded models to achieve truly multilingual intelligence. A

Title: Search-R3: Unifying Reasoning and Embedding Generation in Large Language
  Models
Authors: Yuntao Gui and James Cheng
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
ACM-class: I.2.7
\\
  Despite their remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been underutilized for retrieval tasks. We present
Search-R3, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by adapting LLMs to
generate search embeddings as a direct output of their reasoning process. Our
approach exploits LLMs' chain-of-thought capabilities, allowing them to produce
more effective embeddings by reasoning step-by-step through complex semantic
analyses. We implement this through three complementary mechanisms. (1) a
supervised learning stage enables the model's ability to produce quality
embeddings, (2) a reinforcement learning (RL) methodology that optimizes
embedding generation alongside reasoning, and (3) a specialized RL environment
that efficiently handles evolving embedding representations without requiring
complete corpus re-encoding at each training iteration. Our extensive
evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Search-R3 significantly
outperforms prior methods by unifying the reasoning and embedding generation
processes. This integrated post-training approach represents a substantial
advancement in handling complex knowledge-intensive tasks that require both
sophisticated reasoning and effective information retrieval. Project page:

Title: Does Local News Stay Local?: Online Content Shifts in Sinclair-Acquired
  Stations
Authors: Miriam Wanner, Sophia Hager, Anjalie Field
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Local news stations are often considered to be reliable sources of
non-politicized information, particularly local concerns that residents care
about. Because these stations are trusted news sources, viewers are
particularly susceptible to the information they report. The Sinclair Broadcast
group is a broadcasting company that has acquired many local news stations in
the last decade. We investigate the effects of local news stations being
acquired by Sinclair: how does coverage change? We use computational methods to
investigate changes in internet content put out by local news stations before
and after being acquired by Sinclair and in comparison to national news
outlets. We find that there is clear evidence that local news stations report
more frequently on national news at the expense of local topics, and that their
coverage of polarizing national topics increases.

Title: Revisiting Metric Reliability for Fine-grained Evaluation of Machine
  Translation and Summarization in Indian Languages
Authors: Amir Hossein Yari, Kalmit Kulkarni, Ahmad Raza Khan, Fajri Koto
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 18 pages, 14 figures
\\
  While automatic metrics drive progress in Machine Translation (MT) and Text
Summarization (TS), existing metrics have been developed and validated almost
exclusively for English and other high-resource languages. This narrow focus
leaves Indian languages, spoken by over 1.5 billion people, largely overlooked,
casting doubt on the universality of current evaluation practices. To address
this gap, we introduce ITEM, a large-scale benchmark that systematically
evaluates the alignment of 26 automatic metrics with human judgments across six
major Indian languages, enriched with fine-grained annotations. Our extensive
evaluation, covering agreement with human judgments, sensitivity to outliers,
language-specific reliability, inter-metric correlations, and resilience to
controlled perturbations, reveals four central findings: (1) LLM-based
evaluators show the strongest alignment with human judgments at both segment
and system levels; (2) outliers exert a significant impact on metric-human
agreement; (3) in TS, metrics are more effective at capturing content fidelity,
whereas in MT, they better reflect fluency; and (4) metrics differ in their
robustness and sensitivity when subjected to diverse perturbations.
Collectively, these findings offer critical guidance for advancing metric
design and evaluation in Indian languages.

\\
  Instruction tuning has become a key technique for enhancing the performance
of large language models, enabling them to better follow human prompts.
However, low-resource languages such as Luxembourgish face severe limitations
due to the lack of high-quality instruction datasets. Traditional reliance on
machine translation often introduces semantic misalignment and cultural
inaccuracies. In this work, we address these challenges by creating a
cross-lingual instruction tuning dataset for Luxembourgish, without resorting
to machine-generated translations into it. Instead, by leveraging aligned data
from English, French, and German, we build a high-quality dataset that
preserves linguistic and cultural nuances. We provide evidence that
cross-lingual instruction tuning not only improves representational alignment
across languages but also the model's generative capabilities in Luxembourgish.
This highlights how cross-lingual data curation can avoid the common pitfalls
of machine-translated data and directly benefit low-resource language
development.

Comments: 21 pages, 4 figures. Under review
\\
  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) represent a significant advancement
in text generation, offering parallel token decoding capabilities. However,
existing open-source implementations suffer from quality-speed trade-offs that
impede their practical deployment. Conservative sampling strategies typically
decode only the most confident token per step to ensure quality (i.e., greedy
decoding), at the cost of inference efficiency due to repeated redundant
refinement iterations--a phenomenon we term delayed decoding. Through
systematic analysis of dLLM decoding dynamics, we characterize this delayed
decoding behavior and propose a training-free adaptive parallel decoding
strategy, named LocalLeap, to address these inefficiencies. LocalLeap is built
on two fundamental empirical principles: local determinism propagation centered
on high-confidence anchors and progressive spatial consistency decay. By
applying these principles, LocalLeap identifies anchors and performs localized
relaxed parallel decoding within bounded neighborhoods, achieving substantial
inference step reduction through early commitment of already-determined tokens
without compromising output quality. Comprehensive evaluation on various
benchmarks demonstrates that LocalLeap achieves 6.94$\times$ throughput
improvements and reduces decoding steps to just 14.2\% of the original
requirement, achieving these gains with negligible performance impact. The
source codes are available at: https://github.com/friedrichor/LocalLeap.

Title: All Claims Are Equal, but Some Claims Are More Equal Than Others:
  Importance-Sensitive Factuality Evaluation of LLM Generations
Authors: Miriam Wanner, Leif Azzopardi, Paul Thomas, Soham Dan, Benjamin Van
  Durme, Nick Craswell
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Existing methods for evaluating the factuality of large language model (LLM)
responses treat all claims as equally important. This results in misleading
evaluations when vital information is missing or incorrect as it receives the
same weight as peripheral details, raising the question: how can we reliably
detect such differences when there are errors in key information? Current
approaches that measure factuality tend to be insensitive to omitted or false
key information. To investigate this lack of sensitivity, we construct
VITALERRORS, a benchmark of 6,733 queries with minimally altered LLM responses
designed to omit or falsify key information. Using this dataset, we demonstrate
the insensitivities of existing evaluation metrics to key information errors.
To address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a set of metrics that provide greater
sensitivity in measuring the factuality of responses by incorporating the
relevance and importance of claims with respect to the query. Our analysis
demonstrates that VITAL metrics more reliably detect errors in key information
than previous methods. Our dataset, metrics, and analysis provide a foundation
for more accurate and robust assessment of LLM factuality.

Title: Making Machines Sound Sarcastic: LLM-Enhanced and Retrieval-Guided
  Sarcastic Speech Synthesis
Authors: Zhu Li, Yuqing Zhang, Xiyuan Gao, Shekhar Nayak, Matt Coler
Categories: cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS
\\
  Sarcasm is a subtle form of non-literal language that poses significant
challenges for speech synthesis due to its reliance on nuanced semantic,
contextual, and prosodic cues. While existing speech synthesis research has
focused primarily on broad emotional categories, sarcasm remains largely
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented framework for sarcasm-aware speech synthesis. Our approach
combines (1) semantic embeddings from a LoRA-fine-tuned LLaMA 3, which capture
pragmatic incongruity and discourse-level cues of sarcasm, and (2) prosodic
exemplars retrieved via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module, which
provide expressive reference patterns of sarcastic delivery. Integrated within
a VITS backbone, this dual conditioning enables more natural and contextually
appropriate sarcastic speech. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms baselines in both objective measures and subjective evaluations,
yielding improvements in speech naturalness, sarcastic expressivity, and
downstream sarcasm detection.

Title: TALENT: Table VQA via Augmented Language-Enhanced Natural-text
  Transcription
Authors: Guo Yutong, Wanying Wang, Yue Wu, Zichen Miao, Haoyu Wang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Table Visual Question Answering (Table VQA) is typically addressed by large
vision-language models (VLMs). While such models can answer directly from
images, they often miss fine-grained details unless scaled to very large sizes,
which are computationally prohibitive, especially for mobile deployment. A
lighter alternative is to have a small VLM perform OCR and then use a large
language model (LLM) to reason over structured outputs such as Markdown tables.
However, these representations are not naturally optimized for LLMs and still
introduce substantial errors. We propose TALENT (Table VQA via Augmented
Language-Enhanced Natural-text Transcription), a lightweight framework that
leverages dual representations of tables. TALENT prompts a small VLM to produce
both OCR text and natural language narration, then combines them with the
question for reasoning by an LLM. This reframes Table VQA as an LLM-centric
multimodal reasoning task, where the VLM serves as a perception-narration
module rather than a monolithic solver. Additionally, we construct ReTabVQA, a
more challenging Table VQA dataset requiring multi-step quantitative reasoning
over table images. Experiments show that TALENT enables a small VLM-LLM
combination to match or surpass a single large VLM at significantly lower
computational cost on both public datasets and ReTabVQA.

  Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks involve subjectivity, ambiguity,
or legitimate disagreement between annotators. In this paper, we outline our
system for modeling human variation. Our system leverages language models'
(LLMs) in-context learning abilities, along with a two-step meta-learning
training procedure for 1) post-training on many datasets requiring in-context
learning and 2) specializing the model via in-context meta-learning to the
particular data distribution of interest. We also evaluate the performance of
our system submission to the Learning With Disagreements (LeWiDi) competition,
where it was the overall winner on both tasks. Additionally, we perform an
ablation study to measure the importance of each system component. We find that
including rater examples in-context is crucial for our system's performance,
dataset-specific fine-tuning is helpful on the larger datasets, post-training
on other in-context datasets is helpful on one of the competition datasets, and
that performance improves with model scale.

  Instruction Tuning

Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Instruction tuning is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) to
downstream tasks and commonly relies on large, diverse corpora. However, small,
high-quality subsets, known as coresets, can deliver comparable or superior
results, though curating them remains challenging. Existing methods often rely
on coarse, sample-level signals like gradients, an approach that is
computationally expensive and overlooks fine-grained features. To address this,
we introduce TRIM (Token Relevance via Interpretable Multi-layer Attention), a
forward-only, token-centric framework. Instead of using gradients, TRIM
operates by matching underlying representational patterns identified via
attention-based "fingerprints" from a handful of target samples. Such an
approach makes TRIM highly efficient and uniquely sensitive to the structural
features that define a task. Coresets selected by our method consistently
outperform state-of-the-art baselines by up to 9% on downstream tasks and even
surpass the performance of full-data fine-tuning in some settings. By avoiding
expensive backward passes, TRIM achieves this at a fraction of the
computational cost. These findings establish TRIM as a scalable and efficient
alternative for building high-quality instruction-tuning datasets.

Title: Comparing human and language models sentence processing difficulties on

Authors: Samuel Joseph Amouyal and Aya Meltzer-Asscher and Jonathan Berant
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Data and code will be released soon
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) that fluently converse with humans are a reality
- but do LLMs experience human-like processing difficulties? We systematically
compare human and LLM sentence comprehension across seven challenging
linguistic structures. We collect sentence comprehension data from humans and
five families of state-of-the-art LLMs, varying in size and training procedure
in a unified experimental framework. Our results show LLMs overall struggle on
the target structures, but especially on garden path (GP) sentences. Indeed,
while the strongest models achieve near perfect accuracy on non-GP structures
(93.7% for GPT-5), they struggle on GP structures (46.8% for GPT-5).
Additionally, when ranking structures based on average performance, rank
correlation between humans and models increases with parameter count. For each
target structure, we also collect data for their matched baseline without the
difficult structure. Comparing performance on the target vs. baseline
sentences, the performance gap observed in humans holds for LLMs, with two
exceptions: for models that are too weak performance is uniformly low across
both sentence types, and for models that are too strong the performance is
uniformly high. Together, these reveal convergence and divergence in human and
LLM sentence comprehension, offering new insights into the similarity of humans
and LLMs.

Title: Reasoning for Hierarchical Text Classification: The Case of Patents
Authors: Lekang Jiang, Wenjun Sun, Stephan Goetz
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 15 pages, 10 tables, 3 figures
\\
  Hierarchical text classification (HTC) assigns documents to multiple levels
of a pre-defined taxonomy. Automated patent subject classification represents
one of the hardest HTC scenarios because of domain knowledge difficulty and a
huge number of labels. Prior approaches only output a flat label set, which
offers little insight into the reason behind predictions. Therefore, we propose
Reasoning for Hierarchical Classification (RHC), a novel framework that
reformulates HTC as a step-by-step reasoning task to sequentially deduce
hierarchical labels. RHC trains large language models (LLMs) in two stages: a
cold-start stage that aligns outputs with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
format and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to enhance multi-step reasoning
ability. RHC demonstrates four advantages in our experiments. (1)
Effectiveness: RHC surpasses previous baselines and outperforms the supervised
fine-tuning counterparts by approximately 3% in accuracy and macro F1. (2)
Explainability: RHC produces natural-language justifications before prediction
to facilitate human inspection. (3) Scalability: RHC scales favorably with
model size with larger gains compared to standard fine-tuning. (4)
Applicability: Beyond patents, we further demonstrate that RHC achieves
state-of-the-art performance on other widely used HTC benchmarks, which
highlights its broad applicability.

  The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) play a critical

utility in real-world pipelines remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct

simply scaling up data volume. This study provides actionable guidance for
integrating training data to enhance LLM capabilities, supporting both

introduce NurseLLM, the first nursing-specialized LLM tailored for multiple
choice question-answering (MCQ) tasks. We develop a multi-stage data generation
pipeline to build the first large scale nursing MCQ dataset to train LLMs on a
broad spectrum of nursing topics. We further introduce multiple nursing
benchmarks to enable rigorous evaluation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that NurseLLM outperforms SoTA general-purpose and medical-specialized LLMs of
comparable size on different benchmarks, underscoring the importance of a
specialized LLM for the nursing domain. Finally, we explore the role of
reasoning and multi-agent collaboration systems in nursing, highlighting their
promise for future research and applications.

Title: Quantifying Data Contamination in Psychometric Evaluations of LLMs
Authors: Jongwook Han, Woojung Song, Jonggeun Lee, Yohan Jo
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: 12 pages, 1 figure
\\
  Recent studies apply psychometric questionnaires to Large Language Models
(LLMs) to assess high-level psychological constructs such as values,
personality, moral foundations, and dark traits. Although prior work has raised
concerns about possible data contamination from psychometric inventories, which
may threaten the reliability of such evaluations, there has been no systematic
attempt to quantify the extent of this contamination. To address this gap, we
propose a framework to systematically measure data contamination in
psychometric evaluations of LLMs, evaluating three aspects: (1) item
memorization, (2) evaluation memorization, and (3) target score matching.
Applying this framework to 21 models from major families and four widely used
psychometric inventories, we provide evidence that popular inventories such as
the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44) and Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-40)
exhibit strong contamination, where models not only memorize items but can also
adjust their responses to achieve specific target scores.

Title: CARPAS: Towards Content-Aware Refinement of Provided Aspects for
  Summarization in Large Language Models
Authors: Yong-En Tian, Yu-Chien Tang, An-Zi Yen, Wen-Chih Peng
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 22 pages, 17 figures
\\
  Aspect-based summarization has attracted significant attention for its
ability to generate more fine-grained and user-aligned summaries. While most
existing approaches assume a set of predefined aspects as input, real-world
scenarios often present challenges where these given aspects may be incomplete,
irrelevant, or entirely missing from the document. Users frequently expect
systems to adaptively refine or filter the provided aspects based on the actual
content. In this paper, we initiate this novel task setting, termed
Content-Aware Refinement of Provided Aspects for Summarization (CARPAS), with
the aim of dynamically adjusting the provided aspects based on the document
context before summarizing. We construct three new datasets to facilitate our
pilot experiments, and by using LLMs with four representative prompting
strategies in this task, we find that LLMs tend to predict an overly
comprehensive set of aspects, which often results in excessively long and
misaligned summaries. Building on this observation, we propose a preliminary
subtask to predict the number of relevant aspects, and demonstrate that the
predicted number can serve as effective guidance for the LLMs, reducing the
inference difficulty, and enabling them to focus on the most pertinent aspects.
Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach significantly
improves performance across all datasets. Moreover, our deeper analyses uncover
LLMs' compliance when the requested number of aspects differs from their own
estimations, establishing a crucial insight for the deployment of LLMs in
similar real-world applications.

Title: Biasless Language Models Learn Unnaturally: How LLMs Fail to Distinguish
  the Possible from the Impossible
Authors: Imry Ziv, Nur Lan, Emmanuel Chemla, Roni Katzir
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 15 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Are large language models (LLMs) sensitive to the distinction between humanly
possible languages and humanly impossible languages? This question is taken by
many to bear on whether LLMs and humans share the same innate learning biases.
Previous work has attempted to answer it in the positive by comparing LLM
learning curves on existing language datasets and on "impossible" datasets
derived from them via various perturbation functions. Using the same
methodology, we examine this claim on a wider set of languages and impossible
perturbations. We find that in most cases, GPT-2 learns each language and its
impossible counterpart equally easily, in contrast to previous claims. We also
apply a more lenient condition by testing whether GPT-2 provides any kind of
separation between the whole set of natural languages and the whole set of
impossible languages. By considering cross-linguistic variance in various
metrics computed on the perplexity curves, we show that GPT-2 provides no
systematic separation between the possible and the impossible. Taken together,
these perspectives show that LLMs do not share the human innate biases that
shape linguistic typology.

  There are more than 2000 living languages in Africa, most of which have been
bypassed by advances in language technology. Current leading LLMs exhibit
strong performance on a number of the most common languages (e.g. Swahili or
Yoruba), but prioritise support for the languages with the most speakers first,
resulting in piecemeal ability across disparate languages. We contend that a
regionally focussed approach is more efficient, and present a case study for
Uganda, a country with high linguistic diversity. We describe the development
of Sunflower 14B and 32B, a pair of models based on Qwen 3 with state of the
art comprehension in the majority of all Ugandan languages. These models are
open source and can be used to reduce language barriers in a number of
important practical applications.

  Large language models exhibit strong multilingual capabilities despite
limited exposure to non-English data. Prior studies show that English-centric
large language models map multilingual content into English-aligned
representations at intermediate layers and then project them back into
target-language token spaces in the final layer. From this observation, we
hypothesize that this cross-lingual transition is governed by a small and
sparse set of dimensions, which occur at consistent indices across the
intermediate to final layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple,
training-free method to identify and manipulate these dimensions, requiring
only as few as 50 sentences of either parallel or monolingual data. Experiments
on a multilingual generation control task reveal the interpretability of these
dimensions, demonstrating that the interventions in these dimensions can switch
the output language while preserving semantic content, and that it surpasses
the performance of prior neuron-based approaches at a substantially lower cost.

Title: How much speech data is necessary for ASR in African languages? An
  evaluation of data scaling in Kinyarwanda and Kikuyu
Authors: Benjamin Akera, Evelyn Nafula, Patrick Walukagga, Gilbert Yiga, John
  Quinn, Ernest Mwebaze
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The development of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for
low-resource African languages remains challenging due to limited transcribed
speech data. While recent advances in large multilingual models like OpenAI's
Whisper offer promising pathways for low-resource ASR development, critical
questions persist regarding practical deployment requirements. This paper
addresses two fundamental concerns for practitioners: determining the minimum
data volumes needed for viable performance and characterizing the primary
failure modes that emerge in production systems. We evaluate Whisper's
performance through comprehensive experiments on two Bantu languages:
systematic data scaling analysis on Kinyarwanda using training sets from 1 to
1,400 hours, and detailed error characterization on Kikuyu using 270 hours of
training data. Our scaling experiments demonstrate that practical ASR
performance (WER < 13\%) becomes achievable with as little as 50 hours of
training data, with substantial improvements continuing through 200 hours (WER
< 10\%). Complementing these volume-focused findings, our error analysis
reveals that data quality issues, particularly noisy ground truth
transcriptions, account for 38.6\% of high-error cases, indicating that careful
data curation is as critical as data volume for robust system performance.
These results provide actionable benchmarks and deployment guidance for teams
developing ASR systems across similar low-resource language contexts. We

  Small Language models (SLMs) offer an efficient and accessible alternative to
Large Language Models (LLMs), delivering strong performance while using far
fewer resources. We introduce a simple and effective framework for pretraining
SLMs that brings together three complementary ideas. First, we identify
structurally sparse sub-network initializations that consistently outperform
randomly initialized models of similar size under the same compute budget.
Second, we use evolutionary search to automatically discover high-quality
sub-network initializations, providing better starting points for pretraining.
Third, we apply knowledge distillation from larger teacher models to speed up
training and improve generalization. Together, these components make SLM
pretraining substantially more efficient: our best model, discovered using
evolutionary search and initialized with LLM weights, matches the validation
perplexity of a comparable Pythia SLM while requiring 9.2x fewer pretraining
tokens. We release all code and models at
https://github.com/whittle-org/whittle/, offering a practical and reproducible
path toward cost-efficient small language model development at scale.

Title: Customer-R1: Personalized Simulation of Human Behaviors via RL-based LLM
  Agent in Online Shopping
Authors: Ziyi Wang, Yuxuan Lu, Yimeng Zhang, Jing Huang, Dakuo Wang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Simulating step-wise human behavior with Large Language Models (LLMs) has
become an emerging research direction, enabling applications in various
practical domains. While prior methods, including prompting, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in
modeling step-wise behavior, they primarily learn a population-level policy
without conditioning on a user's persona, yielding generic rather than
personalized simulations. In this work, we pose a critical question: how can
LLM agents better simulate personalized user behavior? We introduce
Customer-R1, an RL-based method for personalized, step-wise user behavior
simulation in online shopping environments. Our policy is conditioned on an
explicit persona, and we optimize next-step rationale and action generation via
action correctness reward signals. Experiments on the OPeRA dataset emonstrate
that Customer-R1 not only significantly outperforms prompting and SFT-based
baselines in next-action prediction tasks, but also better matches users'
action distribution, indicating higher fidelity in personalized behavior
simulation.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI

  Causal reasoning is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to
understand genuine cause-and-effect relationships beyond pattern matching.
Existing benchmarks suffer from critical limitations such as reliance on
synthetic data and narrow domain coverage. We introduce a novel benchmark
constructed from casually identified relationships extracted from top-tier
economics and finance journals, drawing on rigorous methodologies including
instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity
designs. Our benchmark comprises 40,379 evaluation items covering five task
types across domains such as health, environment, technology, law, and culture.
Experimental results on eight state-of-the-art LLMs reveal substantial
limitations, with the best model achieving only 57.6\% accuracy. Moreover,
model scale does not consistently translate to superior performance, and even
advanced reasoning models struggle with fundamental causal relationship
identification. These findings underscore a critical gap between current LLM
capabilities and demands of reliable causal reasoning in high-stakes
applications.

  Question answering over visually rich documents (VRDs) requires reasoning not
only over isolated content but also over documents' structural organization and
cross-page dependencies. However, conventional retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) methods encode content in isolated chunks during ingestion, losing
structural and cross-page dependencies, and retrieve a fixed number of pages at
inference, regardless of the specific demands of the question or context. This
often results in incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for
multi-page reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LAD-RAG, a
novel Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework. During ingestion, LAD-RAG constructs
a symbolic document graph that captures layout structure and cross-page
dependencies, adding it alongside standard neural embeddings to yield a more
holistic representation of the document. During inference, an LLM agent
dynamically interacts with the neural and symbolic indices to adaptively
retrieve the necessary evidence based on the query. Experiments on
MMLongBench-Doc, LongDocURL, DUDE, and MP-DocVQA demonstrate that LAD-RAG
improves retrieval, achieving over 90% perfect recall on average without any
top-k tuning, and outperforming baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at
comparable noise levels, yielding higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.

Title: When Benchmarks Age: Temporal Misalignment through Large Language Model
  Factuality Evaluation
Authors: Xunyi Jiang, Dingyi Chang, Julian McAuley, Xin Xu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) and the real world has
outpaced the static nature of widely used evaluation benchmarks, raising
concerns about their reliability for evaluating LLM factuality. While
substantial works continue to rely on the popular but old benchmarks, their
temporal misalignment with real-world facts and modern LLMs, and their effects
on LLM factuality evaluation remain underexplored. Therefore, in this work, we
present a systematic investigation of this issue by examining five popular
factuality benchmarks and eight LLMs released across different years. An
up-to-date fact retrieval pipeline and three metrics are tailored to quantify
benchmark aging and its impact on LLM factuality evaluation. Experimental
results and analysis illustrate that a considerable portion of samples in the
widely used factuality benchmarks are outdated, leading to unreliable
assessments of LLM factuality. We hope our work can provide a testbed to assess
the reliability of a benchmark for LLM factuality evaluation and inspire more
research on the benchmark aging issue. Codes are available in

  LoRA Experts
Authors: Christos Ziakas, Nicholas Loo, Nishita Jain, Alessandra Russo
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Automated red-teaming has emerged as a scalable approach for auditing Large
Language Models (LLMs) prior to deployment, yet existing approaches lack
mechanisms to efficiently adapt to model-specific vulnerabilities at inference.
We introduce Red-Bandit, a red-teaming framework that adapts online to identify
and exploit model failure modes under distinct attack styles (e.g.,
manipulation, slang). Red-Bandit post-trains a set of parameter-efficient LoRA
experts, each specialized for a particular attack style, using reinforcement
learning that rewards the generation of unsafe prompts via a rule-based safety
model. At inference, a multi-armed bandit policy dynamically selects among
these attack-style experts based on the target model's response safety,
balancing exploration and exploitation. Red-Bandit achieves state-of-the-art
results on AdvBench under sufficient exploration (ASR@10), while producing more
human-readable prompts (lower perplexity). Moreover, Red-Bandit's bandit policy
serves as a diagnostic tool for uncovering model-specific vulnerabilities by
indicating which attack styles most effectively elicit unsafe behaviors.

Comments: 20 pages
\\
  Post-training for reasoning of large language models (LLMs) increasingly
relies on verifiable rewards: deterministic checkers that provide 0-1
correctness signals. While reliable, such binary feedback is brittle--many
tasks admit partially correct or alternative answers that verifiers
under-credit, and the resulting all-or-nothing supervision limits learning.
Reward models offer richer, continuous feedback, which can serve as a
complementary supervisory signal to verifiers. We introduce HERO (Hybrid
Ensemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO
employs stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within
verifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality
distinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts
where dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines,
with strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks. Our results show
that hybrid reward design retains the stability of verifiers while leveraging
the nuance of reward models to advance reasoning.

  Evaluating large language model (LLM) outputs in the legal domain presents
unique challenges due to the complex and nuanced nature of legal analysis.
Current evaluation approaches either depend on reference data, which is costly
to produce, or use standardized assessment methods, both of which have
significant limitations for legal applications.
  Although LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a promising evaluation technique, its
reliability and effectiveness in legal contexts depend heavily on evaluation
processes unique to the legal industry and how trustworthy the evaluation
appears to the human legal expert. This is where existing evaluation methods
currently fail and exhibit considerable variability.
  This paper aims to close the gap: a) we break down lengthy responses into
'Legal Data Points' (LDPs), self-contained units of information, and introduce
a novel, reference-free evaluation methodology that reflects how lawyers
evaluate legal answers; b) we demonstrate that our method outperforms a variety
of baselines on both our proprietary dataset and an open-source dataset
(LegalBench); c) we show how our method correlates more closely with human
expert evaluations and helps improve inter-annotator agreement; and finally d)
we open source our Legal Data Points for a subset of LegalBench used in our
experiments, allowing the research community to replicate our results and
advance research in this vital area of LLM evaluation on legal
question-answering.

Title: Don't Adapt Small Language Models for Tools; Adapt Tool Schemas to the
  Models
Authors: Jonggeun Lee, Woojung Song, Jongwook Han, Haesung Pyun, Yohan Jo
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 15 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Small language models (SLMs) offer significant computational advantages for
tool-augmented AI systems, yet they struggle with tool-use tasks, particularly
in selecting appropriate tools and identifying correct parameters. A common
failure mode is schema misalignment: models hallucinate plausible but
non-existent tool names that reflect naming conventions internalized during
pretraining but absent from the provided tool schema. Rather than forcing
models to adapt to arbitrary schemas, we propose adapting schemas to align with
models' pretrained knowledge. We introduce PA-Tool (Pretraining-Aligned Tool
Schema Generation), a training-free method that leverages peakedness-a signal
from contamination detection indicating pretraining familiarity-to
automatically rename tool components. By generating multiple candidates and
selecting those with highest output concentration across samples, PA-Tool
identifies pretrain-aligned naming patterns. Experiments on MetaTool and
RoTBench show improvements of up to 17% points, with schema misalignment errors
reduced by 80%. PA-Tool enables small models to approach state-of-the-art
performance while maintaining computational efficiency for adaptation to new
tools without retraining. Our work demonstrates that schema-level interventions
can unlock the tool-use potential of resource-efficient models by adapting
schemas to models rather than models to schemas.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Rubrics provide a flexible way to train LLMs on open-ended long-form answers
where verifiable rewards are not applicable and human preferences provide
coarse signals. Prior work shows that reinforcement learning with rubric-based
rewards leads to consistent gains in LLM post-training. Most existing
approaches rely on rubrics that remain static over the course of training. Such
static rubrics, however, are vulnerable to reward-hacking type behaviors and
fail to capture emergent desiderata that arise during training. We introduce
Online Rubrics Elicitation (OnlineRubrics), a method that dynamically curates
evaluation criteria in an online manner through pairwise comparisons of
responses from current and reference policies. This online process enables
continuous identification and mitigation of errors as training proceeds.
Empirically, this approach yields consistent improvements of up to 8% over
training exclusively with static rubrics across AlpacaEval, GPQA, ArenaHard as
well as the validation sets of expert questions and rubrics. We qualitatively
analyze the elicited criteria and identify prominent themes such as
transparency, practicality, organization, and reasoning.

Comments: 19pages, 7 figures
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to improve their responses when
instructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When instructions
provide only a general and abstract goal without specific details about
potential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to
improve response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction.
The empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various
applications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. Focusing on
moral self-correction in LLMs, we reveal a key characteristic of intrinsic
self-correction: performance convergence through multi-round interactions; and
provide a mechanistic analysis of this convergence behavior. Based on our
experimental results and analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism of
convergence: consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moral
concepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as the
activated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds. This paper
demonstrates the strong potential of moral self-correction by showing that it
exhibits a desirable property of converged performance.

  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
reasoning tasks by adopting the "think-then-answer" paradigm, which enhances
both accuracy and interpretability. However, current LRMs exhibit two critical
limitations when processing non-English languages: (1) They often struggle to
maintain input-output language consistency; (2) They generally perform poorly
with wrong reasoning paths and lower answer accuracy compared to English. These
limitations significantly degrade the user experience for non-English speakers
and hinder the global deployment of LRMs. To address these limitations, we
propose M-Thinker, which is trained by the GRPO algorithm that involves a
Language Consistency (LC) reward and a novel Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment
(CTA) reward. Specifically, the LC reward defines a strict constraint on the
language consistency between the input, thought, and answer. Besides, the CTA
reward compares the model's non-English reasoning paths with its English
reasoning path to transfer its own reasoning capability from English to
non-English languages. Through an iterative RL procedure, our M-Thinker-1.5B/7B
models not only achieve nearly 100% language consistency and superior
performance on two multilingual benchmarks (MMATH and PolyMath), but also
exhibit excellent generalization on out-of-domain languages.

While recent LLMs have achieved strong performance in code generation, existing

temporal forecasting, and strategic recommendation, reflecting multi-level and
multi-step agentic intelligence. We find that LLM performance drops on
high-level questions, struggling to make accurate predictions and offer
actionable plans. Based on execution success rate, the CORGI benchmark is about
21\% more difficult than the BIRD benchmark. This highlights the gap between
popular LLMs and the need for real-world business intelligence. We release a
public dataset and evaluation framework, and a website for public submissions.

Title: Vibe Checker: Aligning Code Evaluation with Human Preference

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed vibe coding, where users leverage
LLMs to generate and iteratively refine code through natural language
interactions until it passes their vibe check. Vibe check is tied to real-world
human preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right,
read cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code
evaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness,
overlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this
paper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece
underlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides
functional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following
capabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30
verifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic
verifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites,
resulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following
and functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even
the strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit
clear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional
correctness and instruction following correlates the best with human
preference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on
real-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe
check, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that
better align with user preferences in coding.

Title: Artificial Hippocampus Networks for Efficient Long-Context Modeling
Authors: Yunhao Fang, Weihao Yu, Shu Zhong, Qinghao Ye, Xuehan Xiong, Lai Wei
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Code: https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/AHN
\\
  Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency
of compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of
lossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the
Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of
artificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the
Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module
termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses
out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To
validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like
architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive
experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate
that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and
achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while
substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance,
augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5%
and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k
sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88. Code is available at:

  In the field of railway automation, one of the key challenges has been the
development of effective computer vision systems due to the limited
availability of high-quality, sequential data. Traditional datasets are
restricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for
real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related
to realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually
relevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more
closely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone
determination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that
simplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized
recognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision
points along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical
framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments,
facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway
automation.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating highly structured texts. However, while exhibiting a high degree of
structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced
storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs
often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated
CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup
Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed,
high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the
content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity
and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three
pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character
Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we
propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions.
CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written
scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated
by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a
prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event
logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound
scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and
demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality
screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.

Title: User to Video: A Model for Spammer Detection Inspired by Video
  Classification Technology
Authors: Haoyang Zhang, Zhou Yang, Yucai Pang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)
  2025
\\
  This article is inspired by video classification technology. If the user
behavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are
viewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection
based on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl
algorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial
behavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is
quantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed
for transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense
vectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation
learning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the
frame imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on
temporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined
to identify the spammers. Experiments using publicly available datasets, i.e.,
WEIBO and TWITTER, show an advantage of the UVSD model over state-of-the-art
methods.

\\
  Detecting surface landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) using deep
learning has shown promise in humanitarian demining. However, deterministic
neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks,
leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the
idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated
into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO
classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC
Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional
metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed
decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially
perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag
unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept
study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises
awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to
adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust
and reliable models for practical applications.

coronary models: intravascular imaging gives sub-millimetre resolution but
limited whole-vessel context, while CCTA supplies 3D geometry but suffers from

Title: Does Physics Knowledge Emerge in Frontier Models?
Authors: Ieva Bagdonaviciute, Vibhav Vineet
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures. Preprint
\\
  Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong results in visual
perception and general reasoning, but their ability to understand and predict
physical dynamics remains unclear. We benchmark six frontier VLMs on three
physical simulation datasets - CLEVRER, Physion, and Physion++ - where the
evaluation tasks test whether a model can predict outcomes or hypothesize about
alternative situations. To probe deeper, we design diagnostic subtests that
isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion
prediction, spatial relations). Intuitively, stronger diagnostic performance
should support higher evaluation accuracy. Yet our analysis reveals weak
correlations: models that excel at perception or physics reasoning do not
consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual evaluation. This
counterintuitive gap exposes a central limitation of current VLMs: perceptual
and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal
understanding, underscoring the need for architectures that bind perception and
reasoning more tightly.

Title: Enhanced Self-Distillation Framework for Efficient Spiking Neural
  Network Training
Authors: Xiaochen Zhao, Chengting Yu, Kairong Yu, Lei Liu, Aili Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency on
neuromorphic hardware due to their sparse activation patterns. However,
conventional training methods based on surrogate gradients and Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) not only lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in
performance, but also incur significant computational and memory overheads that
grow linearly with the temporal dimension. To enable high-performance SNN
training under limited computational resources, we propose an enhanced
self-distillation framework, jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation.
Specifically, the firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto
lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality knowledge generated by the model
itself is used to optimize substructures through the ANN pathways. Unlike
traditional self-distillation paradigms, we observe that low-quality
self-generated knowledge may hinder convergence. To address this, we decouple
the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components, ensuring that only
reliable knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the model. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that
our method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN
training. Our code is available at

Title: Ensemble Deep Learning and LLM-Assisted Reporting for Automated Skin
  Lesion Diagnosis
Authors: Sher Khan, Raz Muhammad, Adil Hussain, Muhammad Sajjad, Muhammad
  Rashid
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet
current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access
disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are
limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and
fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate
post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We
introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for
dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a
purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional
neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an
intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review
-- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model
capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification
outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill
medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This
seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion
characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring
guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between
visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers
within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical
translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving
clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward
deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively
supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient
education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

  Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of
gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise
events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two
additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective
classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing
classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer
(ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset
with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a
classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision
Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by
effectively distinguishing transient noise.

  Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) allows agents to learn diverse
objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL, however, is contingent
on the choice of goal representation. In this work, we propose a mask-based
goal representation system that provides object-agnostic visual cues to the
agent, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization. In contrast,
existing goal representation methods, such as target state images, 3D
coordinates, and one-hot vectors, face issues of poor generalization to unseen
objects, slow convergence, and the need for special cameras. Masks can be
processed to generate dense rewards without requiring error-prone distance
calculations. Learning with ground truth masks in simulation, we achieved 99.9%
reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects. Our proposed method can
be utilized to perform pick-up tasks with high accuracy, without using any
positional information of the target. Moreover, we demonstrate learning from
scratch and sim-to-real transfer applications using two different physical
robots, utilizing pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask
generation.

Title: Improving the Spatial Resolution of GONG Solar Images to GST Quality
  Using Deep Learning
Authors: Chenyang Li, Qin Li, Haimin Wang, Bo Shen
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 5 pages; accepted as a workshop paper in ICDM 2025
\\
  High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale
dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution
of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these
small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution
approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR
observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope
(BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a
relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model
effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine
details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE)
of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC)
of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative
performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset
expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

Title: ChainMPQ: Interleaved Text-Image Reasoning Chains for Mitigating
  Relation Hallucinations
Authors: Yike Wu, Yiwei Wang, Yujun Cai
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in
multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among
the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and
relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have
received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ
(Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a
training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing
accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and
object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions.
It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core
components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that
links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual
and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for
subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that
guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and
benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations,
while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core
modules.

Comments: Preprint. Under review
\\
  High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly
important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing
face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when
deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high
resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage.
MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a
standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent
projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited
image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling.
Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only
improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over
existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g.,
up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g.,
a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of
MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution
image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

Comments: Master Thesis with 125 pages, 59 figures, 17 tables
\\
  Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking
system using RGBD images that contain both color (RGB) and depth (D)
information. To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on
the Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and
Transformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore,
a new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either
do not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point
Estimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various
model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three
different datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time
pipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in
front of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is
based on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head
pose features. Lian et al. achieve a mean Euclidean error of 38.7mm on their
own dataset ShanghaiTechGaze+. In this thesis, a model architecture with a
Transformer module for feature fusion achieves a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm
on the same dataset, but we show that using no pre-trained GAN module leads to
a mean Euclidean error of 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) improves the error to 26.9mm. These results are
coherent with the ones on the other two datasets. On the ETH-XGaze dataset, the
model with Transformer module achieves a mean angular error of 3.59{\deg} and
without Transformer module 3.26{\deg}, whereas the fundamentally different
model architecture used by the dataset authors Zhang et al. achieves a mean
angular error of 2.04{\deg}. On the OTH-Gaze-Estimation dataset created for...

Title: Scalable deep fusion of spaceborne lidar and synthetic aperture radar
  for global forest structural complexity mapping
Authors: Tiago de Conto, John Armston, Ralph Dubayah
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.AP
\\
  Forest structural complexity metrics integrate multiple canopy attributes
into a single value that reflects habitat quality and ecosystem function.
Spaceborne lidar from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) has
enabled mapping of structural complexity in temperate and tropical forests, but
its sparse sampling limits continuous high-resolution mapping. We present a
scalable, deep learning framework fusing GEDI observations with multimodal
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets to produce global, high-resolution (25
m) wall-to-wall maps of forest structural complexity. Our adapted
EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on over 130 million GEDI footprints,
achieves high performance (global R2 = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000
parameters, making it an accessible tool that enables researchers to process
datasets at any scale without requiring specialized computing infrastructure.
The model produces accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty estimates
across biomes and time periods, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns. It has
been used to generate a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural
complexity from 2015 to 2022. Through transfer learning, this framework can be
extended to predict additional forest structural variables with minimal
computational cost. This approach supports continuous, multi-temporal
monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for
biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management efforts in a changing
climate.

broad spectrum of multi-modal tasks, including text-to-image generation,
image-to-image generation (e.g., image editing, subject-driven generation, and
image inpainting, etc.), as well as image understanding. Lumina-DiMOO achieves

Title: TransFIRA: Transfer Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment

  Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video,
and web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur,
illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to
predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing
FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or
computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions
detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer
Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and
annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding
space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability
via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),
yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering
and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that
achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly
doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,
heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond
faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations
and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first
recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm
state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and
robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish
TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability
assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across
modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and
scope.

  The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network of
roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to
observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on
roads and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary
for making critical operational decisions during winter weather events.
However, machine learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT
by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. In this
study, convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on camera
images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained
on a hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human
labelers into one of six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry,
poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet
the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, and the weather-related
road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on
completely unseen cameras.

Title: TDiff: Thermal Plug-And-Play Prior with Patch-Based Diffusion

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Thermal images from low-cost cameras often suffer from low resolution, fixed
pattern noise, and other localized degradations. Available datasets for thermal
imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages
the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In
this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping
patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge,
this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior
for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising,
super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated
and real thermal data, establishing our method as a unified restoration
pipeline.

  We present SIGMA-GEN, a unified framework for multi-identity preserving image
generation. Unlike prior approaches, SIGMA-GEN is the first to enable
single-pass multi-subject identity-preserved generation guided by both
structural and spatial constraints. A key strength of our method is its ability
to support user guidance at various levels of precision -- from coarse 2D or 3D
boxes to pixel-level segmentations and depth -- with a single model. To enable
this, we introduce SIGMA-SET27K, a novel synthetic dataset that provides
identity, structure, and spatial information for over 100k unique subjects
across 27k images. Through extensive evaluation we demonstrate that SIGMA-GEN
achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation, image
generation quality, and speed. Code and visualizations at

Title: Superpixel Integrated Grids for Fast Image Segmentation
Authors: Jack Roberts, Jeova Farias Sales Rocha Neto
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Superpixels have long been used in image simplification to enable more
efficient data processing and storage. However, despite their computational
potential, their irregular spatial distribution has often forced deep learning
approaches to rely on specialized training algorithms and architectures,
undermining the original motivation for superpixelations. In this work, we
introduce a new superpixel-based data structure, SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated
Grid), as an alternative to full-resolution images in segmentation tasks. By
leveraging classical shape descriptors, SIGRID encodes both color and shape
information of superpixels while substantially reducing input dimensionality.
We evaluate SIGRIDs on four benchmark datasets using two popular convolutional
segmentation architectures. Our results show that, despite compressing the
original data, SIGRIDs not only match but in some cases surpass the performance
of pixel-level representations, all while significantly accelerating model
training. This demonstrates that SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between
accuracy and computational efficiency.

Title: Text2Interact: High-Fidelity and Diverse Text-to-Two-Person Interaction
  Generation
Authors: Qingxuan Wu, Zhiyang Dou, Chuan Guo, Yiming Huang, Qiao Feng, Bing

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Modeling human-human interactions from text remains challenging because it
requires not only realistic individual dynamics but also precise,
text-consistent spatiotemporal coupling between agents. Currently, progress is
hindered by 1) limited two-person training data, inadequate to capture the
diverse intricacies of two-person interactions; and 2) insufficiently
fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling, where language conditioning
collapses rich, structured prompts into a single sentence embedding. To address
these limitations, we propose our Text2Interact framework, designed to generate
realistic, text-aligned human-human interactions through a scalable
high-fidelity interaction data synthesizer and an effective spatiotemporal
coordination pipeline. First, we present InterCompose, a scalable
synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction
descriptions with strong single-person motion priors. Given a prompt and a
motion for an agent, InterCompose retrieves candidate single-person motions,
trains a conditional reaction generator for another agent, and uses a neural
motion evaluator to filter weak or misaligned samples-expanding interaction
coverage without extra capture. Second, we propose InterActor, a
text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves
token-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and an adaptive
interaction loss that emphasizes contextually relevant inter-person joint
pairs, improving coupling and physical plausibility for fine-grained
interaction modeling. Extensive experiments show consistent gains in motion
diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution
scenarios and user studies. We will release code and models to facilitate
reproducibility.

Title: From Captions to Keyframes: Efficient Video Summarization via Caption-
  and Context-Aware Frame Scoring
Authors: Shih-Yao Lin and Sibendu Paul and Caren Chen
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of
frames that retain semantic and contextual information from long videos. We
propose KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework that jointly leverages
captions and visual context to estimate frame-level importance. By combining
semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, KeyScore
identifies the most informative frames for downstream tasks such as retrieval,
captioning, and video-language reasoning. To complement KeyScore, we introduce
STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering for Frame Proposals), which
generates compact and diverse frame candidates for long-form videos. Together,
these modules achieve up to 99\% frame reduction compared to full-frame
inference and substantially outperform standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT,
MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results demonstrate that emphasizing multimodal alignment
between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and
caption-grounded video understanding -- without explicit video summarization.

Title: LogSTOP: Temporal Scores over Prediction Sequences for Matching and
  Retrieval
Authors: Avishree Khare, Hideki Okamoto, Bardh Hoxha, Georgios Fainekos, Rajeev
  Alur
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties
such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos
and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated
by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences
can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g.,
"does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked
retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is
detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this
problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences,
given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose
a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for
temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP,
with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and
other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with
temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively.
Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and
actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a
19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot
text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.

  Diffusion

Comments: 10 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Limited-angle electron tomography aims to reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D
projections of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) within a restricted range
and number of tilting angles, but it suffers from the missing-wedge problem
that causes severe reconstruction artifacts. Deep learning approaches have
shown promising results in alleviating these artifacts, yet they typically
require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth which
are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy. To address these challenges, we
propose TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework.
Our method is trained on readily available volumetric FIB-SEM data using a
simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling the model to learn
realistic structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. By
operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff implicitly enforces consistency
across slices without the need for additional regularization. On simulated
electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage, TEMDiff outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality. We further demonstrate that
a trained TEMDiff model generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts obtained under
different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as
narrow as 8 degrees, with 2-degree increments, without any retraining or
fine-tuning.

Title: VUGEN: Visual Understanding priors for GENeration
Authors: Xiangyi Chen, Th\'eophane Vallaeys, Maha Elbayad, John Nguyen, Jakob
  Verbeek
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified
understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust
image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often
rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms,
leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations,
or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework
that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for
efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the
high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a
lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual
information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent
space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally,
a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space.
We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than
commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE
latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image
generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from
11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding
capabilities.

Title: Cluster Paths: Navigating Interpretability in Neural Networks
Authors: Nicholas M. Kroeger and Vincent Bindschaedler
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision
tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted
trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a
post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers
and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these
cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),
weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness
(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a
spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts
and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task,
they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise
without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on
ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a
large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster
paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably
flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident
predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes,
textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that
cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and
human-readable explanations.

Title: HSNet: Heterogeneous Subgraph Network for Single Image Super-resolution
Authors: Qiongyang Hu, Wenyang Liu, Wenbin Zou, Yuejiao Su, Lap-Pui Chau, Yi
  Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly
those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural
inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational
adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational
complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the
Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently
leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core
idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.
First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates
a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single
monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by
modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a
rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the
Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across
these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,
SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures
intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is
designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing
accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively
balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will
be made publicly available.

Title: Through the Perspective of LiDAR: A Feature-Enriched and
  Uncertainty-Aware Annotation Pipeline for Terrestrial Point Cloud
  Segmentation
Authors: Fei Zhang, Rob Chancia, Josie Clapp, Amirhossein Hassanzadeh, Dimah
  Dera, Richard MacKenzie, Jan van Aardt
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point
clouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated,
uncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature
enrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling
effort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D
spherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an
ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty
maps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are
back-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a
three-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and
compact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this
pipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove
forests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address
two key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which
features matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12
annotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact
nine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm
the generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset
tests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.
  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation
pipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii)
empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling
scalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological
monitoring and beyond. The dataset and processing scripts are publicly

Title: Improving Artifact Robustness for CT Deep Learning Models Without
  Labeled Artifact Images via Domain Adaptation
Authors: Justin Cheung, Samuel Savine, Calvin Nguyen, Lin Lu, Alhassan S. Yasin
Categories: cs.CV q-bio.TO
Comments: 8 pages, 12 figures, 1 table
\\
  Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training
distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a
CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the
model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design
features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate
artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images
from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,
this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that
maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without
corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in
sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against
baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT
dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean
images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional
augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen
artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high
classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact
data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for
artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification
performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained
with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to
uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation
can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring
expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for
deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.

\\
  Visual tokenization remains a core challenge in unifying visual understanding
and generation within the autoregressive paradigm. Existing methods typically
employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large
language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic
expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To
address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a
continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and
understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional
features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile
these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture
involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.
Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual
representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single
autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and
generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly
supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,
generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous
visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers
by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art
level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate
unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model
weights are released to benefit community.

\\
  Deep learning advances have revolutionized automated digital pathology
analysis. However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can
introduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color
inconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired
under different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain
shift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color
normalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing
artifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To
address these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model
that can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as
object detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging
process per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via
algorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to
extract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology
images, which serves as input for further processing. Experimentally, we
evaluate the method on publicly available pathology datasets and an internally
curated collection of malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection
and classification, where our method outperforms many state-of-the-art stain
normalization methods. Our code is available at

\\
  The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data.
The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant
challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated
through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution,
enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and
resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data
requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset
Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without
requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient
generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in
resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM
demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores
of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only
exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable
insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly
iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for
evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at

methodologies to achieve high performance across different camera models.
Winners are determined based on a combination of performance metrics, including
full-reference measures (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), and non-reference ones (ARNIQA,
TOPIQ). By pushing the boundaries of camera-agnostic low-light RAW image
denoising trained on synthetic data, the competition promotes the development

Title: Self-supervised Physics-guided Model with Implicit Representation
  Regularization for Fast MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Jingran Xu, Yuanyuan Liu, and Yanjie Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its
widespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI
reconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by
reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In
recent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress
in this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches
proving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are
difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised
reconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI
reconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a
physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively
constrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the
powerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's
interpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental
results demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR
achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised
learning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.

Title: A Bridge from Audio to Video: Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Allows Every Face
  to Speak Multiple Languages
Authors: Zibo Su, Kun Wei, Jiahua Li, Xu Yang, Cheng Deng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) focuses on generating lifelike
facial animations from audio input. Current TFS models perform well in English
but unsatisfactorily in non-English languages, producing wrong mouth shapes and
rigid facial expressions. The terrible performance is caused by the
English-dominated training datasets and the lack of cross-language
generalization abilities. Thus, we propose Multilingual Experts (MuEx), a novel
framework featuring a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture
that employs phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio
and video modalities, achieving lifelike multilingual TFS. To alleviate the
influence of linguistic differences and dataset bias, we extract audio and
video features as phonemes and visemes respectively, which are the basic units
of speech sounds and mouth movements. To address audiovisual synchronization
issues, we introduce the Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), which
establishes robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes. In
addition, we build a Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) comprising 12
diverse languages with 95.04 hours of high-quality videos for training and
evaluating multilingual TFS performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits
effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional
training.

Title: MSITrack: A Challenging Benchmark for Multispectral Single Object
  Tracking
Authors: Tao Feng, Tingfa Xu, Haolin Qin, Tianhao Li, Shuaihao Han, Xuyang Zou,
  Zhan Lv and Jianan Li
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Visual object tracking in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges
including occlusion, interference from similar objects and complex
backgrounds-all of which limit the effectiveness of RGB-based trackers.
Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance,
enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral
tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack,
the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to
date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging
Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color
and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a
wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural
Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack
far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and
categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first
time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of
multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone
meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive
evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral
data in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines,
highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field. The
MSITrack dataset is publicly available at:

Title: StaR-KVQA: Structured Reasoning Traces for Implicit-Knowledge Visual
  Question Answering
Authors: Zhihao Wen, Wenkang Wei, Yuan Fang, Xingtong Yu, Hui Zhang, Weicheng
  Zhu, Xin Zhang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground
entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. We study its
implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs
lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications,
and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present
StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises
structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded
natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and
verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects
path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then
fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with
supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases
(KBs) are used, traces are built offline, and inference is a single
autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and
interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over
the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

Title: Automated Neural Architecture Design for Industrial Defect Detection
Authors: Yuxi Liu, Yunfeng Ma, Yi Tang, Min Liu, Shuai Jiang, and Yaonan Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product
quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of
surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and
interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed
models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address
both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated
neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over
convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design
enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range
semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of
manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search
space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates
supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a
searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to
enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime
efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD
incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient
architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial
defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection
platform. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yuxi104/AutoNAD.

Authors: Yongxin Zhu, Jiawei Chen, Yuanzhe Chen, Zhuo Chen, Dongya Jia, Jian
  Cong, Xiaobin Zhuang, Yuping Wang, Yuxuan Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  We introduce Heptapod, an image autoregressive model that adheres to the
foundational principles of language modeling. Heptapod employs \textbf{causal
attention}, \textbf{eliminates reliance on CFG}, and \textbf{eschews the trend
of semantic tokenizers}. Our key innovation is \textit{next 2D distribution
prediction}: a causal Transformer with reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer,
learns to predict the distribution over the entire 2D spatial grid of images at
each timestep. This learning objective unifies the sequential modeling of
autoregressive framework with the holistic self-supervised learning of masked
autoencoding, enabling the model to capture comprehensive image semantics via
generative training. On the ImageNet generation benchmark, Heptapod achieves an
FID of $2.70$, significantly outperforming previous causal autoregressive
approaches. We hope our work inspires a principled rethinking of language
modeling on visual signals and beyond.

\\
  Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven
generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face
limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies
solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing
details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven
generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking
broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel
tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support
both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete
and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We
introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model
framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1)
using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and
concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training
data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the
extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based
editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index
encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish
images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training
with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex
instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these
two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has
achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

Title: Semantic Segmentation Algorithm Based on Light Field and LiDAR Fusion
Authors: Jie Luo, Yuxuan Jiang, Xin Jin, Mingyu Liu, Yihui Fan
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in
autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex
conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide
complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust
perception; how- ever, their effective integration is hindered by limited
viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these
challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating
light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we
proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation
network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to
segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature
completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image
pixels by performing differential re- construction of point-cloud feature maps,
enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves
the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better
occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image- only segmentation by 1.71
Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38
mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.

  Novel View Synthesis
Authors: Jipeng Lyu, Jiahua Dong, Yu-Xiong Wang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (06/2025)
\\
  Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations
while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded
optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian
Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations
often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar
transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level
to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time
frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only
one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates
effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view
synthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.

  Digital humanities scholars increasingly use Large Language Models for
historical document digitization, yet lack appropriate evaluation frameworks
for LLM-based OCR. Traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and
period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation. We present an
evaluation methodology for LLM-based historical OCR, addressing contamination
risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription. Using 18th-century
Russian Civil font texts, we introduce novel metrics including Historical
Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), alongside
protocols for contamination control and stability testing. We evaluate 12
multimodal LLMs, finding that Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR
while exhibiting over-historicization: inserting archaic characters from
incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves
performance. Our methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with
guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus
digitization.

Title: DeRainMamba: A Frequency-Aware State Space Model with Detail Enhancement
  for Image Deraining
Authors: Zhiliang Zhu, Tao Zeng, Tao Yang, Guoliang Luo and Jiyong Zeng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: accepted by IEEE SPL
\\
  Image deraining is crucial for improving visual quality and supporting
reliable downstream vision tasks. Although Mamba-based models provide efficient
sequence modeling, their limited ability to capture fine-grained details and
lack of frequency-domain awareness restrict further improvements. To address
these issues, we propose DeRainMamba, which integrates a Frequency-Aware
State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution
(MDPConv). FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from
high-frequency image details, balancing rain removal and detail preservation.
MDPConv further restores local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient
features and efficiently fusing multiple convolution branches. Extensive
experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that DeRainMamba consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while requiring fewer
parameters and lower computational costs. These results validate the
effectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail
enhancement within a state-space framework for single image deraining.

Title: OBS-Diff: Accurate Pruning For Diffusion Models in One-Shot
Authors: Junhan Zhu, Hesong Wang, Mingluo Su, Zefang Wang, Huan Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from
prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can
hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of
diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel
one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression
of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff
revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex
architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning
granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA
heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the
iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an
error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian
construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme,
assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error
accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise
sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration
process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with
minimal degradation in visual quality.

Title: Transforming Noise Distributions with Histogram Matching: Towards a
  Single Denoiser for All
Authors: Sheng Fu, Junchao Zhang, Kailun Yang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages
\\
  Supervised Gaussian denoisers exhibit limited generalization when confronted
with out-of-distribution noise, due to the diverse distributional
characteristics of different noise types. To bridge this gap, we propose a
histogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target
Gaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing
cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising.
This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it
approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect
and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise
complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise,
intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain
histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial
correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser
gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises,
including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating
pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of our method.

  The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in
high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In
this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on
existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the
problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,
Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived
land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning
(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and
predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the
actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct
supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to
link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the
low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the
former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in
the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the
presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels
can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution
labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a
Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020
IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework compared to standard training strategies.

\\
  Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning
typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that
contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work,
we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model
on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data.
Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework
by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while
inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to
control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the
model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our
approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual
question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%,
respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16
datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B
surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining
highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning
can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many
interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely
data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly
chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up
to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

Title: Extreme Amodal Face Detection

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects
that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an
expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is
partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we
consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides
motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our
method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences
so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make
use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we
consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free
approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the
presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object
detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the
out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine
decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even
outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

\\
  Echocardiography is a critical tool for detecting heart diseases. Recently,
ultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high
operational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly
skilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination
services. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by
foundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is
designed to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior
sonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by
the practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past
explorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action
Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode
vision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in
sequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a
pre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment
strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance
models. Our code will be released after acceptance.

Title: Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoders for Large Scale Vision-Language
  Reranking
Authors: Mitchell Keren Taraday, Shahaf Wagner, Chaim Baskin
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: preprint
\\
  Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast
vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval,
where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language
rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP
are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage,
preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we
introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes
vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based
adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set
of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance
while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput
inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while
requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr
(zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints
will be made publicly available shortly.

Title: StyleKeeper: Prevent Content Leakage using Negative Visual Query
  Guidance
Authors: Jaeseok Jeong, Junho Kim, Gayoung Lee, Yunjey Choi, and Youngjung Uh

Comments: Accepted to ICCV 2025; CVPRW AI4CC 2024 (Best Paper + Oral)
\\
  In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as
powerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as
prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However,
existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of
the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To
address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize
swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to
reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by
intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of
key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple
yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we

Title: Lattice-allocated Real-time Line Segment Feature Detection and Tracking
  Using Only an Event-based Camera

  Line segment extraction is effective for capturing geometric features of
human-made environments. Event-based cameras, which asynchronously respond to
contrast changes along edges, enable efficient extraction by reducing redundant
data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or
struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment
detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event
rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i)
velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a
fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints.
Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates
real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines, enabling fully stand-alone event
camera operation in real-world settings.

Title: Continual Action Quality Assessment via Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph
  Regularization

  Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantifies human actions in videos,
supporting applications in sports scoring, rehabilitation, and skill
evaluation. A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality
distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability
of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA
with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image
classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical
analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is
necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT
induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting.
To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization
(MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers
while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a
manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current
representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global
distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with
tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic
cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline
and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and
effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/MAGRPP.

Title: Online Generic Event Boundary Detection
Authors: Hyungrok Jung, Daneul Kim, Seunggyun Lim, Jeany Son, Jonghyun Choi
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: ICCV 2025
\\
  Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to interpret long-form videos
through the lens of human perception. However, current GEBD methods require
processing complete video frames to make predictions, unlike humans processing
data online and in real-time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task,
Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), aiming to detect boundaries
of generic events immediately in streaming videos. This task faces unique
challenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time,
without the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST)
which explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging
the discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework
consists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the
Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD). Specifically, the CEA generates a
prediction of the future frame reflecting current event dynamics based solely
on prior frames. Then, the OBD measures the prediction error and adaptively
adjusts the threshold using statistical tests on past errors to capture
diverse, subtle event transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that
Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video
understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD
methods on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

  With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing
directly onboard satellites is becoming feasible. However, new constraints
arise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed
ground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed
sensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study
investigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for
object detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow
to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling
systemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are
trained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using
standard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that
while both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the
model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high
confidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved
contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving
onboard AI for remote sensing.

Title: HARP-NeXt: High-Speed and Accurate Range-Point Fusion Network for 3D
  LiDAR Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Samir Abou Haidar, Alexandre Chariot, Mehdi Darouich, Cyril Joly and

  Intelligent Robots and Systems)
\\
  LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile
robots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on
resource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often
face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse
convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of
neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but
lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally,
many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve
performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing
phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded
platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR
semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing
methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design
the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture
representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a
multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple
abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing
accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that
HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all
state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is
comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\times$ faster. The code is

\\
  Lung infections, particularly pneumonia, pose serious health risks that can
escalate rapidly, especially during pandemics. Accurate AI-based severity
prediction from medical imaging is essential to support timely clinical
decisions and optimize patient outcomes. In this work, we present a novel
method applicable to both CT scans and chest X-rays for assessing lung
infection severity. Our contributions are twofold: (i) QCross-Att-PVT, a
Transformer-based architecture that integrates parallel encoders, a cross-gated
attention mechanism, and a feature aggregator to capture rich multi-scale
features; and (ii) Conditional Online TransMix, a custom data augmentation
strategy designed to address dataset imbalance by generating mixed-label image
patches during training. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, RALO CXR and
Per-COVID-19 CT, our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art
deep learning models. The results emphasize the critical role of data
augmentation and gated attention in improving both robustness and predictive
accuracy. This approach offers a reliable, adaptable tool to support clinical
diagnosis, disease monitoring, and personalized treatment planning. The source

Title: Label-frugal satellite image change detection with generative virtual
  exemplar learning
Authors: Hichem Sahbi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding
all the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images.
The success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is
tributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the
acquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this
paper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning.
The main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how
important is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most
critical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling.
These exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the
optimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity
and ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current
change detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the
positive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative
methods.

Title: IAR2: Improving Autoregressive Visual Generation with Semantic-Detail
  Associated Token Prediction
Authors: Ran Yi, Teng Hu, Zihan Su, Lizhuang Ma
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual content
creation, but often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of visual
data. Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by
reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby
improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of
pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive
framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the
core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which
decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic
information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the
quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly
enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a
Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context
Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the
semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window
to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we
introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that
dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance
to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence,
improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for
autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model
not only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates
superior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our
structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.

Title: OBJVanish: Physically Realizable Text-to-3D Adv. Generation of
  LiDAR-Invisible Objects
Authors: Bing Li, Wuqi Wang, Yanan Zhang, Jingzheng Li, Haigen Min, Wei Feng,
  Xingyu Zhao, Jie Zhang, Qing Guo
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where
failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D
adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems
and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However,
existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have
two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and
prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the
text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically
realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to
LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we
present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors
influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity,
and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with
multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the
insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation
(Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively
refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To
ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool
containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate
3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six
state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and
physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical
applications.

Title: Generating Surface for Text-to-3D using 2D Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Huanning Dong, Fan Li, Ping Kuang, Jianwen Min
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential
for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of
objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task.
Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or
train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper,
we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the
surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize
conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered
by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For
multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates
curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of
achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

Title: Learning Global Representation from Queries for Vectorized HD Map
  Construction
Authors: Shoumeng Qiu, Xinrun Li, Yang Long, Xiangyang Xue, Varun Ojha, Jian Pu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 16 pages
\\
  The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a
cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches,
particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance
detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object
queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the
inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD
\textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a
global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic
modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the
distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a
carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation
Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit,
global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations
on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach,
demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared
to leading baselines.

Title: Addressing the ID-Matching Challenge in Long Video Captioning
Authors: Zhantao Yang, Huangji Wang, Ruili Feng, Han Zhang, Yuting Hu, Shangwen
  Zhu, Junyan Li, Yu Liu, Fan Cheng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and
challenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of
text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in
long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear
in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior
works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer
from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits
their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we
build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the
inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the
ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new
benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using
this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights
that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)
enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of
information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a
novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning
Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption
quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision
of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%
to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track
different individuals in the captions of long videos.

Title: No MoCap Needed: Post-Training Motion Diffusion Models with
  Reinforcement Learning using Only Textual Prompts
Authors: Girolamo Macaluso, Lorenzo Mandelli, Mirko Bicchierai, Stefano
  Berretti and Andrew D. Bagdanov
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Diffusion models have recently advanced human motion generation, producing
realistic and diverse animations from textual prompts. However, adapting these
models to unseen actions or styles typically requires additional motion capture
data and full retraining, which is costly and difficult to scale. We propose a
post-training framework based on Reinforcement Learning that fine-tunes
pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without
requiring any motion ground truth. Our approach employs a pretrained
text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion
policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, effectively shifting the
model's generative distribution toward the target domain without relying on
paired motion data. We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and
leave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across
both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures. Results from quantitative
metrics and user studies show that our approach consistently improves the
quality and diversity of generated motions, while preserving performance on the
original distribution. Our approach is a flexible, data-efficient, and
privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation.

  The temporal consistency of yearly land-cover maps is of great importance to
model the evolution and change of the land cover over the years. In this paper,
we focus the attention on a novel approach to classification of yearly
satellite image time series (SITS) that combines deep learning with Bayesian
modelling, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer
Encoder (TE) based DNNs. The proposed approach aims to capture both i)
intricate temporal correlations in yearly SITS and ii) specific patterns in
multiyear crop type sequences. It leverages the cascade classification of an
HMM layer built on top of the TE, discerning consistent yearly crop-type
sequences. Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning
47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions demonstrates the
importance of modelling temporal consistency in the predicted labels. HMMs
enhance the overall performance and F1 scores, emphasising the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

  Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical
image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped
variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive
benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely
because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of
efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we
present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that
evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates
models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot
generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,
U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering
a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis
and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale
evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and
architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most
suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We
provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to
reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,
U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a
foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the
next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models. The project can be accessed at:

  A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input
image, this paper seeks to retrieve other images that share its central
concepts, capturing aspects of the underlying narrative. This goes beyond
conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or
semantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements,
and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach
grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding
space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors
necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this
neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure
that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human

or complex scenes with varying depth planes, DADO employs dynamic weighting to
adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on the global
characteristics of each image. We evaluated DADO on standard benchmarks, where
it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object discovery accuracy and
robustness without the need for fine-tuning.

Title: Enhancing Concept Localization in CLIP-based Concept Bottleneck Models
Authors: R\'emi Kazmierczak, Steve Azzolin, Elo\"ise Berthier, Goran Frehse,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This paper addresses explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that do not require explicit concept annotations,
relying instead on concepts extracted using CLIP in a zero-shot manner. We show
that CLIP, which is central in these techniques, is prone to concept
hallucination, incorrectly predicting the presence or absence of concepts
within an image in scenarios used in numerous CBMs, hence undermining the
faithfulness of explanations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Concept
Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI), a technique
that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target

Title: MoRe: Monocular Geometry Refinement via Graph Optimization for
  Cross-View Consistency
Authors: Dongki Jung, Jaehoon Choi, Yonghan Lee, Sungmin Eum, Heesung Kwon,
  Dinesh Manocha
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Monocular 3D foundation models offer an extensible solution for perception
tasks, making them attractive for broader 3D vision applications. In this
paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method
designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To
induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between
frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares
optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization
framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D
points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This
formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric
priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate
that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view
synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

Title: Validation of Various Normalization Methods for Brain Tumor
  Segmentation: Can Federated Learning Overcome This Heterogeneity?
Authors: Jan Fiszer and Dominika Ciupek and Maciej Malawski
Categories: cs.CV cs.DC
DOI: 10.1007/978-3-032-05663-4_12
\\
  Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however,
it requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data
privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm
that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when
dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This
study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity
normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of
heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for
brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of
the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training
and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to
inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of
92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These
results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing
models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical
applications. The code is available at:

Title: Graph Conditioned Diffusion for Controllable Histopathology Image
  Generation

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new
standards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains
challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical
images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape
or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs
operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors,
making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To
address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for
Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding
to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features
and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer
module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning
mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this
approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our
generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream
segmentation tasks. The code is available here.

Title: Few-Shot Adaptation Benchmark for Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable
potential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot
performance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data
regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this
work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot
adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten
remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used
few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying
backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance
can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some
RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The
variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing
methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for
few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a
reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically
evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions. The source code is publicly

  Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness
of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on
established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after
compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the
perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate
compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token
compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals
that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced
compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive
experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are
noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to
serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual
token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an
evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise
existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of
visual token compression methods. All data and code are available at

  Recent breakthroughs in video generation, powered by large-scale datasets and
diffusion techniques, have shown that video diffusion models can function as
implicit 4D novel view synthesizers. Nevertheless, current methods primarily
concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while
struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on
human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for
creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To
achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset
and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the
camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which
effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To
maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view
human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference
video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a
robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates
the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art
effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel
view synthesis.

Title: Resolution scaling governs DINOv3 transfer performance in chest
  radiograph classification
Authors: Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh, Mina Shaigan, Christiane Kuhl, Jakob Nikolas

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning,
but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with
fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL
models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices
improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically
tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across
seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:
ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and
1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The
primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2
achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to
512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and
ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across
initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models
using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned
86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation.
Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains
were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In
chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the
benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical
upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest
performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically,
these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for
chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting
subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care
settings.

Title: EigenScore: OOD Detection using Covariance in Diffusion Models
Authors: Shirin Shoushtari and Yi Wang and Xiao Shi and M. Salman Asif and
  Ulugbek S. Kamilov
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of
machine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have
recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex
data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress,
recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose
EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum
of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that
posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,
leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear
spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior
covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for
OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace
iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward
evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,
with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains
robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing
diffusion-based methods often fail.

\\
  Text-to-image synthesis has made remarkable progress, yet accurately
interpreting complex and lengthy prompts remains challenging, often resulting
in semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Existing solutions, such as
fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic
prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis
and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness.
Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or
sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve
these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization
strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play
multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis,
clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory
module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic,
interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts.
Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement
strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration.
Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7%
demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and
image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the
effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy. The code is

  In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to
facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike
existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers
164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with
diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The
dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X
motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning
and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we
present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple
baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director,
orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker
gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis
of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video
generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven
settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the
cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech
videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in
controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal
learning.

Title: Evaluating Fundus-Specific Foundation Models for Diabetic Macular Edema
  Detection
Authors: Franco Javier Arellano, Jos\'e Ignacio Orlando
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted for publication at SIPAIM 2025
\\
  Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among patients
with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). While deep learning has shown promising results
for automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application
remains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation
Models (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if
they can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we
systematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches
for this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal
images--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different
training regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and
OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do
not consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an
EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and
precision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing
promising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive
zero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted
appropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for
fine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning,
suggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce
environments.

Title: SpecGuard: Spectral Projection-based Advanced Invisible Watermarking

Comments: ICCV 2025 Accepted Paper
\\
  Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticity
verification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against various
transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and
adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we
introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible
image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden
convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency
domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed
by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform
approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.
In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse
attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,
ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder
leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark
pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We
evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,
capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed
SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models. To ensure reproducibility,
the full code is released on

\\
  Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model
multi-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How
do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate
MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance
mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that
formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via
video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture
instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video
attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We
find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization
that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask
tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.
We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware
video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and
semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations
validate our design choices. Codes and weights will be released.

  Manipulation

Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture
fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation
performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting
in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.
Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view
first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views
alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with
geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme
viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first
4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views.
WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and
incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate
geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation,
which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent
wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid,
Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with
superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the
average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the
anchor-wrist view gap.

  This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model
based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality,
flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative
depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive
performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent
space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details.
Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation
in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high
complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel
designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which
incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to
prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency
while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that
progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and
accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published
generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all
other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

  Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV) is a new research field at the
intersection of computer vision, optimisation theory, machine learning and
quantum computing. It has high potential to transform how visual signals are
processed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages
quantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.
non-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot
find a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,
quantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time
scalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can
also become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural
networks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new
algorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and
unveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision.
This survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic
review of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference
for the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students,
scientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise
themselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its
specifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware
and QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e.
gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the
operational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access,
program and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing
quantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to
publishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential social
implications.

Title: Temporal Prompting Matters: Rethinking Referring Video Object
  Segmentation
Authors: Ci-Siang Lin, Min-Hung Chen, I-Jieh Liu, Chien-Yi Wang, Sifei Liu,
  Yu-Chiang Frank Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object
referred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require
end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be
computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS
problem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing
foundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring,
video, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and
Selection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while
leaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt
image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object
segmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to
produce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While
high-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily
identified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt
Preference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts.
By taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models,
we would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object,
enabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation.
Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet
framework.

underlying hardware (an option that is typically not viable and introduces a
long down time) or make the data structure distributed. Static partitioning of
the data structure for distribution is not desirable, as it is prone to uneven
load distribution over time, and having to change the partitioning scheme later
will require downtime.
  Since a distributed data structure, inherently, relies on communication
support from the network stack and operating systems, we introduce the notion
of conditional lock-freedom that extends the notion of lock-free computation
with reasonable assumptions about communication between processes. We present
DiLi, a conditional lock-free, linearizable, and distributable linked list that
can be asynchronously and dynamically (1) partitioned into multiple sublists
and (2) load balanced by distributing sublists across multiple machines. DiLi
contains primitives for these that also maintain the lock-free property of the
underlying search structure that supports find, remove, and insert of a key as
the client operations.
  Searching for an item in DiLi is by a novel traversal that involves a binary
search on the partitioning scheme, and then a linear traversal on a limitable
number of linked nodes. As a result, we are able to empirically show that DiLi
performs as well as the state-of-the-art lock-free concurrent search structures
that are based off of a linked list when executed on a single-machine. We also
show that the throughput of DiLi scales linearly with the number of machines
that host it.

  Computational protein design is experiencing a transformation driven by
AI/ML. However, the range of potential protein sequences and structures is
astronomically vast, even for moderately sized proteins. Hence, achieving
convergence between generated and predicted structures demands substantial
computational resources for sampling. The Integrated Machine-learning for
Protein Structures at Scale (IMPRESS) offers methods and advanced computing
systems for coupling AI to high-performance computing tasks, enabling the
ability to evaluate the effectiveness of protein designs as they are developed,
as well as the models and simulations used to generate data and train models.
This paper introduces IMPRESS and demonstrates the development and
implementation of an adaptive protein design protocol and its supporting
computing infrastructure. This leads to increased consistency in the quality of
protein design and enhanced throughput of protein design due to dynamic
resource allocation and asynchronous workload execution.

Title: MuFASA -- Asynchronous Checkpoint for Weakly Consistent Fully Replicated
  Databases
Authors: Raaghav Ravishankar, Sandeep Kulkarni, Nitin H Vaidya
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  We focus on the problem of checkpointing in fully replicated weakly
consistent distributed databases, which we refer to as Distributed Transaction
Consistent Snapshot (DTCS). A typical example of such a system is a main-memory
database that provides strong eventual consistency. This problem is important
and challenging for several reasons: (1) eventual consistency often creates
anomalies that the users do not anticipate. Hence, frequent checkpoints to
ascertain desired invariants is highly beneficial in their use, and (2)
traditional checkpoints lead to significant overhead and/or inconsistencies. By
showing that the traditional checkpoint leads to inconsistencies or excessive
overhead, we define the notion of size-minimal checkpointing for fully
replicated databases. We present an algorithm for checkpointing with minimal
checkpointing overhead (only O(n) new messages and addition of a single counter
for existing messages). It also provides a significant benefit over existing
checkpointing algorithms for distributed systems and main-memory databases.
  A key benefit of DTCS is that it summarizes the computation by a sequence of
snapshots that are strongly consistent even though the underlying computation
is weakly consistent. In essence, when anomalies arise in an eventually
consistent system, DTCS enables one to concentrate solely on the snapshots
surrounding the time point of the anomaly.

Title: REACH: Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Microservice Rescheduling in
  the Cloud-Edge Continuum
Authors: Xu Bai, Muhammed Tawfiqul Islam, Rajkumar Buyya, Adel N. Toosi
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 10 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Cloud computing, despite its advantages in scalability, may not always fully
satisfy the low-latency demands of emerging latency-sensitive pervasive
applications. The cloud-edge continuum addresses this by integrating the
responsiveness of edge resources with cloud scalability. Microservice
Architecture (MSA) characterized by modular, loosely coupled services, aligns
effectively with this continuum. However, the heterogeneous and dynamic
computing resource poses significant challenges to the optimal placement of
microservices. We propose REACH, a novel rescheduling algorithm that
dynamically adapts microservice placement in real time using reinforcement
learning to react to fluctuating resource availability, and performance
variations across distributed infrastructures. Extensive experiments on a
real-world testbed demonstrate that REACH reduces average end-to-end latency by
7.9%, 10%, and 8% across three benchmark MSA applications, while effectively
mitigating latency fluctuations and spikes.

Title: Multi-Dimensional Autoscaling of Stream Processing Services on Edge
  Devices
Authors: Boris Sedlak, Philipp Raith, Andrea Morichetta, V\'ictor Casamayor
  Pujol, Schahram Dustdar
Categories: cs.DC cs.AI cs.LG cs.PF
\\
  Edge devices have limited resources, which inevitably leads to situations
where stream processing services cannot satisfy their needs. While existing
autoscaling mechanisms focus entirely on resource scaling, Edge devices require
alternative ways to sustain the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of competing
services. To address these issues, we introduce a Multi-dimensional Autoscaling
Platform (MUDAP) that supports fine-grained vertical scaling across both
service- and resource-level dimensions. MUDAP supports service-specific scaling
tailored to available parameters, e.g., scale data quality or model size for a
particular service. To optimize the execution across services, we present a
scaling agent based on Regression Analysis of Structural Knowledge (RASK). The
RASK agent efficiently explores the solution space and learns a continuous
regression model of the processing environment for inferring optimal scaling
actions. We compared our approach with two autoscalers, the Kubernetes VPA and
a reinforcement learning agent, for scaling up to 9 services on a single Edge
device. Our results showed that RASK can infer an accurate regression model in
merely 20 iterations (i.e., observe 200s of processing). By increasingly adding
elasticity dimensions, RASK sustained the highest request load with 28% less
SLO violations, compared to baselines.

Title: GROMACS Unplugged: How Power Capping and Frequency Shapes Performance on
  GPUs
Authors: Ayesha Afzal and Anna Kahler and Georg Hager and Gerhard Wellein
Categories: cs.DC cs.PF
Comments: 12 pages
\\
  Molecular dynamics simulations are essential tools in computational
biophysics, but their performance depend heavily on hardware choices and
configuration. In this work, we presents a comprehensive performance analysis
of four NVIDIA GPU accelerators -- A40, A100, L4, and L40 -- using six
representative GROMACS biomolecular workloads alongside two synthetic
benchmarks: Pi Solver (compute bound) and STREAM Triad (memory bound). We
investigate how performance scales with GPU graphics clock frequency and how
workloads respond to power capping. The two synthetic benchmarks define the
extremes of frequency scaling: Pi Solver shows ideal compute scalability, while
STREAM Triad reveals memory bandwidth limits -- framing GROMACS's performance
in context. Our results reveal distinct frequency scaling behaviors: Smaller
GROMACS systems exhibit strong frequency sensitivity, while larger systems
saturate quickly, becoming increasingly memory bound. Under power capping,
performance remains stable until architecture- and workload-specific thresholds
are reached, with high-end GPUs like the A100 maintaining near-maximum
performance even under reduced power budgets. Our findings provide practical
guidance for selecting GPU hardware and optimizing GROMACS performance for
large-scale MD workflows under power constraints.

Title: Evaluating Rapid Makespan Predictions for Heterogeneous Systems with
  Programmable Logic
Authors: Martin Wilhelm, Franz Freitag, Max Tzschoppe, Thilo Pionteck
Categories: cs.DC cs.AR
Comments: To be published on NorCAS 2025
\\
  Heterogeneous computing systems, which combine general-purpose processors
with specialized accelerators, are increasingly important for optimizing the
performance of modern applications. A central challenge is to decide which
parts of an application should be executed on which accelerator or, more
generally, how to map the tasks of an application to available devices.
Predicting the impact of a change in a task mapping on the overall makespan is
non-trivial. While there are very capable simulators, these generally require a
full implementation of the tasks in question, which is particularly
time-intensive for programmable logic. A promising alternative is to use a
purely analytical function, which allows for very fast predictions, but
abstracts significantly from reality. Bridging the gap between theory and
practice poses a significant challenge to algorithm developers. This paper aims
to aid in the development of rapid makespan prediction algorithms by providing
a highly flexible evaluation framework for heterogeneous systems consisting of
CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs, which is capable of collecting real-world makespan
results based on abstract task graph descriptions. We analyze to what extent
actual makespans can be predicted by existing analytical approaches.
Furthermore, we present common challenges that arise from high-level
characteristics such as data transfer overhead and device congestion in
heterogeneous systems.

Title: R3R: Decentralized Multi-Agent Collision Avoidance with Infinite-Horizon
  Safety
Authors: Thomas Marshall Vielmetti, Devansh R. Agrawal, Dimitra Panagou
Categories: cs.MA
Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX; submitted to the American Control Conference (ACC)
  2026
\\
  Existing decentralized methods for multi-agent motion planning lack formal,
infinite-horizon safety guarantees, especially for communication-constrained
systems. We present R3R, to our knowledge the first decentralized and
asynchronous framework for multi-agent motion planning under distance-based
communication constraints with infinite-horizon safety guarantees for systems
of nonlinear agents. R3R's novelty lies in combining our gatekeeper safety
framework with a geometric constraint called R-Boundedness, which together
establish a formal link between an agent's communication radius and its ability
to plan safely. We constrain trajectories to within a fixed planning radius
that is a function of the agent's communication radius, which enables
trajectories to be shown provably safe for all time, using only local
information. Our algorithm is fully asynchronous, and ensures the forward
invariance of these guarantees even in time-varying networks where agents
asynchronously join, leave, and replan. We validate our approach in simulations
of up to 128 Dubins vehicles, demonstrating 100% safety in dense, obstacle rich
scenarios. Our results demonstrate that R3R's performance scales with agent
density rather than problem size, providing a practical solution for scalable
and provably safe multi-agent systems.

  Telemanipulation of deformable objects requires high precision and dexterity
from the users, which can be increased by kinesthetic and tactile feedback.
However, the object shape can change dynamically, causing ambiguous perception
of its alignment and hence errors in the robot positioning. Therefore, the tilt
angle and position classification problem has to be solved to present a clear
tactile pattern to the user. This work presents a telemanipulation system for
plastic pipettes consisting of a multi-contact haptic device LinkGlide to
deliver haptic feedback at the users' palm and two tactile sensors array
embedded in the 2-finger Robotiq gripper. We propose a novel approach based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect the tilt and position while
grasping deformable objects. The CNN generates a mask based on recognized tilt
and position data to render further multi-contact tactile stimuli provided to
the user during the telemanipulation. The study has shown that using the CNN
algorithm and the preset mask, tilt, and position recognition by users is
increased from 9.67% using the direct data to 82.5%.

  The shape of deformable objects can change drastically during grasping by
robotic grippers, causing an ambiguous perception of their alignment and hence
resulting in errors in robot positioning and telemanipulation. Rendering clear
tactile patterns is fundamental to increasing users' precision and dexterity
through tactile haptic feedback during telemanipulation. Therefore, different
methods have to be studied to decode the sensors' data into haptic stimuli.
This work presents a telemanipulation system for plastic pipettes that consists
of a Force Dimension Omega.7 haptic interface endowed with two
electro-stimulation arrays and two tactile sensor arrays embedded in the
2-finger Robotiq gripper. We propose a novel approach based on convolutional
neural networks (CNN) to detect the tilt of deformable objects. The CNN
generates a tactile pattern based on recognized tilt data to render further
electro-tactile stimuli provided to the user during the telemanipulation. The
study has shown that using the CNN algorithm, tilt recognition by users
increased from 23.13\% with the downsized data to 57.9%, and the success rate
during teleoperation increased from 53.12% using the downsized data to 92.18%
using the tactile patterns generated by the CNN.

Categories: cs.HC cs.AI
\\
  Interface agents powered by generative AI models (referred to as "agents")
can automate actions based on user commands. An important aspect of developing
agents is their user experience (i.e., agent experience). There is a growing
need to provide scaffolds for a broader set of individuals beyond AI engineers
to prototype agent experiences, since they can contribute valuable perspectives
to designing agent experiences. In this work, we explore the affordances agent
prototyping systems should offer by conducting a requirements elicitation study
with 12 participants with varying experience with agents. We identify key
activities in agent experience prototyping and the desired capabilities of
agent prototyping systems. We instantiate those capabilities in the
AgentBuilder design probe for agent prototyping. We conduct an in situ agent
prototyping study with 14 participants using AgentBuilder to validate the
design requirements and elicit insights on how developers prototype agents and
what their needs are in this process.

Title: A Multimodal GUI Architecture for Interfacing with LLM-Based
  Conversational Assistants
Authors: Hans G.W. van Dam
Categories: cs.HC cs.AI
Comments: 24 pages, 19 figures
ACM-class: I.2.7; D.2.11
\\
  Advances in large language models (LLMs) and real-time speech recognition now
make it possible to issue any graphical user interface (GUI) action through
natural language and receive the corresponding system response directly through
the GUI. Most production applications were never designed with speech in mind.
This article provides a concrete architecture that enables GUIs to interface
with LLM-based speech-enabled assistants.
  The architecture makes an application's navigation graph and semantics
available through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The ViewModel, part of the
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, exposes the application's capabilities to
the assistant by supplying both tools applicable to a currently visible view
and application-global tools extracted from the GUI tree router. This
architecture facilitates full voice accessibility while ensuring reliable
alignment between spoken input and the visual interface, accompanied by
consistent feedback across modalities. It future-proofs apps for upcoming OS
super assistants that employ computer use agents (CUAs) and natively consume
MCP if an application provides it.
  To address concerns about privacy and data security, the practical
effectiveness of locally deployable, open-weight LLMs for speech-enabled
multimodal UIs is evaluated. Findings suggest that recent smaller open-weight
models approach the performance of leading proprietary models in overall
accuracy and require enterprise-grade hardware for fast responsiveness.

\\
  With recent advancements in multi-agent generative AI (Gen AI), technology
organizations like Microsoft are adopting these complex tools, redefining AI
agents as active collaborators in complex workflows rather than as passive
tools. In this study, we investigated how early adopters and developers
conceptualize multi-agent Gen AI tools, focusing on how they understand
human-AI collaboration mechanisms, general collaboration dynamics, and
transparency in the context of AI tools. We conducted semi-structured
interviews with 13 developers, all early adopters of multi-agent Gen AI
technology who work at Microsoft. Our findings revealed that these early
adopters conceptualize multi-agent systems as "teams" of specialized role-based
and task-based agents, such as assistants or reviewers, structured similar to
human collaboration models and ranging from AI-dominant to AI-assisted,
user-controlled interactions. We identified key challenges, including error
propagation, unpredictable and unproductive agent loop behavior, and the need
for clear communication to mitigate the layered transparency issues. Early
adopters' perspectives about the role of transparency underscored its
importance as a way to build trust, verify and trace errors, and prevent
misuse, errors, and leaks. The insights and design considerations we present
contribute to CSCW research about collaborative mechanisms with capabilities
ranging from AI-dominant to AI-assisted interactions, transparency and
oversight strategies in human-agent and agent-agent interactions, and how
humans make sense of these multi-agent systems as dynamic, role-diverse
collaborators which are customizable for diverse needs and workflows. We
conclude with future research directions that extend CSCW approaches to the
design of inter-agent and human mediation interactions.

\\
  Multi-agent social interaction has clearly benefited from Large Language
Models. However, current simulation systems still face challenges such as
difficulties in scaling to diverse scenarios and poor reusability due to a lack
of modular design. To address these issues, we designed and developed a
modular, object-oriented framework that organically integrates various base
classes through a hierarchical structure, harvesting scalability and
reusability. We inherited the framework to realize common derived classes.
Additionally, a memory summarization mechanism is proposed to filter and
distill relevant information from raw memory data, prioritizing contextually
salient events and interactions. By selecting and combining some necessary
derived classes, we customized a specific simulated environment. Utilizing this
simulated environment, we successfully simulated human interactions on social
media, replicating real-world online social behaviors. The source code for the
project will be released and evolve.

  Graph models help understand network dynamics and evolution. Creating graphs
with controlled topology and embedded partitions is a common strategy for
evaluating community detection algorithms. However, existing benchmarks often
overlook the need to track the evolution of communities in real-world networks.
To address this, a new community-centered model is proposed to generate
customizable evolving community structures where communities can grow, shrink,
merge, split, appear or disappear. This benchmark also generates the underlying
temporal network, where nodes can appear, disappear, or move between
communities. The benchmark has been used to test three methods, measuring their
performance in tracking nodes' cluster membership and detecting community
evolution. Python libraries, drawing utilities, and validation metrics are
provided to compare ground truth with algorithm results for detecting dynamic
communities.

Title: LLM-Driven Rubric-Based Assessment of Algebraic Competence in
  Multi-Stage Block Coding Tasks with Design and Field Evaluation
Authors: Yong Oh Lee, Byeonghun Bang, Sejun Oh
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  As online education platforms continue to expand, there is a growing need for
assessment methods that not only measure answer accuracy but also capture the
depth of students' cognitive processes in alignment with curriculum objectives.
This study proposes and evaluates a rubric-based assessment framework powered
by a large language model (LLM) for measuring algebraic competence,
real-world-context block coding tasks. The problem set, designed by mathematics
education experts, aligns each problem segment with five predefined rubric
dimensions, enabling the LLM to assess both correctness and quality of
students' problem-solving processes. The system was implemented on an online
platform that records all intermediate responses and employs the LLM for
rubric-aligned achievement evaluation. To examine the practical effectiveness
of the proposed framework, we conducted a field study involving 42 middle
school students engaged in multi-stage quadratic equation tasks with block
coding. The study integrated learner self-assessments and expert ratings to
benchmark the system's outputs. The LLM-based rubric evaluation showed strong
agreement with expert judgments and consistently produced rubric-aligned,
process-oriented feedback. These results demonstrate both the validity and
scalability of incorporating LLM-driven rubric assessment into online
mathematics and STEM education platforms.

  Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)

\\
  We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion
framework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic
electronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases.
RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human
Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph
comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this
8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward
stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically
plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining
score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces
timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag
triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated
ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean
Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by
greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream
predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the
DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55
safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61
plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong
resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating
biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can
simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for
rare-disease research.

Title: MCCE: A Framework for Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-Evolution
Authors: Nian Ran, Zhongzheng Li, Yue Wang, Qingsong Ran, Xiaoyuan Zhang,

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Multi-objective discrete optimization problems, such as molecular design,
pose significant challenges due to their vast and unstructured combinatorial
spaces. Traditional evolutionary algorithms often get trapped in local optima,
while expert knowledge can provide crucial guidance for accelerating
convergence. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful priors and reasoning
ability, making them natural optimizers when expert knowledge matters. However,
closed-source LLMs, though strong in exploration, cannot update their
parameters and thus cannot internalize experience. Conversely, smaller open
models can be continually fine-tuned but lack broad knowledge and reasoning
strength. We introduce Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE), a hybrid
framework that unites a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable
model. The system maintains a trajectory memory of past search processes; the
small model is progressively refined via reinforcement learning, with the two
models jointly supporting and complementing each other in global exploration.
Unlike model distillation, this process enhances the capabilities of both
models through mutual inspiration. Experiments on multi-objective drug design
benchmarks show that MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality and
consistently outperforms baselines. These results highlight a new paradigm for
enabling continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, combining knowledge-driven
exploration with experience-driven learning.

Title: A Total Variation Regularized Framework for Epilepsy-Related MRI Image
  Segmentation
Authors: Mehdi Rabiee, Sergio Greco, Reza Shahbazian, and Irina Trubitsyna
Categories: eess.IV cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) is a primary cause of drug-resistant epilepsy
and is difficult to detect in brain {magnetic resonance imaging} (MRI) due to
the subtle and small-scale nature of its lesions. Accurate segmentation of FCD
regions in 3D multimodal brain MRI images is essential for effective surgical
planning and treatment. However, this task remains highly challenging due to
the limited availability of annotated FCD datasets, the extremely small size
and weak contrast of FCD lesions, the complexity of handling 3D multimodal
inputs, and the need for output smoothness and anatomical consistency, which is
often not addressed by standard voxel-wise loss functions. This paper presents
a new framework for segmenting FCD regions in 3D brain MRI images. We adopt
state-of-the-art transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture and
introduce a novel loss function combining Dice loss with an anisotropic {Total
Variation} (TV) term. This integration encourages spatial smoothness and
reduces false positive clusters without relying on post-processing. The
framework is evaluated on a public FCD dataset with 85 epilepsy patients and
demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy and consistency compared to
standard loss formulations. The model with the proposed TV loss shows an 11.9\%
improvement on the Dice coefficient and 13.3\% higher precision over the
baseline model. Moreover, the number of false positive clusters is reduced by
61.6%

Title: RVFL-X: A Novel Randomized Network Based on Complex Transformed
  Real-Valued Tabular Datasets
Authors: M. Sajid, Mushir Akhtar, A. Quadir, M. Tanveer
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Journal-ref: International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 2025
\\
  Recent advancements in neural networks, supported by foundational theoretical
insights, emphasize the superior representational power of complex numbers.
However, their adoption in randomized neural networks (RNNs) has been limited
due to the lack of effective methods for transforming real-valued tabular
datasets into complex-valued representations. To address this limitation, we
propose two methods for generating complex-valued representations from
real-valued datasets: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven
method. Building on these mechanisms, we propose RVFL-X, a complex-valued
extension of the random vector functional link (RVFL) network. RVFL-X
integrates complex transformations into real-valued datasets while maintaining
the simplicity and efficiency of the original RVFL architecture. By leveraging
complex components such as input, weights, and activation functions, RVFL-X
processes complex representations and produces real-valued outputs.
Comprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate that
RVFL-X consistently outperforms both the original RVFL and state-of-the-art
(SOTA) RNN variants, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness across diverse
application domains.

  Vision language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and OpenCLIP, can encode and
reflect stereotypical associations between medical professions and demographic
attributes learned from web-scale data. We present an evaluation protocol for
healthcare settings that quantifies associated biases and assesses their
operational risk. Our methodology (i) defines a taxonomy spanning clinicians

pharmacist, technician), (ii) curates a profession-aware prompt suite to probe
model behavior, and (iii) benchmarks demographic skew against a balanced face
corpus. Empirically, we observe consistent demographic biases across multiple
roles and vision models. Our work highlights the importance of bias
identification in critical domains such as healthcare as AI-enabled hiring and
workforce analytics can have downstream implications for equity, compliance,

Title: SER-Diff: Synthetic Error Replay Diffusion for Incremental Brain Tumor
  Segmentation
Authors: Sashank Makanaboyina
Categories: eess.IV cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Incremental brain tumor segmentation is critical for models that must adapt
to evolving clinical datasets without retraining on all prior data. However,
catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge,
remains a major obstacle. Recent incremental learning frameworks with knowledge
distillation partially mitigate forgetting but rely heavily on generative
replay or auxiliary storage. Meanwhile, diffusion models have proven effective
for refining tumor segmentations, but have not been explored in incremental
learning contexts. We propose Synthetic Error Replay Diffusion (SER-Diff), the
first framework that unifies diffusion-based refinement with incremental
learning. SER-Diff leverages a frozen teacher diffusion model to generate
synthetic error maps from past tasks, which are replayed during training on new
tasks. A dual-loss formulation combining Dice loss for new data and knowledge
distillation loss for replayed errors ensures both adaptability and retention.
Experiments on BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 demonstrate that SER-Diff
consistently outperforms prior methods. It achieves the highest Dice scores of
95.8\%, 94.9\%, and 94.6\%, along with the lowest HD95 values of 4.4 mm, 4.7
mm, and 4.9 mm, respectively. These results indicate that SER-Diff not only
mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also delivers more accurate and
anatomically coherent segmentations across evolving datasets.

Title: Soft-Evidence Fused Graph Neural Network for Cancer Driver Gene
  Identification across Multi-View Biological Graphs
Authors: Bang Chen, Lijun Guo, Houli Fan, Wentao He, Rong Zhang
Categories: q-bio.GN cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 8pages
\\
  Identifying cancer driver genes (CDGs) is essential for understanding cancer
mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have
recently been employed to identify CDGs by capturing patterns in biological
interaction networks. However, most GNN-based approaches rely on a single
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, ignoring complementary information
from other biological networks. Some studies integrate multiple networks by
aligning features with consistency constraints to learn unified gene
representations for CDG identification. However, such representation-level
fusion often assumes congruent gene relationships across networks, which may
overlook network heterogeneity and introduce conflicting information. To
address this, we propose Soft-Evidence Fusion Graph Neural Network (SEFGNN), a
novel framework for CDG identification across multiple networks at the decision
level. Instead of enforcing feature-level consistency, SEFGNN treats each
biological network as an independent evidence source and performs
uncertainty-aware fusion at the decision level using Dempster-Shafer Theory
(DST). To alleviate the risk of overconfidence from DST, we further introduce a
Soft Evidence Smoothing (SES) module that improves ranking stability while
preserving discriminative performance. Experiments on three cancer datasets
show that SEFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
exhibits strong potential in discovering novel CDGs.

Title: Traj-Transformer: Diffusion Models with Transformer for GPS Trajectory
  Generation
Authors: Zhiyang Zhang, Ningcong Chen, Xin Zhang, Yanhua Li, Shen Su, Hui Lu,
  Jun Luo
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data
mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and
generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and
privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for
high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on
convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the
diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of
fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper,
we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer
backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We
explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and
longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different
scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory
Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively
alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.

\\
  Predicting precipitation maps is a highly complex spatiotemporal modeling
task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term
precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only
accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current
methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed
inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be
computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT,
a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block)
method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step.
Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT
factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal
attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation
nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI
(Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines
including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet)
models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event
localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x
faster than comparable baselines.

  Formally Verifiable Code
Authors: Lingfei Zeng, Fengdi Che, Xuhan Huang, Fei Ye, Xu Xu, Binhang Yuan,
  Jie Fu
Categories: cs.PL cs.AI
\\
  Formal verification is the next frontier for ensuring the correctness of code
generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). While methods that co-generate code
and formal specifications in formal languages, like Dafny, can, in principle,
prove alignment with user intent, progress is bottlenecked by specification
quality evaluation. Current benchmarks rely on matching against ground-truth
specifications, a manual and expertise-intensive process that has limited
existing datasets to a few hundred simple problems and also suffers from a
reliability issue. To address this, we introduce VeriEquivBench, a new
benchmark with $2,389$ complex algorithmic problems that probe the limitations
of current models in both code generation and formal reasoning. Our evaluation
framework replaces ground-truth matching with a formally grounded metric, the
equivalence score, and rigorously verifies the quality of generated
specifications and code. Our results show that generating formally verifiable
code remains a profound challenge for state-of-the-art LLMs. This underscores
both the difficulty of the task and the need for benchmarks like VeriEquivBench
to drive progress toward scalable and reliable coding agents.

\\
  We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies
the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference
capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR
performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained
autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief,
data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences
autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens
within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive
experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient
than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.
Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion
with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel
generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures
confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger
robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups
without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning
and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on
challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and
gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting
and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that
combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable,
high-throughput reasoning.

Title: Leveraging Large Language Models for Cybersecurity Risk Assessment -- A
  Case from Forestry Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: Fikret Mert G\"ultekin and Oscar Lilja and Ranim Khojah and Rebekka

\\
  In safety-critical software systems, cybersecurity activities become
essential, with risk assessment being one of the most critical. In many
software teams, cybersecurity experts are either entirely absent or represented
by only a small number of specialists. As a result, the workload for these
experts becomes high, and software engineers would need to conduct
cybersecurity activities themselves. This creates a need for a tool to support
cybersecurity experts and engineers in evaluating vulnerabilities and threats
during the risk assessment process. This paper explores the potential of
leveraging locally hosted large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented
generation to support cybersecurity risk assessment in the forestry domain
while complying with data protection and privacy requirements that limit
external data sharing. We performed a design science study involving 12 experts
in interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project.
The results demonstrate that LLMs can assist cybersecurity experts by
generating initial risk assessments, identifying threats, and providing
redundancy checks. The results also highlight the necessity for human oversight
to ensure accuracy and compliance. Despite trust concerns, experts were willing
to utilize LLMs in specific evaluation and assistance roles, rather than solely
relying on their generative capabilities. This study provides insights that
encourage the use of LLM-based agents to support the risk assessment process of
cyber-physical systems in safety-critical domains.

Title: Flexible Swarm Learning May Outpace Foundation Models in Essential Tasks
Authors: Moein E. Samadi, Andreas Schuppert
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.MA
\\
  Foundation models have rapidly advanced AI, raising the question of whether
their decisions will ultimately surpass human strategies in real-world domains.
The exponential, and possibly super-exponential, pace of AI development makes
such analysis elusive. Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for
daily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is
diagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.
  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments.
Effective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly
interacting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires
reliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins
of highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively
understood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI
models with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge
extends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these
settings before assuming broader decision-making roles.
  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient
self-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual
limits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized
architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents
representing the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent
covers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical
results on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing
applications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable
self-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments
compared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced
reproducibility in detail.

Title: Asking For It: Question-Answering for Predicting Rule Infractions in
  Online Content Moderation
Authors: Mattia Samory, Diana Pamfile, Andrew To, Shruti Phadke
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.CL cs.HC cs.LG
Comments: Accepted at ICWSM 2026
\\
  Online communities rely on a mix of platform policies and community-authored
rules to define acceptable behavior and maintain order. However, these rules
vary widely across communities, evolve over time, and are enforced
inconsistently, posing challenges for transparency, governance, and automation.
In this paper, we model the relationship between rules and their enforcement at
scale, introducing ModQ, a novel question-answering framework for
rule-sensitive content moderation. Unlike prior classification or
generation-based approaches, ModQ conditions on the full set of community rules
at inference time and identifies which rule best applies to a given comment. We
implement two model variants - extractive and multiple-choice QA - and train
them on large-scale datasets from Reddit and Lemmy, the latter of which we
construct from publicly available moderation logs and rule descriptions. Both
models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in identifying moderation-relevant
rule violations, while remaining lightweight and interpretable. Notably, ModQ
models generalize effectively to unseen communities and rules, supporting
low-resource moderation settings and dynamic governance environments.

Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Replicating human-level intelligence in the execution of embodied tasks
remains challenging due to the unconstrained nature of real-world environments.
Novel use of large language models (LLMs) for task planning seeks to address
the previously intractable state/action space of complex planning tasks, but
hallucinations limit their reliability, and thus, viability beyond a research
context. Additionally, the prompt engineering required to achieve adequate
system performance lacks transparency, and thus, repeatability. In contrast to
LLM planning, symbolic planning methods offer strong reliability and
repeatability guarantees, but struggle to scale to the complexity and ambiguity
of real-world tasks. We introduce a new robotic planning method that augments
LLM planners with symbolic planning oversight to improve reliability and
repeatability, and provide a transparent approach to defining hard constraints
with considerably stronger clarity than traditional prompt engineering.
Importantly, these augmentations preserve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
and retain impressive generalization in open-world environments. We demonstrate
our approach in simulated and real-world environments. On the ALFWorld planning
benchmark, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving
a near-perfect 99% success rate. Deployment of our method to a real-world
quadruped robot resulted in 100% task success compared to 50% and 30% for pure
LLM and symbolic planners across embodied pick and place tasks. Our approach
presents an effective strategy to enhance the reliability, repeatability and
transparency of LLM-based robot planners while retaining their key strengths:
flexibility and generalizability to complex real-world environments. We hope
that this work will contribute to the broad goal of building resilient embodied
intelligent systems.

  Pretrained transformers readily adapt to new sequence modeling tasks via
zero-shot prompting, but relational domains still lack architectures that
transfer across datasets and tasks. The core challenge is the diversity of
relational data, with varying heterogeneous schemas, graph structures and
functional dependencies. In this paper, we present the Relational Transformer
(RT) architecture, which can be pretrained on diverse relational databases and
directly applied to unseen datasets and tasks without task- or dataset-specific
fine-tuning, or retrieval of in-context examples. RT (i) tokenizes cells with
table/column metadata, (ii) is pretrained via masked token prediction, and
(iii) utilizes a novel \textit{Relational Attention} mechanism over columns,
rows, and primary-foreign key links. Pretrained on RelBench datasets spanning
tasks such as churn and sales forecasting, RT attains strong zero-shot
performance, averaging 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification
tasks with a single forward pass of a 22M parameter model, as opposed to 84%
for a 27B LLM. Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample
efficiency. Our experiments show that RT's zero-shot transfer harnesses
task-table context, relational attention patterns and schema semantics.
Overall, RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational
data.

Title: Monte Carlo Permutation Search
Authors: Tristan Cazenave
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We propose Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS), a general-purpose Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that improves upon the GRAVE algorithm. MCPS
is relevant when deep reinforcement learning is not an option, or when the
computing power available before play is not substantial, such as in General
Game Playing, for example. The principle of MCPS is to include in the
exploration term of a node the statistics on all the playouts that contain all
the moves on the path from the root to the node. We extensively test MCPS on a
variety of games: board games, wargame, investment game, video game and
multi-player games. MCPS has better results than GRAVE in all the two-player
games. It has equivalent results for multi-player games because these games are
inherently balanced even when players have different strengths. We also show
that using abstract codes for moves instead of exact codes can be beneficial to
both MCPS and GRAVE, as they improve the permutation statistics and the AMAF
statistics. We also provide a mathematical derivation of the formulas used for
weighting the three sources of statistics. These formulas are an improvement on
the GRAVE formula since they no longer use the bias hyperparameter of GRAVE.
Moreover, MCPS is not sensitive to the ref hyperparameter.

Title: Geometry-Aware Backdoor Attacks: Leveraging Curvature in Hyperbolic
  Embeddings
Authors: Ali Baheri
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Non-Euclidean foundation models increasingly place representations in curved
spaces such as hyperbolic geometry. We show that this geometry creates a
boundary-driven asymmetry that backdoor triggers can exploit. Near the
boundary, small input changes appear subtle to standard input-space detectors
but produce disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation
space. Our analysis formalizes this effect and also reveals a limitation for
defenses: methods that act by pulling points inward along the radius can
suppress such triggers, but only by sacrificing useful model sensitivity in
that same direction. Building on these insights, we propose a simple
geometry-adaptive trigger and evaluate it across tasks and architectures.
Empirically, attack success increases toward the boundary, whereas conventional
detectors weaken, mirroring the theoretical trends. Together, these results
surface a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models and offer
analysis-backed guidance for designing and understanding the limits of
defenses.

  In decentralized learning networks, predictions from many participants are
combined to generate a network inference. While many studies have demonstrated
performance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing
strategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to
dynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations
that rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.
Due to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving
averages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing
circumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that
uses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at
each epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning
higher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We
show that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning
network, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the
accuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that
predict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret
z-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than
models predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network
inference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series
of optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model
can be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.
These properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each
domain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using
performance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any
situation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed.

Title: How NOT to benchmark your SITE metric: Beyond Static Leaderboards and
  Towards Realistic Evaluation
Authors: Prabhant Singh, Sibylle Hess, Joaquin Vanschoren
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Transferability estimation metrics are used to find a high-performing
pre-trained model for a given target task without fine-tuning models and
without access to the source dataset. Despite the growing interest in
developing such metrics, the benchmarks used to measure their progress have
gone largely unexamined. In this work, we empirically show the shortcomings of
widely used benchmark setups to evaluate transferability estimation metrics. We
argue that the benchmarks on which these metrics are evaluated are
fundamentally flawed. We empirically demonstrate that their unrealistic model
spaces and static performance hierarchies artificially inflate the perceived
performance of existing metrics, to the point where simple, dataset-agnostic
heuristics can outperform sophisticated methods. Our analysis reveals a
critical disconnect between current evaluation protocols and the complexities
of real-world model selection. To address this, we provide concrete
recommendations for constructing more robust and realistic benchmarks to guide
future research in a more meaningful direction.

  As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous in workplace tools and
decision-making processes, ensuring explainability and fostering user trust are
critical. Although advancements in LLM engineering continue, human-centered
design is still catching up, particularly when it comes to embedding
transparency and trust into AI interfaces. This study evaluates user
experiences with two distinct AI interfaces - node-tree interfaces and chatbot
interfaces - to assess their performance in exploratory, follow-up inquiry,
decision-making, and problem-solving tasks. Our design-driven approach
introduces a node-tree interface that visually structures AI-generated
responses into hierarchically organized, interactive nodes, allowing users to
navigate, refine, and follow up on complex information. In a comparative study
with n=20 business users, we observed that while the chatbot interface
effectively supports linear, step-by-step queries, it is the node-tree
interface that enhances brainstorming. Quantitative and qualitative findings
indicate that node-tree interfaces not only improve task performance and
decision-making support but also promote higher levels of user trust by
preserving context. Our findings suggest that adaptive AI interfaces capable of
switching between structured visualizations and conversational formats based on
task requirements can significantly enhance transparency and user confidence in
AI-powered systems. This work contributes actionable insights to the fields of
human-robot interaction and AI design, particularly for enterprise applications
where trust-building is critical for teams.

Title: Deep Generative Model for Human Mobility Behavior
Authors: Ye Hong, Yatao Zhang, Konrad Schindler, Martin Raubal
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.AI cs.SI
\\
  Understanding and modeling human mobility is central to challenges in
transport planning, sustainable urban design, and public health. Despite
decades of effort, simulating individual mobility remains challenging because
of its complex, context-dependent, and exploratory nature. Here, we present
MobilityGen, a deep generative model that produces realistic mobility
trajectories spanning days to weeks at large spatial scales. By linking
behavioral attributes with environmental context, MobilityGen reproduces key
patterns such as scaling laws for location visits, activity time allocation,
and the coupled evolution of travel mode and destination choices. It reflects
spatio-temporal variability and generates diverse, plausible, and novel
mobility patterns consistent with the built environment. Beyond standard
validation, MobilityGen yields insights not attainable with earlier models,
including how access to urban space varies across travel modes and how
co-presence dynamics shape social exposure and segregation. Our work
establishes a new framework for mobility simulation, paving the way for
fine-grained, data-driven studies of human behavior and its societal
implications.

Title: Attention Sinks and Compression Valleys in LLMs are Two Sides of the
  Same Coin
Authors: Enrique Queipo-de-Llano, \'Alvaro Arroyo, Federico Barbero, Xiaowen
  Dong, Michael Bronstein, Yann LeCun, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention
as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in
isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention
sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive
activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive
activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish
bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several
models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence
token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression
valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies
validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose
the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain
how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and
representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit
that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad
mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in
the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our
framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate
layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying
differences in task-dependent representations.

Title: Valid Stopping for LLM Generation via Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift
Authors: Sanjeda Akter, Ibne Farabi Shihab, Anuj Sharma
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We introduce Sequential-EDFL (Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift), applying
anytime-valid sequential testing to language model generation stopping. Our
approach tracks information lift -- the log-likelihood ratio between full
models and deliberately weakened "skeleton" baselines -- using self-normalized
empirical-Bernstein e-processes that provide formal delta-level error control
regardless of stopping time. We handle unknown centering through online mean
estimation, combine multiple parameters via mixture e-processes, and support
adaptive resets under distributional drift. On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL
reduces generation by 22-28% vs. sequential baselines while maintaining
delta-level control with 12% computational overhead. We introduce automated
skeletons (distilled submodels, randomized logits) and show robustness across
skeleton families. Composing EDFL with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence
boundaries + verifier) improves end-task correctness while preserving
anytime-valid guarantees by only delaying stopping. Our certificates control
information sufficiency, not factual correctness -- 10.9% of stopped sequences
remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2-22.7% without it). EDFL serves as a
first-stage filter reducing verification burden by 83%, not as a standalone
solution for safety-critical domains.

Title: ATLO-ML: Adaptive Time-Length Optimizer for Machine Learning -- Insights
  from Air Quality Forecasting
Authors: I-Hsi Kao, Kanji Uchino
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Accurate time-series predictions in machine learning are heavily influenced
by the selection of appropriate input time length and sampling rate. This paper
introduces ATLO-ML, an adaptive time-length optimization system that
automatically determines the optimal input time length and sampling rate based
on user-defined output time length. The system provides a flexible approach to
time-series data pre-processing, dynamically adjusting these parameters to
enhance predictive performance. ATLO-ML is validated using air quality
datasets, including both GAMS-dataset and proprietary data collected from a
data center, both in time series format. Results demonstrate that utilizing the
optimized time length and sampling rate significantly improves the accuracy of
machine learning models compared to fixed time lengths. ATLO-ML shows potential
for generalization across various time-sensitive applications, offering a
robust solution for optimizing temporal input parameters in machine learning
workflows.

Title: A Median Perspective on Unlabeled Data for Out-of-Distribution Detection

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI math.OC stat.ML
\\
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the
robustness and reliability of machine learning systems deployed in real-world
applications. Recent approaches have explored the use of unlabeled data,
showing potential for enhancing OOD detection capabilities. However,
effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data remains challenging due to the
mixed nature of both in-distribution (InD) and OOD samples. The lack of a
distinct set of OOD samples complicates the task of training an optimal OOD
classifier. In this work, we introduce Medix, a novel framework designed to
identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation. We
use the median because it provides a stable estimate of the central tendency,
as an OOD detection mechanism, due to its robustness against noise and
outliers. Using these identified outliers, along with labeled InD data, we
train a robust OOD classifier. From a theoretical perspective, we derive error
bounds that demonstrate Medix achieves a low error rate. Empirical results
further substantiate our claims, as Medix outperforms existing methods across
the board in open-world settings, confirming the validity of our theoretical
insights.

Categories: quant-ph cs.AI
\\
  Quantum compute is scaling fast, from cloud QPUs to high throughput GPU
simulators, making it timely to prototype quantum NLP beyond toy tasks.
However, devices remain qubit limited and depth limited, training can be
unstable, and classical attention is compute and memory heavy. This motivates
compact, phase aware quantum token mixers that stabilize amplitudes and scale
to long sequences. We present CLAQS, a compact, fully quantum token mixer for
text classification that jointly learns complex-valued mixing and nonlinear
transformations within a unified quantum circuit. To enable stable end-to-end
optimization, we apply l1 normalization to regulate amplitude scaling and
introduce a two-stage parameterized quantum architecture that decouples shared
token embeddings from a window-level quantum feed-forward module. Operating
under a sliding-window regime with document-level aggregation, CLAQS requires
only eight data qubits and shallow circuits, yet achieves 91.64% accuracy on
SST-2 and 87.08% on IMDB, outperforming both classical Transformer baselines
and strong hybrid quantum-classical counterparts.

Title: Scalable Policy-Based RL Algorithms for POMDPs
Authors: Ameya Anjarlekar, Rasoul Etesami, R Srikant
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 36 pages, 3 Figures, Accepted at NeurIPS 2025
\\
  The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant
computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we
consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning
(PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a
finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first
derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the
optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value
function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning
approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the
Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be
approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by
treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We
show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of
this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the
first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD
learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.

Title: Incoherence in goal-conditioned autoregressive models
Authors: Jacek Karwowski, Raymond Douglas
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We investigate mathematically the notion of incoherence: a structural issue
with reinforcement learning policies derived by naive goal-conditioning of
autoregressive models. We focus on the process of re-training models on their
own actions, that is, fine-tuning offline-learned policies with online RL. We
prove that it decreases incoherence and leads to an improvement in return, and
we aim to characterize the resulting trajectory of policies. By re-framing
standard notions of control-as-inference and soft Q learning, we establish a
three-way correspondence with two other ways of understanding the iterative
re-training process: as folding the posterior into the reward and, in the
deterministic case, as decreasing the temperature parameter; the correspondence
has computational content via the training-inference trade-off. Through
soft-conditioning generative models, we discuss the link between incoherence
and the effective horizon.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training
reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard
RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior
reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies
to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment
itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances
reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking
length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear
compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL
environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each
chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the
context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the
policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient
for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this
environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up
to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget.
With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus.
The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K
average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink.
Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B)
often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing
positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that
redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long
reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient,
scalable reasoning LLMs.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI eess.IV
\\
  Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for supporting clinical
trials, from patient recruitment and endpoint assessment to treatment response
prediction. However, deploying AI without safeguards poses significant risks,
particularly when evaluating patient endpoints that directly impact trial
conclusions. We compared two AI frameworks against human-only assessment for
medical image-based disease evaluation, measuring cost, accuracy, robustness,
and generalization ability. To stress-test these frameworks, we injected bad
models, ranging from random guesses to naive predictions, to ensure that
observed treatment effects remain valid even under severe model degradation. We
evaluated the frameworks using two randomized controlled trials with endpoints
derived from spinal X-ray images. Our findings indicate that using AI as a
supporting reader (AI-SR) is the most suitable approach for clinical trials, as
it meets all criteria across various model types, even with bad models. This
method consistently provides reliable disease estimation, preserves clinical
trial treatment effect estimates and conclusions, and retains these advantages
when applied to different populations.

  via Zeroth-order Gradient Estimation
Authors: Shuo Shao, Yiming Li, Hongwei Yao, Yifei Chen, Yuchen Yang, Zhan Qin
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  The substantial investment required to develop Large Language Models (LLMs)
makes them valuable intellectual property, raising significant concerns about
copyright protection. LLM fingerprinting has emerged as a key technique to
address this, which aims to verify a model's origin by extracting an intrinsic,
unique signature (a "fingerprint") and comparing it to that of a source model
to identify illicit copies. However, existing black-box fingerprinting methods
often fail to generate distinctive LLM fingerprints. This ineffectiveness
arises because black-box methods typically rely on model outputs, which lose
critical information about the model's unique parameters due to the usage of
non-linear functions. To address this, we first leverage Fisher Information
Theory to formally demonstrate that the gradient of the model's input is a more
informative feature for fingerprinting than the output. Based on this insight,
we propose ZeroPrint, a novel method that approximates these information-rich
gradients in a black-box setting using zeroth-order estimation. ZeroPrint
overcomes the challenge of applying this to discrete text by simulating input
perturbations via semantic-preserving word substitutions. This operation allows
ZeroPrint to estimate the model's Jacobian matrix as a unique fingerprint.
Experiments on the standard benchmark show ZeroPrint achieves a
state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, significantly outperforming
existing black-box methods.

  Underground water and wastewater pipelines are vital for city operations but
plagued by anomalies like leaks and infiltrations, causing substantial water
loss, environmental damage, and high repair costs. Conventional manual
inspections lack efficiency, while dense sensor deployments are prohibitively
expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly and is
increasingly applied to urban infrastructure. In this research, we propose an
integrated AI and remote-sensor framework to address the challenge of leak
detection in underground water pipelines, through deploying a sparse set of
remote sensors to capture real-time flow and depth data, paired with HydroNet -
a dedicated model utilizing pipeline attributes (e.g., material, diameter,
slope) in a directed graph for higher-precision modeling. Evaluations on a
real-world campus wastewater network dataset demonstrate that our system
collects effective spatio-temporal hydraulic data, enabling HydroNet to
outperform advanced baselines. This integration of edge-aware message passing
with hydraulic simulations enables accurate network-wide predictions from
limited sensor deployments. We envision that this approach can be effectively
extended to a wide range of underground water pipeline networks.

  Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion
models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains

ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing
future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming
observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the
context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial
differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often
computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse
observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout
with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or
optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and
physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We
will release code and checkpoints publicly.

Comments: 25 pages, 10 figures
\\
  The increasing complexity of modern software systems exacerbates the
prevalence of security vulnerabilities, posing risks of severe breaches and
substantial economic loss. Consequently, robust code vulnerability detection is
essential for software security. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their
potential for automated code vulnerability detection remains underexplored.
This paper presents FineSec, a novel framework that harnesses LLMs through
knowledge distillation to enable efficient and precise vulnerability
identification in C/C++ codebases. FineSec utilizes knowledge distillation to
transfer expertise from large teacher models to compact student models,
achieving high accuracy with minimal computational cost. By integrating data
preparation, training, evaluation, and continuous learning into a unified,
single-task workflow, FineSec offers a streamlined approach. Extensive
evaluations on C/C++ codebases demonstrate its superiority over both base
models and larger LLMs in identifying complex vulnerabilities and logical
flaws, establishing FineSec as a practical and scalable solution for real-world
software security. To facilitate reproducibility, the datasets, source code,

  Operators

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing
more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are
represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced
as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can
perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether
this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot
super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on
higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We
comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution
(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution
inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency
information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically
demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.
Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at
resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they
are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we
propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution
training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust
multi-resolution generalization.

Title: Local Reinforcement Learning with Action-Conditioned Root Mean Squared
  Q-Functions
Authors: Frank Wu and Mengye Ren
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 15 pages, 5 figures
\\
  The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm is a recently proposed learning procedure
for neural networks that employs two forward passes instead of the traditional
forward and backward passes used in backpropagation. However, FF remains
largely confined to supervised settings, leaving a gap at domains where
learning signals can be yielded more naturally such as RL. In this work,
inspired by FF's goodness function using layer activity statistics, we
introduce Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ), a novel value
estimation method that applies a goodness function and action conditioning for
local RL using temporal difference learning. Despite its simplicity and
biological grounding, our approach achieves superior performance compared to

  We present a risk-aware safety certification method for autonomous, learning
enabled control systems. Focusing on two realistic risks, state/input delays
and interval matrix uncertainty, we model the neural network (NN) controller
with local sector bounds and exploit positivity structure to derive linear,
delay-independent certificates that guarantee local exponential stability
across admissible uncertainties. To benchmark performance, we adopt and
implement a state-of-the-art IQC NN verification pipeline. On representative
cases, our positivity-based tests run orders of magnitude faster than SDP-based
IQC while certifying regimes the latter cannot-providing scalable safety
guarantees that complement risk-aware control.

Title: AISysRev - LLM-based Tool for Title-abstract Screening
Authors: Aleksi Huotala, Miikka Kuutila, Olli-Pekka Turtio, Mika M\"antyl\"a
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
Comments: 4 pages
\\
  Systematic reviews are a standard practice for summarizing the state of
evidence in software engineering. Conducting systematic reviews is laborious,
especially during the screening or study selection phase, where the number of
papers can be overwhelming. During this phase, papers are assessed against
inclusion and exclusion criteria based on their titles and abstracts. Recent
research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can perform
title-abstract screening at a level comparable to that of a master's student.
While LLMs cannot be fully trusted, they can help, for example, in Rapid
Reviews, which try to expedite the review process. Building on recent research,
we developed AiSysRev, an LLM-based screening tool implemented as a web
application running in a Docker container. The tool accepts a CSV file
containing paper titles and abstracts. Users specify inclusion and exclusion
criteria. One can use multiple LLMs for screening via OpenRouter. AiSysRev
supports both zero-shot and few-shot screening, and also allows for manual
screening through interfaces that display LLM results as guidance for human
reviewers.We conducted a trial study with 137 papers using the tool. Our
findings indicate that papers can be classified into four categories: Easy
Includes, Easy Excludes, Boundary Includes, and Boundary Excludes. The Boundary
cases, where LLMs are prone to errors, highlight the need for human
intervention. While LLMs do not replace human judgment in systematic reviews,
they can significantly reduce the burden of assessing large volumes of
scientific literature. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVbEj4Y4tQI Tool:

Title: Dual Goal Representations
Authors: Seohong Park, Deepinder Mann, Sergey Levine
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  In this work, we introduce dual goal representations for goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning (GCRL). A dual goal representation characterizes a state
by "the set of temporal distances from all other states"; in other words, it
encodes a state through its relations to every other state, measured by
temporal distance. This representation provides several appealing theoretical
properties. First, it depends only on the intrinsic dynamics of the environment
and is invariant to the original state representation. Second, it contains
provably sufficient information to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy,
while being able to filter out exogenous noise. Based on this concept, we
develop a practical goal representation learning method that can be combined
with any existing GCRL algorithm. Through diverse experiments on the OGBench
task suite, we empirically show that dual goal representations consistently
improve offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based
tasks.

  The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for quantitative modeling and
analysis to understand real-world disease dynamics. In particular, post hoc
analyses using compartmental models offer valuable insights into the
effectiveness of public health interventions, such as vaccination strategies
and containment policies. However, such compartmental models like SIR
(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) often face limitations in directly
incorporating noisy observational data. In this work, we employ
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the inverse problem of the
SIR model using infection data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Our main
contribution is a fine-grained, spatio-temporal analysis of COVID-19 dynamics
across all German federal states over a three-year period. We estimate
state-specific transmission and recovery parameters and time-varying
reproduction number (R_t) to track the pandemic progression. The results
highlight strong variations in transmission behavior across regions, revealing
correlations with vaccination uptake and temporal patterns associated with
major pandemic phases. Our findings demonstrate the utility of PINNs in
localized, long-term epidemiological modeling.

Title: Recurrence-Complete Frame-based Action Models
Authors: Michael Keiblinger
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  In recent years, attention-like mechanisms have been used to great success in
the space of large language models, unlocking scaling potential to a previously
unthinkable extent. "Attention Is All You Need" famously claims RNN cells are
not needed in conjunction with attention. We challenge this view. In this
paper, we point to existing proofs that architectures with fully parallelizable
forward or backward passes cannot represent classes of problems specifically
interesting for long-running agentic tasks. We further conjecture a critical
time t beyond which non-recurrence-complete models fail to aggregate inputs
correctly, with concrete implications for agentic systems (e.g., software
engineering agents). To address this, we introduce a recurrence-complete
architecture and train it on GitHub-derived action sequences. Loss follows a
power law in the trained sequence length while the parameter count remains
fixed. Moreover, longer-sequence training always amortizes its linearly
increasing wall-time cost, yielding lower loss as a function of wall time.

Title: CNN-TFT explained by SHAP with multi-head attention weights for time
  series forecasting
Authors: Stefano F. Stefenon, Jo\~ao P. Matos-Carvalho, Valderi R. Q.
  Leithardt, Kin-Choong Yow
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures offer
strengths for modeling temporal data: CNNs excel at capturing local patterns
and translational invariances, while transformers effectively model long-range
dependencies via self-attention. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture
integrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer
(TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module
first applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill
salient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and
dimensionality. The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which
applies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies
and to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a
hydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models,
with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the
model is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head
attention weights (SHAP-MHAW). Our novel architecture, named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW,
is promising for applications requiring high-fidelity, multivariate time series
forecasts, being available for future analysis at

Title: Enhancing Bankruptcy Prediction of Banks through Advanced Machine
  Learning Techniques: An Innovative Approach and Analysis
Authors: Zuherman Rustam, Sri Hartini, Sardar M.N. Islam, Fevi Novkaniza,
  Fiftitah R. Aszhari, Muhammad Rifqi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Context: Financial system stability is determined by the condition of the
banking system. A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial
system, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual
banks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the
probability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is
safe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such
as Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a
bankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and
sometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.
New approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are
developed using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),
random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several
studies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical
methods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present
Research: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial
statements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to
2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports
of 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.
Five rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the
feasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The
results of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from
commercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine
learning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank
bankruptcy. Contribution and Conclusion: The proposed innovative machine
learning approach help to implement policies that reduce the costs of
bankruptcy.

Title: Towards Generalization of Graph Neural Networks for AC Optimal Power
  Flow
Authors: Olayiwola Arowolo, Jochen L. Cremer
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Pre-print has been submitted for review
\\
  AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale
power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times.
Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with
scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable
scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose
a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models
buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as
distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for
handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN
achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot
to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap
despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also
improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to
10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical,
generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.

  for Semantically Aligned Image Retrieval
Authors: Didrik Bergstr\"om and Deniz G\"und\"uz and Onur G\"unl\"u
Categories: cs.IT cs.AI cs.CR cs.LG math.IT
\\
  We consider image transmission via deep joint source-channel coding
(DeepJSCC) over multi-hop additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels by
training a DeepJSCC encoder-decoder pair with a pre-trained deep hash
distillation (DHD) module to semantically cluster images, facilitating
security-oriented applications through enhanced semantic consistency and
improving the perceptual reconstruction quality. We train the DeepJSCC module
to both reduce mean square error (MSE) and minimize cosine distance between DHD
hashes of source and reconstructed images. Significantly improved perceptual
quality as a result of semantic alignment is illustrated for different
multi-hop settings, for which classical DeepJSCC may suffer from noise
accumulation, measured by the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS)
metric.

  The integration of multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging due to
high-dimensionality and complex inter-modality relationships. To address this,
we introduce MoRE-GNN (Multi-omics Relational Edge Graph Neural Network), a
heterogeneous graph autoencoder that combines graph convolution and attention
mechanisms to dynamically construct relational graphs directly from data.
Evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN
captures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing
methods, particularly in settings with strong inter-modality correlations.
Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream
cross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity,
MoRE-GNN offers an adaptive, scalable and interpretable framework for advancing
multi-omics integration.

\\
  With the increasing use of RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG), strong
retrieval models have become more important than ever. In healthcare,
multimodal retrieval models that combine information from both text and images
offer major advantages for many downstream tasks such as question answering,
cross-modal retrieval, and multimodal summarization, since medical data often
includes both formats. However, there is currently no standard benchmark to
evaluate how well these models perform in medical settings. To address this
gap, we introduce M3Retrieve, a Multimodal Medical Retrieval Benchmark.
M3Retrieve, spans 5 domains,16 medical fields, and 4 distinct tasks, with over
1.2 Million text documents and 164K multimodal queries, all collected under
approved licenses. We evaluate leading multimodal retrieval models on this
benchmark to explore the challenges specific to different medical specialities
and to understand their impact on retrieval performance. By releasing
M3Retrieve, we aim to enable systematic evaluation, foster model innovation,
and accelerate research toward building more capable and reliable multimodal
retrieval systems for medical applications. The dataset and the baselines code
are available in this github page https://github.com/AkashGhosh/M3Retrieve.

  Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise
constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are
either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with
learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and
real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a
novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using
the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes
pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in
angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering.
SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to
specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid
inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical
guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on
diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights,
confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world
effectiveness. Code is available at

Title: Emotionally Vulnerable Subtype of Internet Gaming Disorder: Measuring

Comments: 27 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables
\\
  Concerns over the potential over-pathologization of generative AI (GenAI) use
and the lack of conceptual clarity surrounding GenAI addiction call for
empirical tools and theoretical refinement. This study developed and validated
the PUGenAIS-9 (Problematic Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Scale-9
items) and examined whether PUGenAIS reflects addiction-like patterns under the
Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) framework. Using samples from China and the
United States (N = 1,508), we conducted confirmatory factor analysis and
identified a robust 31-item structure across nine IGD-based dimensions. We then
derived the PUGenAIS-9 by selecting the highest-loading items from each
dimension and validated its structure in an independent sample (N = 1,426).
Measurement invariance tests confirmed its stability across nationality and
gender. Person-centered (latent profile analysis) and variable-centered
(network analysis) approaches found that PUGenAIS matches the traits of the
emotionally vulnerable subtype of IGD, not the competence-based kind. These
results support using PUGenAIS-9 to identify problematic GenAI use and show the
need to rethink digital addiction with an ICD (infrastructures, content, and
device) model. This keeps addiction research responsive to new media while
avoiding over-pathologizing.

Title: DecompGAIL: Learning Realistic Traffic Behaviors with Decomposed
  Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
Authors: Ke Guo, Haochen Liu, Xiaojun Wu, Chen Lv
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO
\\
  Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous
driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning
approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning
suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
(GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key
source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a
discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic
interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed
Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map
and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and
neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that
augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging
overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based
backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim
Agents 2025 benchmark.

  We present a method that models the evolution of an unbounded number of time
series clusters by switching among an unknown number of regimes with linear
dynamics. We develop a Bayesian non-parametric approach using a hierarchical
Dirichlet process as a prior on the parameters of a Switching Linear Dynamical
System and a Gaussian process prior to model the statistical variations in
amplitude and temporal alignment within each cluster. By modeling the evolution
of time series patterns, the method avoids unnecessary proliferation of
clusters in a principled manner. We perform inference by formulating a
variational lower bound for off-line and on-line scenarios, enabling efficient
learning through optimization. We illustrate the versatility and effectiveness
of the approach through several case studies of electrocardiogram analysis
using publicly available databases.

Categories: quant-ph cs.AI
Comments: 22 pages, 4 figures
\\
  The aim of this paper is to introduce a quantum fusion mechanism for
multimodal learning and to establish its theoretical and empirical potential.
The proposed method, called the Quantum Fusion Layer (QFL), replaces classical
fusion schemes with a hybrid quantum-classical procedure that uses
parameterized quantum circuits to learn entangled feature interactions without
requiring exponential parameter growth. Supported by quantum signal processing
principles, the quantum component efficiently represents high-order polynomial
interactions across modalities with linear parameter scaling, and we provide a
separation example between QFL and low-rank tensor-based methods that
highlights potential quantum query advantages. In simulation, QFL consistently
outperforms strong classical baselines on small but diverse multimodal tasks,
with particularly marked improvements in high-modality regimes. These results
suggest that QFL offers a fundamentally new and scalable approach to multimodal
fusion that merits deeper exploration on larger systems.

  The self-attention mechanism, while foundational to modern Transformer
architectures, suffers from a critical inefficiency: it frequently allocates
substantial attention to redundant or noisy context. Differential Attention
addressed this by using subtractive attention maps for signal and noise, but
its required balanced head allocation imposes rigid constraints on
representational flexibility and scalability.
  To overcome this, we propose Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a novel
approach that introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving
and noise-control groups. GDA significantly enhances signal focus by
strategically assigning more heads to signal extraction and fewer to
noise-control, stabilizing the latter through controlled repetition (akin to
GQA). This design achieves stronger signal fidelity with minimal computational
overhead. We further extend this principle to group-differentiated growth, a
scalable strategy that selectively replicates only the signal-focused heads,
thereby ensuring efficient capacity expansion.
  Through large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments, we
demonstrate that moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial
improvements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines.
Our results collectively establish that ratio-aware head allocation and
selective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing
scalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.

  EuroS&P 2025 conference
DOI: 10.1109/EuroSPW67616.2025.00082
\\
  There are very few SotA deception systems based on Large Language Models. The
existing ones are limited only to simulating one type of service, mainly SSH
shells. These systems - but also the deception technologies not based on LLMs -
lack an extensive evaluation that includes human attackers. Generative AI has
recently become a valuable asset for cybersecurity researchers and
practitioners, and the field of cyber-deception is no exception. Researchers
have demonstrated how LLMs can be leveraged to create realistic-looking
honeytokens, fake users, and even simulated systems that can be used as
honeypots. This paper presents an AI-based deception framework called VelLMes,
which can simulate multiple protocols and services such as SSH Linux shell,
MySQL, POP3, and HTTP. All of these can be deployed and used as honeypots, thus
VelLMes offers a variety of choices for deception design based on the users'
needs. VelLMes is designed to be attacked by humans, so interactivity and
realism are key for its performance. We evaluate the generative capabilities
and the deception capabilities. Generative capabilities were evaluated using
unit tests for LLMs. The results of the unit tests show that, with careful
prompting, LLMs can produce realistic-looking responses, with some LLMs having
a 100% passing rate. In the case of the SSH Linux shell, we evaluated deception
capabilities with 89 human attackers. The results showed that about 30% of the
attackers thought that they were interacting with a real system when they were
assigned an LLM-based honeypot. Lastly, we deployed 10 instances of the SSH
Linux shell honeypot on the Internet to capture real-life attacks. Analysis of
these attacks showed us that LLM honeypots simulating Linux shells can perform
well against unstructured and unexpected attacks on the Internet, responding
correctly to most of the issued commands.

  Many users interact with AI tools like ChatGPT using a mental model that
treats the system as human-like, which we call Model H. According to
goal-setting theory, increased specificity in goals should reduce performance
variance. If Model H holds, then prompting a chatbot with more detailed
instructions should lead to more consistent evaluation behavior.
  This paper tests that assumption through a controlled experiment in which
ChatGPT evaluated 29 student submissions using four prompts with increasing
specificity. We measured consistency using intra-rater reliability (Cohen's
Kappa) across repeated runs.
  Contrary to expectations, performance did not improve consistently with
increased prompt specificity, and performance variance remained largely
unchanged. These findings challenge the assumption that LLMs behave like human
evaluators and highlight the need for greater robustness and improved input
integration in future model development.

Title: Federated Unlearning in the Wild: Rethinking Fairness and Data
  Discrepancy
Authors: ZiHeng Huang, Di Wu, Jun Bai, Jiale Zhang, Sicong Cao, Ji Zhang,

  Machine unlearning is critical for enforcing data deletion rights like the
"right to be forgotten." As a decentralized paradigm, Federated Learning (FL)
also requires unlearning, but realistic implementations face two major
challenges. First, fairness in Federated Unlearning (FU) is often overlooked.
Exact unlearning methods typically force all clients into costly retraining,
even those uninvolved. Approximate approaches, using gradient ascent or
distillation, make coarse interventions that can unfairly degrade performance
for clients with only retained data. Second, most FU evaluations rely on
synthetic data assumptions (IID/non-IID) that ignore real-world heterogeneity.
These unrealistic benchmarks obscure the true impact of unlearning and limit
the applicability of current methods. We first conduct a comprehensive
benchmark of existing FU methods under realistic data heterogeneity and
fairness conditions. We then propose a novel, fairness-aware FU approach,
Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), to explicitly address
both challenges. FedCCCU offers a practical and scalable solution for
real-world FU. Experimental results show that existing methods perform poorly
in realistic settings, while our approach consistently outperforms them.

Title: Unified Molecule Pre-training with Flexible 2D and 3D Modalities: Single
  and Paired Modality Integration
Authors: Tengwei Song, Min Wu, Yuan Fang

  Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing
applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work
leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training,
aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However,
these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model
effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing
limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or
computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose
FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified
molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically,
inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach
employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter
sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate
features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous
learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during
training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior
performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we
also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code
and data are available at https://github.com/tewiSong/FlexMol.

  This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and
robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation
framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed
maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether
the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks
over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present
a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights
consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A
semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent
objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model
learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition,
thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and
structural variations.

  Amid growing efforts to leverage advances in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) for robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
have recently gained significant attention. By unifying vision, language, and
action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA
models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects,
embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to
enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional
task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world
deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action
representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a
comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware
components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic
review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition,
architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and
learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in
real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms,
data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation
methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this
paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying
VLAs to real-world robotic systems. All references categorized by training
approach, evaluation method, modality, and dataset are available in the table

Title: HTMformer: Hybrid Time and Multivariate Transformer for Time Series
  Forecasting
Authors: Tan Wang, Yun Wei Dong, Tao Zhang, Qi Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in time series
forecasting. However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in
sequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This
incurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding
performance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly
dependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To
address this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective
information captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional
embeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations.
These representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand
the series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate
Embeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature
extraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction
module to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between
model complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer
architecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction
capability of the HTME extractor to build a lightweight forecaster. Experiments
conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

  World models are a powerful paradigm in AI and robotics, enabling agents to
reason about the future by predicting visual observations or compact latent
states. The 1X World Model Challenge introduces an open-source benchmark of
real-world humanoid interaction, with two complementary tracks: sampling,
focused on forecasting future image frames, and compression, focused on
predicting future discrete latent codes. For the sampling track, we adapt the
video generation foundation model Wan-2.2 TI2V-5B to video-state-conditioned
future frame prediction. We condition the video generation on robot states
using AdaLN-Zero, and further post-train the model using LoRA. For the
compression track, we train a Spatio-Temporal Transformer model from scratch.
Our models achieve 23.0 dB PSNR in the sampling task and a Top-500 CE of 6.6386
in the compression task, securing 1st place in both challenges.

Title: A Digital Twin Framework for Metamorphic Testing of Autonomous Driving
  Systems Using Generative Model
Authors: Tony Zhang, Burak Kantarci, Umair Siddique
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars remains a major challenge due to the
complexity and unpredictability of real-world driving environments. Traditional
testing methods face significant limitations, such as the oracle problem, which
makes it difficult to determine whether a system's behavior is correct, and the
inability to cover the full range of scenarios an autonomous vehicle may
encounter. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-driven metamorphic
testing framework that addresses these challenges by creating a virtual replica
of the self-driving system and its operating environment. By combining digital
twin technology with AI-based image generative models such as Stable Diffusion,
our approach enables the systematic generation of realistic and diverse driving
scenes. This includes variations in weather, road topology, and environmental
features, all while maintaining the core semantics of the original scenario.
The digital twin provides a synchronized simulation environment where changes
can be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner. Within this environment,
we define three metamorphic relations inspired by real-world traffic rules and
vehicle behavior. We validate our framework in the Udacity self-driving
simulator and demonstrate that it significantly enhances test coverage and
effectiveness. Our method achieves the highest true positive rate (0.719), F1
score (0.689), and precision (0.662) compared to baseline approaches. This
paper highlights the value of integrating digital twins with AI-powered
scenario generation to create a scalable, automated, and high-fidelity testing
solution for autonomous vehicle safety.

\\
  Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) is a fundamental ability that underpins
practical applications, such as companion robots, guidance robots and service
assistants, where continuously following moving targets is essential. Recent
advances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured
scenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and
effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the
presence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we
present TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances
embodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism
and a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a
Chain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative
position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action
prediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update
strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal
consistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive
experiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on
public benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the
challenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading
approach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong
zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and
occluded scenarios.

Title: A Multi-Agent Framework for Stateful Inference-Time Search
Authors: Arshika Lalan, Rajat Ghosh, Aditya Kolsur, Debojyoti Dutta
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL cs.MA cs.SE
\\
  Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured,
multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on
multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,
task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level
code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and
long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful
multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from
prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,
(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of
edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,
where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A
controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary
preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This
yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge
cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent
inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless
single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as
HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,
Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time
state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

Title: ELMUR: External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite for Long-Horizon RL
Authors: Egor Cherepanov, Alexey K. Kovalev, Aleksandr I. Panov
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO
Comments: 22 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Real-world robotic agents must act under partial observability and long
horizons, where key cues may appear long before they affect decision making.
However, most modern approaches rely solely on instantaneous information,
without incorporating insights from the past. Standard recurrent or transformer
models struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies: context
windows truncate history, while naive memory extensions fail under scale and
sparsity. We propose ELMUR (External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite), a
transformer architecture with structured external memory. Each layer maintains
memory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and
updates them through an Least Recently Used (LRU) memory module using
replacement or convex blending. ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000
times beyond the attention window and achieves a 100% success rate on a
synthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it
outperforms baselines on more than half of the tasks. On MIKASA-Robo
sparse-reward manipulation tasks with visual observations, it nearly doubles
the performance of strong baselines. These results demonstrate that structured,
layer-local external memory offers a simple and scalable approach to decision
making under partial observability.

\\
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in spatial
reasoning, yet they remain fundamentally limited to qualitative precision and
lack the computational precision required for real-world robotics. Current
approaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera
calibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks
that cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic
manipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel
framework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric
computers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric
computations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize
complex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to
recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate
computational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To
support this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive
tool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose
estimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification,
complete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design,
TIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while
demonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation
tasks.

  This short essay is a reworking of the answers offered by the author at the
Debate Session of the AIHUB (CSIC) and EduCaixa Summer School, organized by

(OEIAC, UG), with the participation of Vanina Martinez-Posse (IIIA-CSIC),
Eulalia Soler (Eurecat) and Pompeu Casanovas (IIIA-CSIC) on July 4th 2025.
Albert Sabater posed three questions: (1) How can regulatory frameworks
priori-tise the protection of fundamental rights (privacy, non-discrimination,
autonomy, etc.) in the development of AI, without falling into the false
dichotomy between regulation and innova-tion? (2) Given the risks of AI (bias,
mass surveillance, manipulation), what examples of regu-lations or policies
have demonstrated that it is possible to foster responsible innovation, putting
the public interest before profitability, without giving in to competitive
pressure from actors such as China or the US? (3) In a scenario where the US
prioritizes flexibility, what mecha-nisms could ensure that international
cooperation in AI does not become a race to the bottom in rights, but rather a
global standard of accountability? The article attempts to answer these three
questions and concludes with some reflections on the relevance of the answers
for education and research.

\\
  The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance
in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological
structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in
capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates
both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This
paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal
Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these
limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting
hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core
innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism,
implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves
original feature information through residual connections, which is critical
for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity
for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive
experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to
validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming
existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI q-bio.BM q-bio.QM
\\
  Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering
but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space.
Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM)
exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by
interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert
demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this
perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two
complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from
retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints
distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure
representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding
calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational
assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve
state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the
training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm
that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving
robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The
codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

  Processing long-form audio is a major challenge for Large Audio Language
models (LALMs). These models struggle with the quadratic cost of attention
($O(N^2)$) and with modeling long-range temporal dependencies. Existing audio
benchmarks are built mostly from short clips and do not evaluate models in
realistic long context settings. To address this gap, we introduce
AudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and
inference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set
of tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations
ranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of
2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech,
sound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference. We
evaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audio
length grows. We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs
of token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps across
current LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and
memory-efficient architectures. We believe AudioMarathon will drive the audio
and multimodal research community to develop more advanced audio understanding
models capable of solving complex audio tasks.

\\
  Machine learning (ML) models memorize and leak training data, causing serious
privacy issues to data owners. Training algorithms with differential privacy
(DP), such as DP-SGD, have been gaining attention as a solution. However,
DP-SGD adds a noise at each training iteration, which degrades the accuracy of
the trained model. To improve accuracy, a new family of approaches adds
carefully designed correlated noises, so that noises cancel out each other
across iterations. We performed an extensive characterization study of these
new mechanisms, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, and show they
incur non-negligible overheads when the model is large or uses large embedding
tables. Motivated by the analysis, we propose Cocoon, a hardware-software
co-designed framework for efficient training with correlated noises. Cocoon
accelerates models with embedding tables through pre-computing and storing
correlated noises in a coalesced format (Cocoon-Emb), and supports large models
through a custom near-memory processing device (Cocoon-NMP). On a real system
with an FPGA-based NMP device prototype, Cocoon improves the performance by
2.33-10.82x(Cocoon-Emb) and 1.55-3.06x (Cocoon-NMP).

Title: MLE-Smith: Scaling MLE Tasks with Automated Multi-Agent Pipeline
Authors: Rushi Qiang, Yuchen Zhuang, Anikait Singh, Percy Liang, Chao Zhang,

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating
machine learning engineering (MLE), the acquisition of high-quality MLE
training data is significantly constrained. Current MLE benchmarks suffer from
low scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually
curated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We
introduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw
datasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient
generate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality,
real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in
MLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled
with a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and
high-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and
real-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of
real-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories,
objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively
across a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks
shows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on
MLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully
human-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to
scaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.

Title: h1: Bootstrapping LLMs to Reason over Longer Horizons via Reinforcement
  Learning

  Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance
drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this
rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of
which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap
long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon
data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,
multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data
using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in
complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.
Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on
composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,
competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.
Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than
baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning
paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards
achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon
training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1
therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon
problems using only existing data.

  Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable
energy production. A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding
plasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital
for next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the
nonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over
time. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often
employed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However,
they omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D
nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena
neglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent
heat transport.GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D,
(ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent
3D$\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and
the distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation
inspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely
used reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy
cascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three
orders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows
promising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for
scalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.

  Signal-Based Surveillance
DOI: 10.1109/AVSS65446.2025.11149956
\\
  Recent advancements in speech synthesis technologies have led to increasingly
sophisticated spoofing attacks, posing significant challenges for automatic
speaker verification systems. While systems based on self-supervised learning
(SSL) models, particularly the XLSR-Conformer architecture, have demonstrated
remarkable performance in synthetic speech detection, there remains room for
architectural improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
replaces the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in the XLSR-Conformer
model with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a powerful universal approximator
based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Our experimental results
on ASVspoof2021 demonstrate that the integration of KAN to XLSR-Conformer model
can improve the performance by 60.55% relatively in Equal Error Rate (EER) LA
and DF sets, further achieving 0.70% EER on the 21LA set. Besides, the proposed
replacement is also robust to various SSL architectures. These findings suggest
that incorporating KAN into SSL-based models is a promising direction for
advances in synthetic speech detection.

Title: Differentially Private Synthetic Text Generation for Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation (RAG)
Authors: Junki Mori, Kazuya Kakizaki, Taiki Miyagawa, Jun Sakuma
Categories: cs.CR cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: Under review
\\
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
grounding them in external knowledge. However, its application in sensitive
domains is limited by privacy risks. Existing private RAG methods typically
rely on query-time differential privacy (DP), which requires repeated noise
injection and leads to accumulated privacy loss. To address this issue, we
propose DP-SynRAG, a framework that uses LLMs to generate differentially
private synthetic RAG databases. Unlike prior methods, the synthetic text can
be reused once created, thereby avoiding repeated noise injection and
additional privacy costs. To preserve essential information for downstream RAG
tasks, DP-SynRAG extends private prediction, which instructs LLMs to generate
text that mimics subsampled database records in a DP manner. Experiments show
that DP-SynRAG achieves superior performanec to the state-of-the-art private
RAG systems while maintaining a fixed privacy budget, offering a scalable
solution for privacy-preserving RAG.

  We present a quantitative evaluation to understand the effect of zero-shot
large-language model (LLMs) and prompting uses on chart reading tasks. We asked
LLMs to answer 107 visualization questions to compare inference accuracies
between the agentic GPT-5 and multimodal GPT-4V, for difficult image instances,
where GPT-4V failed to produce correct answers. Our results show that model

Title: Exposing Citation Vulnerabilities in Generative Engines
Authors: Riku Mochizuki, Shusuke Komatsu, Souta Noguchi, Kazuto Ataka
Categories: cs.CR cs.CL cs.IR
Comments: 12 pages, under-reviewing at a conference
\\
  We analyze answers generated by generative engines (GEs) from the
perspectives of citation publishers and the content-injection barrier, defined
as the difficulty for attackers to manipulate answers to user prompts by
placing malicious content on the web. GEs integrate two functions: web search
and answer generation that cites web pages using large language models. Because
anyone can publish information on the web, GEs are vulnerable to poisoning
attacks. Existing studies of citation evaluation focus on how faithfully answer
content reflects cited sources, leaving unexamined which web sources should be
selected as citations to defend against poisoning attacks. To fill this gap, we
introduce evaluation criteria that assess poisoning threats using the citation
information contained in answers. Our criteria classify the publisher
attributes of citations to estimate the content-injection barrier thereby
revealing the threat of poisoning attacks in current GEs. We conduct
experiments in political domains in Japan and the United States (U.S.) using
our criteria and show that citations from official party websites (primary
sources) are approximately \(25\%\)--\(45\%\) in the U.S. and
\(60\%\)--\(65\%\) in Japan, indicating that U.S. political answers are at
higher risk of poisoning attacks. We also find that sources with low
content-injection barriers are frequently cited yet are poorly reflected in
answer content. To mitigate this threat, we discuss how publishers of primary
sources can increase exposure of their web content in answers and show that
well-known techniques are limited by language differences.

Title: Crossing Domains without Labels: Distant Supervision for Term Extraction
Authors: Elena Senger, Yuri Campbell, Rob van der Goot, Barbara Plank
Categories: cs.IR cs.CL
Comments: Accepted at EMNLP Industry Track 2025
\\
  Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) is a critical component in downstream NLP
tasks such as document tagging, ontology construction and patent analysis.
Current state-of-the-art methods require expensive human annotation and
struggle with domain transfer, limiting their practical deployment. This
highlights the need for more robust, scalable solutions and realistic
evaluation settings. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark
spanning seven diverse domains, enabling performance evaluation at both the
document- and corpus-levels. Furthermore, we propose a robust LLM-based model
that outperforms both supervised cross-domain encoder models and few-shot
learning baselines and performs competitively with its GPT-4o teacher on this
benchmark. The first step of our approach is generating psuedo-labels with this
black-box LLM on general and scientific domains to ensure generalizability.
Building on this data, we fine-tune the first LLMs for ATE. To further enhance
document-level consistency, oftentimes needed for downstream tasks, we
introduce lightweight post-hoc heuristics. Our approach exceeds previous
approaches on 5/7 domains with an average improvement of 10 percentage points.
We release our dataset and fine-tuned models to support future research in this
area.

  This paper presents the vision, scientific contributions, and technical
details of RedTWIZ: an adaptive and diverse multi-turn red teaming framework,
to audit the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in AI-assisted software
development. Our work is driven by three major research streams: (1) robust and
systematic assessment of LLM conversational jailbreaks; (2) a diverse
generative multi-turn attack suite, supporting compositional, realistic and
goal-oriented jailbreak conversational strategies; and (3) a hierarchical
attack planner, which adaptively plans, serializes, and triggers attacks
tailored to specific LLM's vulnerabilities. Together, these contributions form
a unified framework -- combining assessment, attack generation, and strategic
planning -- to comprehensively evaluate and expose weaknesses in LLMs'
robustness. Extensive evaluation is conducted to systematically assess and
analyze the performance of the overall system and each component. Experimental
results demonstrate that our multi-turn adversarial attack strategies can
successfully lead state-of-the-art LLMs to produce unsafe generations,
highlighting the pressing need for more research into enhancing LLM's
robustness.

Title: Machines in the Crowd? Measuring the Footprint of Machine-Generated Text
  on Reddit
Authors: Lucio La Cava, Luca Maria Aiello, Andrea Tagarelli

\\
  Generative Artificial Intelligence is reshaping online communication by
enabling large-scale production of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) at low cost.
While its presence is rapidly growing across the Web, little is known about how
MGT integrates into social media environments. In this paper, we present the
first large-scale characterization of MGT on Reddit. Using a state-of-the-art
statistical method for detection of MGT, we analyze over two years of activity
(2022-2024) across 51 subreddits representative of Reddit's main community
types such as information seeking, social support, and discussion. We study the
concentration of MGT across communities and over time, and compared MGT to
human-authored text in terms of social signals it expresses and engagement it
receives. Our very conservative estimate of MGT prevalence indicates that
synthetic text is marginally present on Reddit, but it can reach peaks of up to
9% in some communities in some months. MGT is unevenly distributed across
communities, more prevalent in subreddits focused on technical knowledge and
social support, and often concentrated in the activity of a small fraction of
users. MGT also conveys distinct social signals of warmth and status giving
typical of language of AI assistants. Despite these stylistic differences, MGT
achieves engagement levels comparable than human-authored content and in a few
cases even higher, suggesting that AI-generated text is becoming an organic
component of online social discourse. This work offers the first perspective on
the MGT footprint on Reddit, paving the way for new investigations involving
platform governance, detection strategies, and community dynamics.

  Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically
recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate
this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular
convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and
traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones
polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly
from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures
can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to
combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar
diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot
classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between
machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which
enforce rigorous topological distinctions.

Title: Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model-Based Robust MR Image
  Reconstruction from Highly Undersampled Data
Authors: Mohammed Alsubaie, Wenxi Liu, Linxia Gu, Ovidiu C. Andronesi, Sirani

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical tool in modern medical
diagnostics, yet its prolonged acquisition time remains a critical limitation,
especially in time-sensitive clinical scenarios. While undersampling strategies
can accelerate image acquisition, they often result in image artifacts and
degraded quality. Recent diffusion models have shown promise for reconstructing
high-fidelity images from undersampled data by learning powerful image priors;
however, most existing approaches either (i) rely on unsupervised score
functions without paired supervision or (ii) apply data consistency only as a
post-processing step. In this work, we introduce a conditional denoising
diffusion framework with iterative data-consistency correction, which differs
from prior methods by embedding the measurement model directly into every
reverse diffusion step and training the model on paired undersampled-ground
truth data. This hybrid design bridges generative flexibility with explicit
enforcement of MRI physics. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset demonstrate that
our framework consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art deep learning
and diffusion-based methods in SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS, with LPIPS capturing
perceptual improvements more faithfully. These results demonstrate that
integrating conditional supervision with iterative consistency updates yields
substantial improvements in both pixel-level fidelity and perceptual realism,
establishing a principled and practical advance toward robust, accelerated MRI
reconstruction.

Categories: cs.RO cs.CV

  Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires planning methods that
integrate risk aversion with active perception. In this work, we present a
unified framework that refines a coarse reference path by constructing
tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on an
online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field. These maps enable the
generation of locally safe and feasible trajectories. In parallel, we formulate
Next-Best-View (NBV) selection as an optimization problem on the SE(3) pose
manifold, where Riemannian gradient descent maximizes an expected information
gain objective to reduce uncertainty most critical for imminent motion. Our
approach advances the state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement
with NBV planning, while introducing scalable gradient decompositions that
support efficient online updates in complex environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive computational
studies.

  Aerial Robots

Comments: 8 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2026
\\
  Autonomous aerial robots are increasingly being deployed in real-world
scenarios, where transparent obstacles present significant challenges to
reliable navigation and mapping. These materials pose a unique problem for
traditional perception systems because they lack discernible features and can
cause conventional depth sensors to fail, leading to inaccurate maps and
potential collisions. To ensure safe navigation, robots must be able to
accurately detect and map these transparent obstacles. Existing methods often
rely on large, expensive sensors or algorithms that impose high computational
burdens, making them unsuitable for low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) robots.
In this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient framework for
detecting and mapping transparent obstacles onboard a sub-300g quadrotor. Our
method fuses data from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera and an ultrasonic sensor
with a custom, lightweight 2D convolution model. This specialized approach
accurately detects specular reflections and propagates their depth into
corresponding empty regions of the depth map, effectively rendering transparent
obstacles visible. The entire pipeline operates in real-time, utilizing only a
small fraction of a CPU core on an embedded processor. We validate our system
through a series of experiments in both controlled and real-world environments,
demonstrating the utility of our method through experiments where the robot
maps indoor environments containing glass. Our work is, to our knowledge, the
first of its kind to demonstrate a real-time, onboard transparent obstacle
mapping system on a low-SWaP quadrotor using only the CPU.

  Aortic aneurysm disease ranks consistently in the top 20 causes of death in
the U.S. population. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is manifested as an abnormal
bulging of thoracic aortic wall and it is a leading cause of death in adults.
From the perspective of biomechanics, rupture occurs when the stress acting on
the aortic wall exceeds the wall strength. Wall stress distribution can be
obtained by computational biomechanical analyses, especially structural Finite
Element Analysis. For risk assessment, probabilistic rupture risk of TAA can be
calculated by comparing stress with material strength using a material failure
model. Although these engineering tools are currently available for TAA rupture
risk assessment on patient specific level, clinical adoption has been limited
due to two major barriers: labor intensive 3D reconstruction current patient
specific anatomical modeling still relies on manual segmentation, making it
time consuming and difficult to scale to a large patient population, and
computational burden traditional FEA simulations are resource intensive and
incompatible with time sensitive clinical workflows. The second barrier was
successfully overcome by our team through the development of the PyTorch FEA
library and the FEA DNN integration framework. By incorporating the FEA
functionalities within PyTorch FEA and applying the principle of static
determinacy, we reduced the FEA based stress computation time to approximately
three minutes per case. Moreover, by integrating DNN and FEA through the
PyTorch FEA library, our approach further decreases the computation time to
only a few seconds per case. This work focuses on overcoming the first barrier
through the development of an end to end deep neural network capable of
generating patient specific finite element meshes of the aorta directly from 3D
CT images.

\\
  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained increasing attention for their
superior energy efficiency compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
However, their security aspects, particularly under backdoor attacks, have
received limited attention. Existing defense methods developed for ANNs perform
poorly or can be easily bypassed in SNNs due to their event-driven and temporal
dependencies. This paper identifies the key blockers that hinder traditional
backdoor defenses in SNNs and proposes an unsupervised post-training detection
framework, Temporal Membrane Potential Backdoor Detection (TMPBD), to overcome
these challenges. TMPBD leverages the maximum margin statistics of temporal
membrane potential (TMP) in the final spiking layer to detect target labels
without any attack knowledge or data access. We further introduce a robust
mitigation mechanism, Neural Dendrites Suppression Backdoor Mitigation (NDSBM),
which clamps dendritic connections between early convolutional layers to
suppress malicious neurons while preserving benign behaviors, guided by TMP
extracted from a small, clean, unlabeled dataset. Extensive experiments on
multiple neuromorphic benchmarks and state-of-the-art input-aware dynamic
trigger attacks demonstrate that TMPBD achieves 100% detection accuracy, while
NDSBM reduces the attack success rate from 100% to 8.44%, and to 2.81% when
combined with detection, without degrading clean accuracy.

Title: StruSR: Structure-Aware Symbolic Regression with Physics-Informed Taylor
  Guidance
Authors: Yunpeng Gong, Sihan Lan, Can Yang, Kunpeng Xu, Min Jiang
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by
searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system
behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws.
However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical
priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic
expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose
a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages
trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured
physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on
the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural
information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of
expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that
quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical
residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover
operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high
physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less
informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics
residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the
governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN.
Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves
convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability
compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for
physics-grounded symbolic discovery.

Title: UniFField: A Generalizable Unified Neural Feature Field for Visual,

\\
  Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is
crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured
and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is
necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information.
While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to
leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as
language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two
critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack
the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a
unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic,
and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also
predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied
zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into
our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene,
simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty
estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene
reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully
leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active
object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the
capability for robust decision-making.

  In this report, we compare the performance of our UltraGroth-based
zero-knowledge machine learning framework Bionetta to other tools of similar
purpose such as EZKL, Lagrange's deep-prove, or zkml. The results show a
significant boost in the proving time for custom-crafted neural networks: they
can be proven even on mobile devices, enabling numerous client-side proving
applications. While our scheme increases the cost of one-time preprocessing
steps, such as circuit compilation and generating trusted setup, our approach
is, to the best of our knowledge, the only one that is deployable on the native
EVM smart contracts without overwhelming proof size and verification overheads.

Title: Capture and Interact: Rapid 3D Object Acquisition and Rendering with
  Gaussian Splatting in Unity
Authors: Islomjon Shukhratov and Sergey Gorinsky
Categories: cs.GR cs.CV
\\
  Capturing and rendering three-dimensional (3D) objects in real time remain a
significant challenge, yet hold substantial potential for applications in
augmented reality, digital twin systems, remote collaboration and prototyping.
We present an end-to-end pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS)
to enable rapid acquisition and interactive rendering of real-world objects
using a mobile device, cloud processing and a local computer. Users scan an
object with a smartphone video, upload it for automated 3D reconstruction, and
visualize it interactively in Unity at an average of 150 frames per second
(fps) on a laptop. The system integrates mobile capture, cloud-based 3D GS and
Unity rendering to support real-time telepresence. Our experiments show that
the pipeline processes scans in approximately 10 minutes on a graphics
processing unit (GPU) achieving real-time rendering on the laptop.

Title: SaFeR-VLM: Toward Safety-aware Fine-grained Reasoning in Multimodal
  Models
Authors: Huahui Yi, Kun Wang, Qiankun Li, Miao Yu, Liang Lin, Gongli Xi, Hao
  Wu, Xuming Hu, Kang Li, Yang Liu
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal
reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a
phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at
the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models
exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a
safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly
into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I)
QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and
reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations
undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured
reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties
for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which
reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts
safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling
scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further
demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting
dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.
SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and
helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$
larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B.
Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass
GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points
respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any
degradation in helpfulness performance. Our codes are available at

Title: High-Rate Mixout: Revisiting Mixout for Robust Domain Generalization

\\
  Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is
a common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes
with substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store
multiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating
ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to
pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical
representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate
Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to
Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout
mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned
weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby
maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our
study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain
generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9
for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it
yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates
more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting
better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking
substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by
up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five
domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and
DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach,
High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based
methods while significantly reducing training costs.

Title: Revisiting Mixout: An Overlooked Path to Robust Finetuning
Authors: Masih Aminbeidokhti, Heitor Rapela Medeiros, Eric Granger, Marco
  Pedersoli
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Finetuning vision foundation models often improves in-domain accuracy but
comes at the cost of robustness under distribution shift. We revisit Mixout, a
stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with
their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing
implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern
robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and
\emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i)
replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that
adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit
resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates
only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling
training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate
shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet,
iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy
beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong
parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.

Title: Sharpness-Aware Data Generation for Zero-shot Quantization
Authors: Dung Hoang-Anh and Cuong Pham Trung Le and Jianfei Cai and Thanh-Toan
  Do
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained
full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common
idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for
quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural
networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the
previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized
model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a
novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in
synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first
demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient
matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and
real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem
of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with
the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors.
Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in
low-bit quantization settings.

Title: Layerwise Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Quantum Clients using
  Quorus
Authors: Jason Han, Nicholas S. DiBrita, Daniel Leeds, Jianqiang Li, Jason
  Ludmir and Tirthak Patel
Categories: quant-ph cs.DC cs.ET cs.LG
\\
  Quantum machine learning (QML) holds the promise to solve classically
intractable problems, but, as critical data can be fragmented across private
clients, there is a need for distributed QML in a quantum federated learning
(QFL) format. However, the quantum computers that different clients have access
to can be error-prone and have heterogeneous error properties, requiring them
to run circuits of different depths. We propose a novel solution to this QFL
problem, Quorus, that utilizes a layerwise loss function for effective training
of varying-depth quantum models, which allows clients to choose models for
high-fidelity output based on their individual capacity. Quorus also presents
various model designs based on client needs that optimize for shot budget,
qubit count, midcircuit measurement, and optimization space. Our simulation and
real-hardware results show the promise of Quorus: it increases the magnitude of
gradients of higher depth clients and improves testing accuracy by 12.4% on
average over the state-of-the-art.

  Low Power, High Bandwidth, Low Latency and Low Cost Approach
Authors: Debendra Das Sharma, Swadesh Choudhary, Peter Onufryk, and Rob Pelt
Categories: cs.AR cs.DC
Comments: 10 pages
Journal-ref: 2025 Hot Interconnects
\\
  Emerging computing applications such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) are
facing a memory wall with existing on-package memory solutions that are unable
to meet the power-efficient bandwidth demands. We propose to enhance UCIe with
memory semantics to deliver power-efficient bandwidth and cost-effective
on-package memory solutions applicable across the entire computing continuum.
We propose approaches by reusing existing LPDDR6 and HBM memory through a logic
die that connects to the SoC using UCIe. We also propose an approach where the
DRAM die natively supports UCIe instead of the LPDDR6 bus interface. Our
approaches result in significantly higher bandwidth density (up to 10x), lower
latency (up to 3x), lower power (up to 3x), and lower cost compared to existing
HBM4 and LPDDR on-package memory solutions.

Title: Vectorized FlashAttention with Low-cost Exponential Computation in
  RISC-V Vector Processors
Authors: Vasileios Titopoulos, Kosmas Alexandridis, Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC cs.PF
\\
  Attention is a core operation in numerous machine learning and artificial
intelligence models. This work focuses on the acceleration of attention kernel
using FlashAttention algorithm, in vector processors, particularly those based
on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). This work represents the
first effort to vectorize FlashAttention, minimizing scalar code and
simplifying the computational complexity of evaluating exponentials needed by
softmax used in attention. By utilizing a low-cost approximation for
exponentials in floating-point arithmetic, we reduce the cost of computing the
exponential function without the need to extend baseline vector ISA with new
custom instructions. Also, appropriate tiling strategies are explored with the
goal to improve memory locality. Experimental results highlight the scalability
of our approach, demonstrating significant performance gains with the
vectorized implementations when processing attention layers in practical
applications.

Title: DPMM-CFL: Clustered Federated Learning via Dirichlet Process Mixture
  Model Nonparametric Clustering
Authors: Mariona Jaramillo-Civill, Peng Wu, Pau Closas
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC stat.ML
Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client
heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby
balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most
CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is
impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL
algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of
cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly
infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing
per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each
round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in
this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet
and class-split non-IID partitions.

Title: Three-dimensional Integrated Guidance and Control for Leader-Follower
  Flexible Formation of Fixed Wing UAVs
Authors: Praveen Kumar Ranjan, Abhinav Sinha, and Yongcan Cao
Categories: eess.SY cs.MA cs.RO cs.SY math.DS
\\
  This paper presents a nonlinear integrated guidance and control (IGC)
approach for flexible leader-follower formation flight of fixed-wing unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) while accounting for high-fidelity aerodynamics and
thrust dynamics. Unlike conventional leader-follower schemes that fix the
follower's position relative to the leader, the follower is steered to maintain
range and bearing angles (which is the angle between its velocity vector and
its line-of-sight (LOS) with respect to the leader) arbitrarily close to the
prescribed values, enabling the follower to maintain formation on a
hemispherical region behind the leader. The proposed IGC framework directly
maps leader-follower relative range dynamics to throttle commands, and the
follower's velocity orientation relative to the LOS to aerodynamic control
surface deflections. This enables synergism between guidance and control
subsystems. The control design uses a dynamic surface control-based
backstepping approach to achieve convergence to the desired formation set,
where Lyapunov barrier functions are incorporated to ensure the follower's
bearing angle is constrained within specified bounds. Rigorous stability
analysis guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all error states and strict
constraint satisfaction in the presence of aerodynamic nonlinearities. The
proposed flexible formation scheme allows the follower to have an orientation
mismatch relative to the leader to execute anticipatory reconfiguration by
transitioning between the relative positions in the admissible formation set
when the leader aggressively maneuvers. The proposed IGC law relies only on
relative information and onboard sensors without the information about the
leader's maneuver, making it suitable for GPS-denied or non-cooperative
scenarios. Finally, we present simulation results to vindicate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach.
