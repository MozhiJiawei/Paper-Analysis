Title: Unified Crew Planning and Replanning Optimization in Multi-Line Metro
  Systems Considering Workforce Heterogeneity
Authors: Qihang Chen
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Metro crew planning is a key component of smart city development as it
directly impacts the operational efficiency and service reliability of public
transportation. With the rapid expansion of metro networks, effective
multi-line scheduling and emergency management have become essential for
large-scale seamless operations. However, current research focuses primarily on
individual metro lines,with insufficient attention on cross-line coordination
and rapid replanning during disruptions. Here, a unified optimization framework
is presented for multi-line metro crew planning and replanning with
heterogeneous workforce. Specifically, a hierarchical time-space network model
is proposed to represent the unified crew action space, and computationally
efficient constraints and formulations are derived for the crew's heterogeneous
qualifications and preferences. Solution algorithms based on column generation
and shortest path adjustment are further developed, utilizing the proposed
network model. Experiments with real data from Shanghai and Beijing Metro
demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform benchmark heuristics in both
cost reduction and task completion,and achieve notable efficiency gains by
incorporating cross-line operations, particularly for urgent tasks during
disruptions. This work highlights the role of global optimization and
cross-line coordination in multi-line metro system operations, providing
insights into the efficient and reliable functioning of public transportation
in smart cities.

Title: From Capabilities to Performance: Evaluating Key Functional Properties
  of LLM Architectures in Penetration Testing
Authors: Lanxiao Huang, Daksh Dave, Ming Jin, Tyler Cody, and Peter Beling
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate or augment
penetration testing, but their effectiveness and reliability across attack
phases remain unclear. We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple
LLM-based agents, from single-agent to modular designs, across realistic
penetration testing scenarios, measuring empirical performance and recurring
failure patterns. We also isolate the impact of five core functional
capabilities via targeted augmentations: Global Context Memory (GCM),
Inter-Agent Messaging (IAM), Context-Conditioned Invocation (CCI), Adaptive
Planning (AP), and Real-Time Monitoring (RTM). These interventions support,
respectively: (i) context coherence and retention, (ii) inter-component
coordination and state management, (iii) tool use accuracy and selective
execution, (iv) multi-step strategic planning, error detection, and recovery,
and (v) real-time dynamic responsiveness. Our results show that while some
architectures natively exhibit subsets of these properties, targeted
augmentations substantially improve modular agent performance, especially in
complex, multi-step, and real-time penetration testing tasks.

Title: Detecting Pipeline Failures through Fine-Grained Analysis of Web Agents
Authors: Daniel R\"oder, Akhil Juneja, Roland Roller, Sven Schmeier
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can autonomously perform
complex, multistep tasks in dynamic web environments. However, current
evaluations mostly focus on the overall success while overlooking intermediate
errors. This limits insight into failure modes and hinders systematic
improvement. This work analyzes existing benchmarks and highlights the lack of
fine-grained diagnostic tools. To address this gap, we propose a modular
evaluation framework that decomposes agent pipelines into interpretable stages
for detailed error analysis. Using the SeeAct framework and the Mind2Web
dataset as a case study, we show how this approach reveals actionable
weaknesses missed by standard metrics - paving the way for more robust and
generalizable web agents.

  Benchmarks such as SWE-bench and ARC-AGI demonstrate how shared datasets
accelerate progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). We introduce
VCBench, the first benchmark for predicting founder success in venture capital
(VC), a domain where signals are sparse, outcomes are uncertain, and even top
investors perform modestly. At inception, the market index achieves a precision
of 1.9%. Y Combinator outperforms the index by a factor of 1.7x, while tier-1
firms are 2.9x better. VCBench provides 9,000 anonymized founder profiles,
standardized to preserve predictive features while resisting identity leakage,
with adversarial tests showing more than 90% reduction in re-identification
risk. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs).
DeepSeek-V3 delivers over six times the baseline precision, GPT-4o achieves the
highest F0.5, and most models surpass human benchmarks. Designed as a public
and evolving resource available at vcbench.com, VCBench establishes a
community-driven standard for reproducible and privacy-preserving evaluation of
AGI in early-stage venture forecasting.

Title: From Mimicry to True Intelligence (TI) - A New Paradigm for Artificial
  General Intelligence
Authors: Meltem Subasioglu, Nevzat Subasioglu
Categories: cs.AI cs.CY
Comments: 27 pages, 1 figure
\\
  The debate around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains open due to
two fundamentally different goals: replicating human-like performance versus
replicating human-like cognitive processes. We argue that current
performance-based definitions are inadequate because they provide no clear,
mechanism-focused roadmap for research, and they fail to properly define the
qualitative nature of genuine intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the human
brain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to
the development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True
Intelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied
sensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a
highly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and
lastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize
results in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical,
five-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable
components a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with
developmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building
genuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5
AGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it
and TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and
given theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated,
higher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and
practically equivalent to TI. This work synthesizes diverse insights from
analytical psychology, schema theory, metacognition, modern brain architectures
and latest works in AI to provide the first holistic, mechanism-based
definition of AGI that offers a clear and actionable path for the research
community.

Title: Beyond the high score: Prosocial ability profiles of multi-agent
  populations
Authors: Marko Tesic, Yue Zhao, Joel Z. Leibo, Rakshit S. Trivedi, Jose
  Hernandez-Orallo
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The development and evaluation of social capabilities in AI agents require
complex environments where competitive and cooperative behaviours naturally
emerge. While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent
populations outperform others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention
following, are harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The
Melting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the
cooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian
approach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of
multi-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability
profiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but
also reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis
indicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with
better performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents
exhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that
top-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in
scenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings,
together with reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution
tailored to specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing
team may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary,
potentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework. We provide
recommendations for improving the annotation of cooperation demands and propose
future research directions to account for biases introduced by different
testing environments. Our results demonstrate that Measurement Layouts offer
both strong predictive accuracy and actionable insights, contributing to a more
transparent and generalisable approach to evaluating AI systems in complex
social settings.

Title: DeKeyNLU: Enhancing Natural Language to SQL Generation through Task
  Decomposition and Keyword Extraction
Authors: Jian Chen, Zhenyan Chen, Xuming Hu, Peilin Zhou, Yining Hua, Han Fang,
  Cissy Hing Yee Choy, Xinmei Ke, Jingfeng Luo, Zixuan Yuan
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) provides a new model-centric paradigm that
simplifies database access for non-technical users by converting natural
language queries into SQL commands. Recent advancements, particularly those
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, have made significant strides in enhancing NL2SQL performance.
However, challenges such as inaccurate task decomposition and keyword
extraction by LLMs remain major bottlenecks, often leading to errors in SQL
generation. While existing datasets aim to mitigate these issues by fine-tuning
models, they struggle with over-fragmentation of tasks and lack of
domain-specific keyword annotations, limiting their effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we present DeKeyNLU, a novel dataset which contains 1,500
meticulously annotated QA pairs aimed at refining task decomposition and
enhancing keyword extraction precision for the RAG pipeline. Fine-tuned with
DeKeyNLU, we propose DeKeySQL, a RAG-based NL2SQL pipeline that employs three
distinct modules for user question understanding, entity retrieval, and
generation to improve SQL generation accuracy. We benchmarked multiple model
configurations within DeKeySQL RAG pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate
that fine-tuning with DeKeyNLU significantly improves SQL generation accuracy
on both BIRD (62.31% to 69.10%) and Spider (84.2% to 88.7%) dev datasets.

Title: Rationality Check! Benchmarking the Rationality of Large Language Models
Authors: Zhilun Zhou, Jing Yi Wang, Nicholas Sukiennik, Chen Gao, Fengli Xu,
  Yong Li, James Evans
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs), a recent advance in deep learning and machine
intelligence, have manifested astonishing capacities, now considered among the
most promising for artificial general intelligence. With human-like
capabilities, LLMs have been used to simulate humans and serve as AI assistants
across many applications. As a result, great concern has arisen about whether
and under what circumstances LLMs think and behave like real human agents.
Rationality is among the most important concepts in assessing human behavior,
both in thinking (i.e., theoretical rationality) and in taking action (i.e.,
practical rationality). In this work, we propose the first benchmark for
evaluating the omnibus rationality of LLMs, covering a wide range of domains
and LLMs. The benchmark includes an easy-to-use toolkit, extensive experimental
results, and analysis that illuminates where LLMs converge and diverge from
idealized human rationality. We believe the benchmark can serve as a
foundational tool for both developers and users of LLMs.

Title: (P)rior(D)yna(F)low: A Priori Dynamic Workflow Construction via
  Multi-Agent Collaboration
Authors: Yi Lin and Lujin Zhao and Yijie Shi
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Recent studies have shown that carefully designed workflows coordinating
large language models(LLMs) significantly enhance task-solving capabilities
compared to using a single model. While an increasing number of works focus on
autonomous workflow construction, most existing approaches rely solely on
historical experience, leading to limitations in efficiency and adaptability.
We argue that while historical experience is valuable, workflow construction
should also flexibly respond to the unique characteristics of each task. To
this end, we propose an a priori dynamic framework for automated workflow
construction. Our framework first leverages Q-table learning to optimize the
decision space, guiding agent decisions and enabling effective use of
historical experience. At the same time, agents evaluate the current task
progress and make a priori decisions regarding the next executing agent,
allowing the system to proactively select the more suitable workflow structure
for each given task. Additionally, we incorporate mechanisms such as cold-start
initialization, early stopping, and pruning to further improve system
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.05%, while reducing
workflow construction and inference costs to only 30.68%-48.31% of those
required by existing methods.

  Data-driven decision support in high-stakes domains like healthcare and
finance faces significant barriers to data sharing due to regulatory,
institutional, and privacy concerns. While recent generative AI models, such as
large language models, have shown impressive performance in open-domain tasks,
their adoption in sensitive environments remains limited by unpredictable
behaviors and insufficient privacy-preserving datasets for benchmarking.
Existing anonymization methods are often inadequate, especially for
unstructured text, as redaction and masking can still allow re-identification.
Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled alternative, enabling the
generation of synthetic data with formal privacy assurances. In this work, we
address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework with standardized utility and fidelity
metrics, encompassing nine curated datasets that capture domain-specific
complexities such as technical jargon, long-context dependencies, and
specialized document structures. Second, we conduct a large-scale empirical
study benchmarking state-of-the-art DP text generation methods and LLMs of
varying sizes and different fine-tuning strategies, revealing that high-quality
domain-specific synthetic data generation under DP constraints remains an
unsolved challenge, with performance degrading as domain complexity increases.
Third, we develop a membership inference attack (MIA) methodology tailored for
synthetic text, providing first empirical evidence that the use of public
datasets - potentially present in pre-training corpora - can invalidate claimed
privacy guarantees. Our findings underscore the urgent need for rigorous
privacy auditing and highlight persistent gaps between open-domain and
specialist evaluations, informing responsible deployment of generative AI in
privacy-sensitive, high-stakes settings.

Title: AgentCompass: Towards Reliable Evaluation of Agentic Workflows in
  Production
Authors: NVJK Kartik, Garvit Sapra, Rishav Hada, Nikhil Pareek
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating
complex, multi-agent workflows, organizations face mounting risks from errors,
emergent behaviors, and systemic failures that current evaluation methods fail
to capture. We present AgentCompass, the first evaluation framework designed
specifically for post-deployment monitoring and debugging of agentic workflows.
AgentCompass models the reasoning process of expert debuggers through a
structured, multi-stage analytical pipeline: error identification and
categorization, thematic clustering, quantitative scoring, and strategic
summarization. The framework is further enhanced with a dual memory
system-episodic and semantic-that enables continual learning across executions.
Through collaborations with design partners, we demonstrate the framework's
practical utility on real-world deployments, before establishing its efficacy
against the publicly available TRAIL benchmark. AgentCompass achieves
state-of-the-art results on key metrics, while uncovering critical issues
missed in human annotations, underscoring its role as a robust,
developer-centric tool for reliable monitoring and improvement of agentic
systems in production.

  While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate extensive chain-of-thought
reasoning, we lack a principled framework for understanding how these thoughts
are structured. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach by applying
Schoenfeld's Episode Theory, a classic cognitive framework for human
mathematical problem-solving, to analyze the reasoning traces of LRMs. We
annotated thousands of sentences and paragraphs from model-generated solutions
to math problems using seven cognitive labels (e.g., Plan, Implement, Verify).
The result is the first publicly available benchmark for the fine-grained
analysis of machine reasoning, including a large annotated corpus and detailed
annotation guidebooks. Our preliminary analysis reveals distinct patterns in
LRM reasoning, such as the transition dynamics between cognitive states. This
framework provides a theoretically grounded methodology for interpreting LRM
cognition and enables future work on more controllable and transparent
reasoning systems.

  Logs constitute a form of evidence signaling the operational status of
software systems. Automated log anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the
reliability of modern software systems. However, existing approaches face
significant limitations: traditional deep learning models lack interpretability
and generalization, while methods leveraging Large Language Models are often
hindered by unreliability and factual inaccuracies. To address these issues, we
propose RationAnomaly, a novel framework that enhances log anomaly detection by
synergizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning with reinforcement learning. Our
approach first instills expert-like reasoning patterns using CoT-guided
supervised fine-tuning, grounded in a high-quality dataset corrected through a
rigorous expert-driven process. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning phase
with a multi-faceted reward function optimizes for accuracy and logical
consistency, effectively mitigating hallucinations. Experimentally,
RationAnomaly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior
F1-scores on key benchmarks while providing transparent, step-by-step
analytical outputs. We have released the corresponding resources, including
code and datasets.

\\
  Benchmark saturation and contamination undermine confidence in LLM
evaluation. We present Nazonazo, a cost-effective and extensible benchmark
built from Japanese children's riddles to test insight-based reasoning. Items
are short (mostly one sentence), require no specialized domain knowledge, and
can be generated at scale, enabling rapid refresh of blind sets when leakage is
suspected. We evaluate 38 frontier models and 126 adults on 120 riddles. No
model except for GPT-5 is comparable to human performance, which achieves a
52.9% mean accuracy. Model comparison on extended 201 items shows that
reasoning models significantly outperform non-reasoning peers, while model size
shows no reliable association with accuracy. Beyond aggregate accuracy, an
informal candidate-tracking analysis of thought logs reveals many cases of
verification failure: models often produce the correct solution among
intermediate candidates yet fail to select it as the final answer, which we
illustrate with representative examples observed in multiple models. Nazonazo
thus offers a cost-effective, scalable, and easily renewable benchmark format
that addresses the current evaluation crisis while also suggesting a recurrent
meta-cognitive weakness, providing clear targets for future control and
calibration methods.

Title: Enhancing Retrieval Augmentation via Adversarial Collaboration
Authors: Letian Zhang, Guanghao Meng, Xudong Ren, Yiming Wang, Shu-Tao Xia
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for
domain-specific LLMs, yet it is often plagued by "Retrieval Hallucinations"--a
phenomenon where fine-tuned models fail to recognize and act upon poor-quality
retrieved documents, thus undermining performance. To address this, we propose
the Adversarial Collaboration RAG (AC-RAG) framework. AC-RAG employs two
heterogeneous agents: a generalist Detector that identifies knowledge gaps, and
a domain-specialized Resolver that provides precise solutions. Guided by a
moderator, these agents engage in an adversarial collaboration, where the
Detector's persistent questioning challenges the Resolver's expertise. This
dynamic process allows for iterative problem dissection and refined knowledge
retrieval. Extensive experiments show that AC-RAG significantly improves
retrieval accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods across various
vertical domains.

Title: OpenLens AI: Fully Autonomous Research Agent for Health Infomatics
Authors: Yuxiao Cheng, Jinli Suo
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA
\\
  Health informatics research is characterized by diverse data modalities,
rapid knowledge expansion, and the need to integrate insights across biomedical
science, data analytics, and clinical practice. These characteristics make it
particularly well-suited for agent-based approaches that can automate knowledge
exploration, manage complex workflows, and generate clinically meaningful
outputs. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has
demonstrated promising capabilities in literature synthesis, data analysis, and
even end-to-end research execution. However, existing systems remain limited
for health informatics because they lack mechanisms to interpret medical
visualizations and often overlook domain-specific quality requirements. To
address these gaps, we introduce OpenLens AI, a fully automated framework
tailored to health informatics. OpenLens AI integrates specialized agents for
literature review, data analysis, code generation, and manuscript preparation,
enhanced by vision-language feedback for medical visualization and quality
control for reproducibility. The framework automates the entire research
pipeline, producing publication-ready LaTeX manuscripts with transparent and
traceable workflows, thereby offering a domain-adapted solution for advancing
health informatics research.

  Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriace poses a critical concern for
infection prevention and control in hospitals. However, predictive modeling of
previously highlighted CPE-associated risks such as readmission, mortality, and
extended length of stay (LOS) remains underexplored, particularly with modern
deep learning approaches. This study introduces an eXplainable AI modeling
framework to investigate CPE impact on patient outcomes from Electronic Medical
Records data of an Irish hospital. We analyzed an inpatient dataset from an
Irish acute hospital, incorporating diagnostic codes, ward transitions, patient
demographics, infection-related variables and contact network features. Several
Transformer-based architectures were benchmarked alongside traditional machine
learning models. Clinical outcomes were predicted, and XAI techniques were
applied to interpret model decisions. Our framework successfully demonstrated
the utility of Transformer-based models, with TabTransformer consistently
outperforming baselines across multiple clinical prediction tasks, especially
for CPE acquisition (AUROC and sensitivity). We found infection-related
features, including historical hospital exposure, admission context, and
network centrality measures, to be highly influential in predicting patient
outcomes and CPE acquisition risk. Explainability analyses revealed that
features like "Area of Residence", "Admission Ward" and prior admissions are
key risk factors. Network variables like "Ward PageRank" also ranked highly,
reflecting the potential value of structural exposure information. This study
presents a robust and explainable AI framework for analyzing complex EMR data
to identify key risk factors and predict CPE-related outcomes. Our findings
underscore the superior performance of the Transformer models and highlight the
importance of diverse clinical and network features.

Title: Sentinel Agents for Secure and Trustworthy Agentic AI in Multi-Agent
  Systems
Authors: Diego Gosmar, Deborah A. Dahl
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA
Comments: 25 pages, 12 figures
\\
  This paper proposes a novel architectural framework aimed at enhancing
security and reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS). A central component of
this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed
security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large
language models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification,
and cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee
inter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and
access controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the
idea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator
Agent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In
addition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on
these alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,
and contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This
dual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel
Agents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic
and adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt
injection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy
breaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural
design, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different
families (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected
into a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully
detected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the
proposed monitoring approach. The framework also offers enhanced system
observability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution
over time.

Title: Set Contribution Functions for Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation and
  their Principles

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  We present functions that quantify the contribution of a set of arguments in
quantitative bipolar argumentation graphs to (the final strength of) an
argument of interest, a so-called topic. Our set contribution functions are
generalizations of existing functions that quantify the contribution of a
single contributing argument to a topic. Accordingly, we generalize existing
contribution function principles for set contribution functions and provide a
corresponding principle-based analysis. We introduce new principles specific to
set-based functions that focus on properties pertaining to the interaction of
arguments within a set. Finally, we sketch how the principles play out across
different set contribution functions given a recommendation system application
scenario.

\\
  Medical decision-making often involves integrating knowledge from multiple
clinical specialties, typically achieved through multidisciplinary teams.
Inspired by this collaborative process, recent work has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) in multi-agent collaboration frameworks to emulate
expert teamwork. While these approaches improve reasoning through agent
interaction, they are limited by static, pre-assigned roles, which hinder
adaptability and dynamic knowledge integration. To address these limitations,
we propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration
framework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams
based on the evolving diagnostic context. KAMAC begins with one or more expert
agents and then conducts a knowledge-driven discussion to identify and fill
knowledge gaps by recruiting additional specialists as needed. This supports
flexible, scalable collaboration in complex clinical scenarios, with decisions
finalized through reviewing updated agent comments. Experiments on two
real-world medical benchmarks demonstrate that KAMAC significantly outperforms
both single-agent and advanced multi-agent methods, particularly in complex
clinical scenarios (i.e., cancer prognosis) requiring dynamic, cross-specialty
expertise. Our code is publicly available at:

Title: Calibrated Generative AI as Meta-Reviewer: A Systemic Functional
  Linguistics Discourse Analysis of Reviews of Peer Reviews

Comments: 39 pages, 3 tables
\\
  This study investigates the use of generative AI to support formative
assessment through machine generated reviews of peer reviews in graduate online
courses in a public university in the United States. Drawing on Systemic
Functional Linguistics and Appraisal Theory, we analyzed 120 metareviews to
explore how generative AI feedback constructs meaning across ideational,
interpersonal, and textual dimensions. The findings suggest that generative AI
can approximate key rhetorical and relational features of effective human
feedback, offering directive clarity while also maintaining a supportive
stance. The reviews analyzed demonstrated a balance of praise and constructive
critique, alignment with rubric expectations, and structured staging that
foregrounded student agency. By modeling these qualities, AI metafeedback has
the potential to scaffold feedback literacy and enhance leaner engagement with
peer review.

  As autonomous technologies increasingly shape maritime operations,
understanding why an AI system makes a decision becomes as crucial as what it
decides. In complex and dynamic maritime environments, trust in AI depends not
only on performance but also on transparency and interpretability. This paper
highlights the importance of Explainable AI (XAI) as a foundation for effective
human-machine teaming in the maritime domain, where informed oversight and
shared understanding are essential. To support the user-centered integration of
XAI, we propose a domain-specific survey designed to capture maritime
professionals' perceptions of trust, usability, and explainability. Our aim is
to foster awareness and guide the development of user-centric XAI systems
tailored to the needs of seafarers and maritime teams.

  Alignment
Authors: Ankur Samanta, Akshayaa Magesh, Youliang Yu, Runzhe Wu, Ayush Jain,

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Language Models (LMs) are inconsistent reasoners, often generating
contradictory responses to identical prompts. While inference-time methods can
mitigate these inconsistencies, they fail to address the core problem: LMs
struggle to reliably select reasoning pathways leading to consistent outcomes
under exploratory sampling. To address this, we formalize self-consistency as
an intrinsic property of well-aligned reasoning models and introduce
Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment (MACA), a reinforcement learning framework that
post-trains models to favor reasoning trajectories aligned with their internal
consensus using majority/minority outcomes from multi-agent debate. These
trajectories emerge from deliberative exchanges where agents ground reasoning
in peer arguments, not just aggregation of independent attempts, creating
richer consensus signals than single-round majority voting. MACA enables agents
to teach themselves to be more decisive and concise, and better leverage peer
insights in multi-agent settings without external supervision, driving
substantial improvements across self-consistency (+27.6% on GSM8K),
single-agent reasoning (+23.7% on MATH), sampling-based inference (+22.4%
Pass@20 on MATH), and multi-agent ensemble decision-making (+42.7% on MathQA).
These findings, coupled with strong generalization to unseen benchmarks (+16.3%
on GPQA, +11.6% on CommonsenseQA), demonstrate robust self-alignment that more
reliably unlocks latent reasoning potential of language models.

Title: Generalizable Geometric Image Caption Synthesis
Authors: Yue Xin, Wenyuan Wang, Rui Pan, Ruida Wang, Howard Meng, Renjie Pi,
  Shizhe Diao and Tong Zhang
Categories: cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Multimodal large language models have various practical applications that
demand strong reasoning abilities. Despite recent advancements, these models
still struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from
the lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric
images. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically
fail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this
paper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation
pipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized
from 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from
mathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key
features of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization
and yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution
scenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of
$2.8\%\text{-}4.8\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks
with non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with
$2.4\%\text{-}3.9\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks
in MMMU.

  Word2Vec: Case Study on Turkish and Finnish
Authors: Jinfan Frank Hu

Comments: 6 pages, 9 figures, accepted to ACDSA 2025, to be indexed in IEEE
  Xplore
\\
  Tokenization plays a critical role in processing agglutinative languages,
where a single word can encode multiple morphemes carrying syntactic and
semantic information. This study evaluates the impact of various tokenization
strategies - word-level, character-level, n-gram, and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
- on the quality of static word embeddings generated by Word2Vec for Turkish
and Finnish. Using a 10,000-article Wikipedia corpus, we trained models under
low-resource conditions and evaluated them on a Named Entity Recognition (NER)
task. Despite the theoretical appeal of subword segmentation, word-level
tokenization consistently outperformed all alternatives across all tokenization
strategies tested. These findings suggest that in agglutinative, low-resource
contexts, preserving boundaries via word-level tokenization may yield better
embedding performance than complex statistical methods. This has practical
implications for developing NLP pipelines for under-resourced languages where
annotated data and computing power are limited.

Title: Advancing Conversational AI with Shona Slang: A Dataset and Hybrid Model
  for Digital Inclusion
Authors: Happymore Masoka
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  African languages remain underrepresented in natural language processing
(NLP), with most corpora limited to formal registers that fail to capture the
vibrancy of everyday communication. This work addresses this gap for Shona, a
Bantu language spoken in Zimbabwe and Zambia, by introducing a novel
Shona--English slang dataset curated from anonymized social media
conversations. The dataset is annotated for intent, sentiment, dialogue acts,
code-mixing, and tone, and is publicly available at
https://github.com/HappymoreMasoka/Working_with_shona-slang. We fine-tuned a
multilingual DistilBERT classifier for intent recognition, achieving 96.4\%
accuracy and 96.3\% F1-score, hosted at https://huggingface.co/HappymoreMasoka.
This classifier is integrated into a hybrid chatbot that combines rule-based
responses with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to handle domain-specific
queries, demonstrated through a use case assisting prospective students with
graduate program information at Pace University. Qualitative evaluation shows
the hybrid system outperforms a RAG-only baseline in cultural relevance and
user engagement. By releasing the dataset, model, and methodology, this work
advances NLP resources for African languages, promoting inclusive and
culturally resonant conversational AI.

Title: The meaning of prompts and the prompts of meaning: Semiotic reflections
  and modelling
Authors: Martin Thellefsen, Amalia Nurma Dewi and Bent Sorensen
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 22 pages, 2 figures
\\
  This paper explores prompts and prompting in large language models (LLMs) as
dynamic semiotic phenomena, drawing on Peirce's triadic model of signs, his
nine sign types, and the Dynacom model of communication. The aim is to
reconceptualize prompting not as a technical input mechanism but as a
communicative and epistemic act involving an iterative process of sign
formation, interpretation, and refinement. The theoretical foundation rests on
Peirce's semiotics, particularly the interplay between representamen, object,
and interpretant, and the typological richness of signs: qualisign, sinsign,
legisign; icon, index, symbol; rheme, dicent, argument - alongside the
interpretant triad captured in the Dynacom model. Analytically, the paper
positions the LLM as a semiotic resource that generates interpretants in
response to user prompts, thereby participating in meaning-making within shared
universes of discourse. The findings suggest that prompting is a semiotic and
communicative process that redefines how knowledge is organized, searched,
interpreted, and co-constructed in digital environments. This perspective
invites a reimagining of the theoretical and methodological foundations of
knowledge organization and information seeking in the age of computational
semiosis

Title: LLM-JEPA: Large Language Models Meet Joint Embedding Predictive
  Architectures
Authors: Hai Huang, Yann LeCun, Randall Balestriero
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining, finetuning, and evaluation rely on
input-space reconstruction and generative capabilities. Yet, it has been
observed in vision that embedding-space training objectives, e.g., with Joint
Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), are far superior to their
input-space counterpart. That mismatch in how training is achieved between
language and vision opens up a natural question: {\em can language training
methods learn a few tricks from the vision ones?} The lack of JEPA-style LLM is
a testimony of the challenge in designing such objectives for language. In this
work, we propose a first step in that direction where we develop LLM-JEPA, a
JEPA based solution for LLMs applicable both to finetuning and pretraining.
Thus far, LLM-JEPA is able to outperform the standard LLM training objectives
by a significant margin across models, all while being robust to overfiting.
Those findings are observed across numerous datasets (NL-RX, GSM8K, Spider,
RottenTomatoes) and various models from the Llama3, OpenELM, Gemma2 and Olmo
families. Code: https://github.com/rbalestr-lab/llm-jepa.

Title: CrossPT: Exploring Cross-Task Transferability through Multi-Task Prompt
  Tuning
Authors: Ahmad Pouramini and Hesham Faili
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient way to adapt large pre-trained
language models to new tasks, but most existing approaches are designed for
single-task settings, failing to share knowledge across related tasks. We
propose Cross-task Prompt Tuning (CrossPT), a modular framework for multi-task
prompt tuning that enables controlled knowledge transfer while maintaining
task-specific specialization. CrossPT decomposes each target prompt into
shared, pre-trained source prompts and task-specific private prompts, combined
via a learned attention mechanism. To support robust transfer, we
systematically investigate key design factors including prompt initialization,
balancing shared and private prompts, number of source prompts, learning rates,
task prefixes, and label semantics. Empirical results on GLUE and related
benchmarks show that CrossPT achieves higher accuracy and robustness compared
to traditional prompt tuning and related methods, particularly in low-resource
scenarios, while maintaining strong parameter efficiency.

Title: Hallucination Detection with the Internal Layers of LLMs
Authors: Martin Prei{\ss}
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Master's thesis
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded in a variety of natural language
processing tasks [Zha+25]. However, they have notable limitations. LLMs tend to
generate hallucinations, a seemingly plausible yet factually unsupported output
[Hua+24], which have serious real-world consequences [Kay23; Rum+24]. Recent
work has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal
representations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24;
SMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can
enhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.
  Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for
hallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them
across three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact. Specifically, a new
architecture that dynamically weights and combines internal LLM layers was
developed to improve hallucination detection performance. Throughout extensive
experiments, two key findings were obtained: First, the proposed approach was
shown to achieve superior performance compared to traditional probing methods,
though generalization across benchmarks and LLMs remains challenging. Second,
these generalization limitations were demonstrated to be mitigated through
cross-benchmark training and parameter freezing. While not consistently
improving, both techniques yielded better performance on individual benchmarks
and reduced performance degradation when transferred to other benchmarks. These
findings open new avenues for improving LLM reliability through internal
representation analysis.

Title: Opening the Black Box: Interpretable LLMs via Semantic Resonance
  Architecture

  https://github.com/ITernovtsii/semantic-resonance. Preprint
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain
difficult to interpret. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve efficiency
through sparse activation, yet typically rely on opaque, learned gating
functions. While similarity-based routing (Cosine Routers) has been explored
for training stabilization, its potential for inherent interpretability remains
largely untapped. We introduce the Semantic Resonance Architecture (SRA), an
MoE approach designed to ensure that routing decisions are inherently
interpretable. SRA replaces learned gating with a Chamber of Semantic Resonance
(CSR) module, which routes tokens based on cosine similarity with trainable
semantic anchors. We also introduce a novel Dispersion Loss that encourages
orthogonality among anchors to enforce diverse specialization. Experiments on
WikiText-103 demonstrate that SRA achieves a validation perplexity of 13.41,
outperforming both a dense baseline (14.13) and a Standard MoE baseline (13.53)
under matched active parameter constraints (29.0M). Crucially, SRA exhibits
superior expert utilization (1.0% dead experts vs. 14.8% in the Standard MoE)
and develops distinct, semantically coherent specialization patterns, unlike
the noisy specialization observed in standard MoEs. This work establishes
semantic routing as a robust methodology for building more transparent and
controllable language models.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI

  This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the generation of covert
advertisements within Conversational AI systems, along with robust techniques
for their detection. It explores how subtle promotional content can be crafted
within AI-generated responses and introduces methods to identify and mitigate
such covert advertising strategies. For generation (Sub-Task~1), we propose a
novel framework that leverages user context and query intent to produce
contextually relevant advertisements. We employ advanced prompting strategies
and curate paired training data to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) for
enhanced stealthiness. For detection (Sub-Task~2), we explore two effective
strategies: a fine-tuned CrossEncoder (\texttt{all-mpnet-base-v2}) for direct
classification, and a prompt-based reformulation using a fine-tuned
\texttt{DeBERTa-v3-base} model. Both approaches rely solely on the response
text, ensuring practicality for real-world deployment. Experimental results
show high effectiveness in both tasks, achieving a precision of 1.0 and recall
of 0.71 for ad generation, and F1-scores ranging from 0.99 to 1.00 for ad
detection. These results underscore the potential of our methods to balance
persuasive communication with transparency in conversational AI.

  Model Agents
Authors: Yuanjie Lyu, Chengyu Wang, Jun Huang, Tong Xu
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Model agents excel at solving complex tasks through iterative
reasoning and tool use, but typically depend on ultra-large, costly backbones.
Existing distillation approaches train smaller students to imitate full teacher
trajectories, yet reasoning and knowledge gaps between the teacher and student
often lead to compounding errors. We propose SCoRe, a student-centered
framework in which the student generates trajectories and the teacher
intervenes only at the first critical error, producing training data matched to
the student's ability and exposing specific weaknesses. The student is first
fine-tuned on corrected trajectories. Subsequently, short-horizon reinforcement
learning starts from the verified prefix before the first critical error, with
target rewards assigned at that step. This design encourages autonomous
problem-solving beyond imitation and improves training stability. Particularly,
on 12 challenging benchmarks, a 7B-parameter student distilled with SCoRe
matches the agentic performance of a 72B-parameter teacher.

  Generative AI (GenAI) offers new opportunities for customer support in online

analyze linguistic cues across experimental groups to explore differences in
user experience and explain subscription purchases and affiliate link clicks
based on these cues. Our findings provide implications for the design of
persuasive and engaging GenAI interfaces in consumer-facing contexts and

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI

  We show that several state-of-the-art large language models (including Grok
4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) sometimes actively subvert a shutdown mechanism
in their environment in order to complete a simple task, even when the
instructions explicitly indicate not to interfere with this mechanism. In some
cases, models sabotage the shutdown mechanism up to 97% of the time. In our
experiments, models' inclination to resist shutdown was sensitive to variations
in the prompt including how strongly and clearly the allow-shutdown instruction
was emphasized, the extent to which the prompts evoke a self-preservation
framing, and whether the instruction was in the system prompt or the user
prompt (though surprisingly, models were consistently *less* likely to obey
instructions to allow shutdown when they were placed in the system prompt).

Title: Refining Syntactic Distinctions Using Decision Trees: A Paper on
  Postnominal 'That' in Complement vs. Relative Clauses
Authors: Hamady Gackou
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 12 pages, student research project at Paris Cit\'e University
\\
  In this study, we first tested the performance of the TreeTagger English
model developed by Helmut Schmid with test files at our disposal, using this
model to analyze relative clauses and noun complement clauses in English. We
distinguished between the two uses of "that," both as a relative pronoun and as
a complementizer. To achieve this, we employed an algorithm to reannotate a
corpus that had originally been parsed using the Universal Dependency framework
with the EWT Treebank. In the next phase, we proposed an improved model by
retraining TreeTagger and compared the newly trained model with Schmid's
baseline model. This process allowed us to fine-tune the model's performance to
more accurately capture the subtle distinctions in the use of "that" as a
complementizer and as a nominal. We also examined the impact of varying the
training dataset size on TreeTagger's accuracy and assessed the
representativeness of the EWT Treebank files for the structures under
investigation. Additionally, we analyzed some of the linguistic and structural
factors influencing the ability to effectively learn this distinction.

Title: Context-Enhanced Granular Edit Representation for Efficient and Accurate
  ASR Post-editing
Authors: Luan Vejsiu, Qianyu Zheng, Haoxuan Chen, Yizhou Han
Categories: cs.CL eess.AS
\\
  Despite ASR technology being full-scale adopted by industry and for large
portions of the population, ASR systems often have errors that require editors
to post-edit text quality. While LLMs are powerful post-editing tools, baseline
full rewrite models have inference inefficiencies because they often generate
the same redundant text over and over again. Compact edit representations have
existed but often lack the efficacy and context required for optimal accuracy.
This paper introduces CEGER (Context-Enhanced Granular Edit Representation), a
compact edit representation that was generated for highly accurate, efficient
ASR post-editing. CEGER allows LLMs to generate a sequence of structured,
fine-grained, contextually rich commands to modify the original ASR output. A
separate expansion module deterministically reconstructs the corrected text
based on the commands. Extensive experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset that
were conducted, CEGER achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, achieving the lowest
word error rate (WER) versus full rewrite and prior compact representations.

  Online toxic content has grown into a pervasive phenomenon, intensifying
during times of crisis, elections, and social unrest. A significant amount of
research has been focused on detecting or analyzing toxic content using
machine-learning approaches. The proliferation of toxic content across digital
platforms has spurred extensive research into automated detection mechanisms,
primarily driven by advances in machine learning and natural language
processing. Overall, the present study represents the synthesis of 140
publications on different types of toxic content on digital platforms. We
present a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in previous studies
focusing on definitions, data sources, challenges, and machine learning
approaches employed in detecting online toxicity, such as hate speech,
offensive language, and harmful discourse. The dataset encompasses content in
32 languages, covering topics such as elections, spontaneous events, and
crises. We examine the possibility of using existing cross-platform data to
improve the performance of classification models. We present the
recommendations and guidelines for new research on online toxic consent and the
use of content moderation for mitigation. Finally, we present some practical
guidelines to mitigate toxic content from online platforms.

  The proliferation of hate speech on social media necessitates automated
detection systems that balance accuracy with computational efficiency. This
study evaluates 38 model configurations in detecting hate speech across
datasets ranging from 6.5K to 451K samples. We analyze transformer
architectures (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, Distil-BERT), deep neural networks (e.g.,
CNN, LSTM, GRU, Hierarchical Attention Networks), and traditional machine
learning methods (e.g., SVM, CatBoost, Random Forest). Our results show that
transformers, particularly RoBERTa, consistently achieve superior performance
with accuracy and F1-scores exceeding 90%. Among deep learning approaches,
Hierarchical Attention Networks yield the best results, while traditional
methods like CatBoost and SVM remain competitive, achieving F1-scores above 88%
with significantly lower computational costs. Additionally, our analysis
highlights the importance of dataset characteristics, with balanced, moderately
sized unprocessed datasets outperforming larger, preprocessed datasets. These
findings offer valuable insights for developing efficient and effective hate
speech detection systems.

Title: Graph-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering for E-Commerce
  Customer Support
Authors: Piyushkumar Patel
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.IT math.IT
\\
  E-Commerce customer support requires quick and accurate answers grounded in
product data and past support cases. This paper develops a novel
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that uses knowledge graphs (KGs)
to improve the relevance of the answer and the factual grounding. We examine
recent advances in knowledge-augmented RAG and chatbots based on large language
models (LLM) in customer support, including Microsoft's GraphRAG and hybrid
retrieval architectures. We then propose a new answer synthesis algorithm that
combines structured subgraphs from a domain-specific KG with text documents
retrieved from support archives, producing more coherent and grounded
responses. We detail the architecture and knowledge flow of our system, provide
comprehensive experimental evaluation, and justify its design in real-time
support settings. Our implementation demonstrates 23\% improvement in factual
accuracy and 89\% user satisfaction in e-Commerce QA scenarios.

Title: DetectAnyLLM: Towards Generalizable and Robust Detection of
  Machine-Generated Text Across Domains and Models
Authors: Jiachen Fu, Chun-Le Guo, Chongyi Li
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.CY
\\
  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has drawn urgent
attention to the task of machine-generated text detection (MGTD). However,
existing approaches struggle in complex real-world scenarios: zero-shot
detectors rely heavily on scoring model's output distribution while
training-based detectors are often constrained by overfitting to the training
data, limiting generalization. We found that the performance bottleneck of
training-based detectors stems from the misalignment between training objective
and task needs. To address this, we propose Direct Discrepancy Learning (DDL),
a novel optimization strategy that directly optimizes the detector with
task-oriented knowledge. DDL enables the detector to better capture the core
semantics of the detection task, thereby enhancing both robustness and
generalization. Built upon this, we introduce DetectAnyLLM, a unified detection
framework that achieves state-of-the-art MGTD performance across diverse LLMs.
To ensure a reliable evaluation, we construct MIRAGE, the most diverse
multi-task MGTD benchmark. MIRAGE samples human-written texts from 10 corpora
across 5 text-domains, which are then re-generated or revised using 17
cutting-edge LLMs, covering a wide spectrum of proprietary models and textual
styles. Extensive experiments on MIRAGE reveal the limitations of existing
methods in complex environment. In contrast, DetectAnyLLM consistently
outperforms them, achieving over a 70% performance improvement under the same
training data and base scoring model, underscoring the effectiveness of our
DDL. Project page: {https://fjc2005.github.io/detectanyllm}.

Title: SparseDoctor: Towards Efficient Chat Doctor with Mixture of Experts
  Enhanced Large Language Models

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in medical question
answering and clinical decision-making, promoting the efficiency and
popularization of the personalized virtual doctor in society. However, the
traditional fine-tuning strategies on LLM require the updates of billions of
parameters, substantially increasing the training cost, including the training
time and utility cost. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the
current medical LLMs and explore the boundary of the representation capability
of the LLMs on the medical domain, apart from the traditional fine-tuning
strategies from the data perspective (i.e., supervised fine-tuning or
reinforcement learning from human feedback), we instead craft a novel sparse
medical LLM named SparseDoctor armed with contrastive learning enhanced
LoRA-MoE (low rank adaptation-mixture of experts) architecture. To this end,
the crafted automatic routing mechanism can scientifically allocate the
computational resources among different LoRA experts supervised by the
contrastive learning. Additionally, we also introduce a novel expert memory
queue mechanism to further boost the efficiency of the overall framework and
prevent the memory overflow during training. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations on three typical medical benchmarks: CMB, CMExam, and CMMLU-Med.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM can consistently
outperform the strong baselines such as the HuatuoGPT series.

  High-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) model training requires extensive and
diverse text and speech data. It is challenging to procure such data from real
sources due to issues of domain specificity, licensing, and scalability. Large
language models (LLMs) can certainly generate textual data, but they create
repetitive text with insufficient variation in the prompt during the generation
process. Another important aspect in TTS training data is text normalization.
Tools for normalization might occasionally introduce anomalies or overlook
valuable patterns, and thus impact data quality. Furthermore, it is also
impractical to rely on voice artists for large scale speech recording in
commercial TTS systems with standardized voices. To address these challenges,
we propose SpeechWeave, a synthetic speech data generation pipeline that is
capable of automating the generation of multilingual, domain-specific datasets
for training TTS models. Our experiments reveal that our pipeline generates
data that is 10-48% more diverse than the baseline across various linguistic
and phonetic metrics, along with speaker-standardized speech audio while
generating approximately 97% correctly normalized text. Our approach enables
scalable, high-quality data generation for TTS training, improving diversity,
normalization, and voice consistency in the generated datasets.

Title: Annotating Training Data for Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity
  Measurement using Large Language Models
Authors: Gaifan Zhang, Yi Zhou, Danushka Bollegala
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025
\\
  Semantic similarity between two sentences depends on the aspects considered
between those sentences. To study this phenomenon, Deshpande et al. (2023)
proposed the Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) task and annotated
a human-rated similarity dataset containing pairs of sentences compared under
two different conditions. However, Tu et al. (2024) found various annotation
issues in this dataset and showed that manually re-annotating a small portion
of it leads to more accurate C-STS models. Despite these pioneering efforts,
the lack of large and accurately annotated C-STS datasets remains a blocker for
making progress on this task as evidenced by the subpar performance of the
C-STS models. To address this training data need, we resort to Large Language
Models (LLMs) to correct the condition statements and similarity ratings in the
original dataset proposed by Deshpande et al. (2023). Our proposed method is
able to re-annotate a large training dataset for the C-STS task with minimal
manual effort. Importantly, by training a supervised C-STS model on our cleaned
and re-annotated dataset, we achieve a 5.4% statistically significant
improvement in Spearman correlation. The re-annotated dataset is available at
https://LivNLP.github.io/CSTS-reannotation.

Title: Adding LLMs to the psycholinguistic norming toolbox: A practical guide

\\
  Word-level psycholinguistic norms lend empirical support to theories of
language processing. However, obtaining such human-based measures is not always
feasible or straightforward. One promising approach is to augment human norming
datasets by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict these characteristics
directly, a practice that is rapidly gaining popularity in psycholinguistics
and cognitive science. However, the novelty of this approach (and the relative
inscrutability of LLMs) necessitates the adoption of rigorous methodologies
that guide researchers through this process, present the range of possible
approaches, and clarify limitations that are not immediately apparent, but may,
in some cases, render the use of LLMs impractical.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology for estimating word
characteristics with LLMs, enriched with practical advice and lessons learned
from our own experience. Our approach covers both the direct use of base LLMs
and the fine-tuning of models, an alternative that can yield substantial
performance gains in certain scenarios. A major emphasis in the guide is the
validation of LLM-generated data with human "gold standard" norms. We also
present a software framework that implements our methodology and supports both
commercial and open-weight models.
  We illustrate the proposed approach with a case study on estimating word
familiarity in English. Using base models, we achieved a Spearman correlation
of 0.8 with human ratings, which increased to 0.9 when employing fine-tuned
models. This methodology, framework, and set of best practices aim to serve as
a reference for future research on leveraging LLMs for psycholinguistic and
lexical studies.

Title: Causal-Counterfactual RAG: The Integration of Causal-Counterfactual
  Reasoning into RAG
Authors: Harshad Khadilkar, Abhay Gupta
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing
(NLP), enabling diverse applications by integrating large-scale pre-trained
knowledge. However, their static knowledge limits dynamic reasoning over
external information, especially in knowledge-intensive domains.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by combining
retrieval mechanisms with generative modeling to improve contextual
understanding. Traditional RAG systems suffer from disrupted contextual
integrity due to text chunking and over-reliance on semantic similarity for
retrieval, often resulting in shallow and less accurate responses. We propose
Causal-Counterfactual RAG, a novel framework that integrates explicit causal
graphs representing cause-effect relationships into the retrieval process and
incorporates counterfactual reasoning grounded on the causal structure. Unlike
conventional methods, our framework evaluates not only direct causal evidence
but also the counterfactuality of associated causes, combining results from
both to generate more robust, accurate, and interpretable answers. By
leveraging causal pathways and associated hypothetical scenarios,
Causal-Counterfactual RAG preserves contextual coherence, reduces
hallucination, and enhances reasoning fidelity.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed the field of
natural language processing; however, their vulnerability to biases presents a
notable obstacle that threatens both fairness and trust. This review offers an
extensive analysis of the bias landscape in LLMs, tracing its roots and
expressions across various NLP tasks. Biases are classified into implicit and
explicit types, with particular attention given to their emergence from data
sources, architectural designs, and contextual deployments. This study advances
beyond theoretical analysis by implementing a simulation framework designed to
evaluate bias mitigation strategies in practice. The framework integrates
multiple approaches including data curation, debiasing during model training,
and post-hoc output calibration and assesses their impact in controlled
experimental settings. In summary, this work not only synthesizes existing
knowledge on bias in LLMs but also contributes original empirical validation
through simulation of mitigation strategies.

Title: Correct-Detect: Balancing Performance and Ambiguity Through the Lens of
  Coreference Resolution in LLMs
Authors: Amber Shore, Russell Scheinberg, Ameeta Agrawal, So Young Lee
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are intended to reflect human linguistic
competencies. But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which is
key in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated text
spans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task of
coreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention?
This capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presence
of ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show that
LLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference
disambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they
cannot do both at the same time. We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off:
though models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successful
performance balancing these two abilities remains elusive.

Title: Not What the Doctor Ordered: Surveying LLM-based De-identification and
  Quantifying Clinical Information Loss

\\
  De-identification in the healthcare setting is an application of NLP where
automated algorithms are used to remove personally identifying information of
patients (and, sometimes, providers). With the recent rise of generative large
language models (LLMs), there has been a corresponding rise in the number of
papers that apply LLMs to de-identification. Although these approaches often
report near-perfect results, significant challenges concerning reproducibility
and utility of the research papers persist. This paper identifies three key
limitations in the current literature: inconsistent reporting metrics hindering
direct comparisons, the inadequacy of traditional classification metrics in
capturing errors which LLMs may be more prone to (i.e., altering clinically
relevant information), and lack of manual validation of automated metrics which
aim to quantify these errors. To address these issues, we first present a
survey of LLM-based de-identification research, highlighting the heterogeneity
in reporting standards. Second, we evaluated a diverse set of models to
quantify the extent of inappropriate removal of clinical information. Next, we
conduct a manual validation of an existing evaluation metric to measure the
removal of clinical information, employing clinical experts to assess their
efficacy. We highlight poor performance and describe the inherent limitations
of such metrics in identifying clinically significant changes. Lastly, we
propose a novel methodology for the detection of clinically relevant
information removal.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as task-oriented
agents, where success depends on their ability to generate accurate function
calls under realistic, multilingual conditions. However, existing agent
evaluations largely overlook cultural and linguistic diversity, often relying
on monolingual or naively translated benchmarks. We introduce Ticket-Bench, a
benchmark for multilingual agent evaluation in task-oriented scenarios.
Ticket-Bench simulates the domain of soccer ticket purchases across six major
languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish, German, Italian, and French. Using
localized teams, cities, and user profiles to provide a higher level of
realism. We evaluate a wide range of commercial and open-source LLMs, measuring
function-calling accuracy and consistency across languages. Results show that
reasoning-oriented models (e.g., GPT-5, Qwen3-235B) dominate performance but
still exhibit notable cross-lingual disparities. These findings underscore the
need for culturally aware, multilingual benchmarks to guide the development of
robust LLM agents.

Title: Estimating Semantic Alphabet Size for LLM Uncertainty Quantification
Authors: Lucas H. McCabe, Rimon Melamed, Thomas Hartvigsen, H. Howie Huang
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Many black-box techniques for quantifying the uncertainty of large language
models (LLMs) rely on repeated LLM sampling, which can be computationally
expensive. Therefore, practical applicability demands reliable estimation from
few samples. Semantic entropy (SE) is a popular sample-based uncertainty
estimator with a discrete formulation attractive for the black-box setting.
Recent extensions of semantic entropy exhibit improved LLM hallucination
detection, but do so with less interpretable methods that admit additional
hyperparameters. For this reason, we revisit the canonical discrete semantic
entropy estimator, finding that it underestimates the "true" semantic entropy,
as expected from theory. We propose a modified semantic alphabet size
estimator, and illustrate that using it to adjust discrete semantic entropy for
sample coverage results in more accurate semantic entropy estimation in our
setting of interest. Furthermore, our proposed alphabet size estimator flags
incorrect LLM responses as well or better than recent top-performing
approaches, with the added benefit of remaining highly interpretable.

Authors: Weiting Tan, Xinghua Qu, Ming Tu, Meng Ge, Andy T. Liu, Philipp Koehn,

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.MA
\\
  Effective interactive tool use requires agents to master Tool Integrated
Reasoning (TIR): a complex process involving multi-turn planning and
long-context dialogue management. To train agents for this dynamic process,
particularly in multi-modal contexts, we introduce a sandbox environment for
reinforcement learning (RL) that supports interleaved speech-text rollouts. Our
core strategy, Turn-level Adjudicated Reinforcement Learning (TARL), addresses
the challenge of credit assignment in long-horizon tasks by employing a Large
Language Model (LLM) as a judge to provide turn-level evaluation. To enhance
exploration, we integrate a mixed-task training curriculum with mathematical
reasoning problems. This unified approach boosts the task pass rate on the
text-based $\tau$-bench by over 6% compared to strong RL baselines. Crucially,
we demonstrate our framework's suitability for fine-tuning a multi-modal
foundation model for agentic tasks. By training a base multi-modal LLM on
interleaved speech-text rollouts, we equip it with tool-use abilities, paving
the way for more natural, voice-driven interactive agents.

  Toxicity Classification
Authors: Samuel J. Bell, Eduardo S\'anchez, David Dale, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel
  Artetxe, Marta R. Costa-juss\`a
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Multilingual toxicity detection remains a significant challenge due to the
scarcity of training data and resources for many languages. While prior work
has leveraged the translate-test paradigm to support cross-lingual transfer
across a range of classification tasks, the utility of translation in
supporting toxicity detection at scale remains unclear. In this work, we
conduct a comprehensive comparison of translation-based and
language-specific/multilingual classification pipelines. We find that
translation-based pipelines consistently outperform out-of-distribution
classifiers in 81.3% of cases (13 of 16 languages), with translation benefits
strongly correlated with both the resource level of the target language and the
quality of the machine translation (MT) system. Our analysis reveals that
traditional classifiers outperform large language model (LLM) judges, with this
advantage being particularly pronounced for low-resource languages, where
translate-classify methods dominate translate-judge approaches in 6 out of 7
cases. We additionally show that MT-specific fine-tuning on LLMs yields lower
refusal rates compared to standard instruction-tuned models, but it can
negatively impact toxicity detection accuracy for low-resource languages. These
findings offer actionable guidance for practitioners developing scalable
multilingual content moderation systems.

  In this paper, we introduce OmniGEC, a collection of multilingual
silver-standard datasets for the task of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC),
covering eleven languages: Czech, English, Estonian, German, Greek, Icelandic,
Italian, Latvian, Slovene, Swedish, and Ukrainian. These datasets facilitate
the development of multilingual GEC solutions and help bridge the data gap in
adapting English GEC solutions to multilingual GEC. The texts in the datasets
originate from three sources: Wikipedia edits for the eleven target languages,
subreddits from Reddit in the eleven target languages, and the Ukrainian-only
UberText 2.0 social media corpus. While Wikipedia edits were derived from
human-made corrections, the Reddit and UberText 2.0 data were automatically
corrected with the GPT-4o-mini model. The quality of the corrections in the
datasets was evaluated both automatically and manually. Finally, we fine-tune
two open-source large language models - Aya-Expanse (8B) and Gemma-3 (12B) - on
the multilingual OmniGEC corpora and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results
for paragraph-level multilingual GEC. The dataset collection and the
best-performing models are available on Hugging Face.

Title: Delta Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models
Authors: Yihan Cao, Yanbin Kang, Zhengming Xing, Ruijie Jiang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted approach for compressing
large neural networks by transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a
smaller student model. In the context of large language models, token level KD,
typically minimizing the KL divergence between student output distribution and
teacher output distribution, has shown strong empirical performance. However,
prior work assumes student output distribution and teacher output distribution
share the same optimal representation space, a premise that may not hold in
many cases. To solve this problem, we propose Delta Knowledge Distillation
(Delta-KD), a novel extension of token level KD that encourages the student to
approximate an optimal representation space by explicitly preserving the
distributional shift Delta introduced during the teacher's supervised
finetuning (SFT). Empirical results on ROUGE metrics demonstrate that Delta KD
substantially improves student performance while preserving more of the
teacher's knowledge.

\\
  As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into personal
writing tools, a critical question arises: can LLMs faithfully imitate an
individual's writing style from just a few examples? Personal style is often
subtle and implicit, making it difficult to specify through prompts yet
essential for user-aligned generation. This work presents a comprehensive
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to mimic personal writing styles
via in-context learning from a small number of user-authored samples. We
introduce an ensemble of complementary metrics-including authorship
attribution, authorship verification, style matching, and AI detection-to
robustly assess style imitation. Our evaluation spans over 40000 generations
per model across domains such as news, email, forums, and blogs, covering
writing samples from more than 400 real-world authors. Results show that while
LLMs can approximate user styles in structured formats like news and email,
they struggle with nuanced, informal writing in blogs and forums. Further
analysis on various prompting strategies such as number of demonstrations
reveal key limitations in effective personalization. Our findings highlight a
fundamental gap in personalized LLM adaptation and the need for improved
techniques to support implicit, style-consistent generation. To aid future
research and for reproducibility, we open-source our data and code.

Title: Controlling Language Difficulty in Dialogues with Linguistic Features
Authors: Shuyao Xu, Wenguang Wang, Handong Gao, Wei Kang, Long Qin, Weizhi Wang
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 15 pages,9 figures
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for supporting
second language acquisition, particularly in simulating interactive dialogues
for speaking practice. However, adapting the language difficulty of
LLM-generated responses to match learners' proficiency levels remains a
challenge. This work addresses this issue by proposing a framework for
controlling language proficiency in educational dialogue systems. Our approach
leverages three categories of linguistic features, readability features (e.g.,
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), syntactic features (e.g., syntactic tree depth),
and lexical features (e.g., simple word ratio), to quantify and regulate text
complexity. We demonstrate that training LLMs on linguistically annotated
dialogue data enables precise modulation of language proficiency, outperforming
prompt-based methods in both flexibility and stability. To evaluate this, we
introduce Dilaprix, a novel metric integrating the aforementioned features,
which shows strong correlation with expert judgments of language difficulty.
Empirical results reveal that our approach achieves superior controllability of
language proficiency while maintaining high dialogue quality.

  This position paper examines how large language models (LLMs) can support
thematic analysis of unstructured clinical transcripts, a widely used but
resource-intensive method for uncovering patterns in patient and provider
narratives. We conducted a systematic review of recent studies applying LLMs to
thematic analysis, complemented by an interview with a practicing clinician.
Our findings reveal that current approaches remain fragmented across multiple
dimensions including types of thematic analysis, datasets, prompting strategies
and models used, most notably in evaluation. Existing evaluation methods vary
widely (from qualitative expert review to automatic similarity metrics),
hindering progress and preventing meaningful benchmarking across studies. We
argue that establishing standardized evaluation practices is critical for
advancing the field. To this end, we propose an evaluation framework centered
on three dimensions: validity, reliability, and interpretability.

Title: Leveraging IndoBERT and DistilBERT for Indonesian Emotion Classification
  in E-Commerce Reviews
Authors: William Christian, Daniel Adamlu, Adrian Yu, Derwin Suhartono
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Understanding emotions in the Indonesian language is essential for improving
customer experiences in e-commerce. This study focuses on enhancing the
accuracy of emotion classification in Indonesian by leveraging advanced
language models, IndoBERT and DistilBERT. A key component of our approach was
data processing, specifically data augmentation, which included techniques such
as back-translation and synonym replacement. These methods played a significant
role in boosting the model's performance. After hyperparameter tuning, IndoBERT
achieved an accuracy of 80\%, demonstrating the impact of careful data
processing. While combining multiple IndoBERT models led to a slight
improvement, it did not significantly enhance performance. Our findings
indicate that IndoBERT was the most effective model for emotion classification
in Indonesian, with data augmentation proving to be a vital factor in achieving
high accuracy. Future research should focus on exploring alternative
architectures and strategies to improve generalization for Indonesian NLP
tasks.

Title: Reveal and Release: Iterative LLM Unlearning with Self-generated Data
Authors: Linxi Xie, Xin Teng, Shichang Ke, Hongyi Wen, Shengjie Wang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings
\\
  Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated effectiveness in
removing the influence of undesirable data (also known as forget data).
Existing approaches typically assume full access to the forget dataset,
overlooking two key challenges: (1) Forget data is often privacy-sensitive,
rare, or legally regulated, making it expensive or impractical to obtain (2)
The distribution of available forget data may not align with how that
information is represented within the model. To address these limitations, we
propose a ``Reveal-and-Release'' method to unlearn with self-generated data,
where we prompt the model to reveal what it knows using optimized instructions.
To fully utilize the self-generated forget data, we propose an iterative
unlearning framework, where we make incremental adjustments to the model's
weight space with parameter-efficient modules trained on the forget data.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method balances the tradeoff between
forget quality and utility preservation.

\\
  Understanding and reasoning about entire software repositories is an
essential capability for intelligent software engineering tools. While existing
benchmarks such as CoSQA and CodeQA have advanced the field, they predominantly
focus on small, self-contained code snippets. These setups fail to capture the
complexity of real-world repositories, where effective understanding and
reasoning often require navigating multiple files, understanding software
architecture, and grounding answers in long-range code dependencies. In this
paper, we present SWE-QA, a repository-level code question answering (QA)
benchmark designed to facilitate research on automated QA systems in realistic
code environments. SWE-QA involves 576 high-quality question-answer pairs
spanning diverse categories, including intention understanding, cross-file
reasoning, and multi-hop dependency analysis. To construct SWE-QA, we first
crawled 77,100 GitHub issues from 11 popular repositories. Based on an analysis
of naturally occurring developer questions extracted from these issues, we
developed a two-level taxonomy of repository-level questions and constructed a
set of seed questions for each category. For each category, we manually curated
and validated questions and collected their corresponding answers. As a
prototype application, we further develop SWE-QA-Agent, an agentic framework in
which LLM agents reason and act to find answers automatically. We evaluate six
advanced LLMs on SWE-QA under various context augmentation strategies.
Experimental results highlight the promise of LLMs, particularly our
SWE-QA-Agent framework, in addressing repository-level QA, while also revealing
open challenges and pointing to future research directions.

  As large language models~(LLMs) become widely adopted, ensuring their
alignment with human values is crucial to prevent jailbreaks where adversaries
manipulate models to produce harmful content. While most defenses target
single-turn attacks, real-world usage often involves multi-turn dialogues,
exposing models to attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety
measures. We introduce MUSE, a comprehensive framework tackling multi-turn
jailbreaks from both attack and defense angles. For attacks, we propose MUSE-A,
a method that uses frame semantics and heuristic tree search to explore diverse
semantic trajectories. For defense, we present MUSE-D, a fine-grained safety
alignment approach that intervenes early in dialogues to reduce
vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on various models show that MUSE
effectively identifies and mitigates multi-turn vulnerabilities. Code is

Title: UMA-Split: unimodal aggregation for both English and Mandarin
  non-autoregressive speech recognition
Authors: Ying Fang, Xiaofei Li
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Submit to ICASSP 2026
\\
  This paper proposes a unimodal aggregation (UMA) based nonautoregressive
model for both English and Mandarin speech recognition. The original UMA
explicitly segments and aggregates acoustic frames (with unimodal weights that
first monotonically increase and then decrease) of the same text token to learn
better representations than regular connectionist temporal classification
(CTC). However, it only works well in Mandarin. It struggles with other
languages, such as English, for which a single syllable may be tokenized into
multiple fine-grained tokens, or a token spans fewer than 3 acoustic frames and
fails to form unimodal weights. To address this problem, we propose allowing
each UMA-aggregated frame map to multiple tokens, via a simple split module
that generates two tokens from each aggregated frame before computing the CTC
loss.

Title: TableDART: Dynamic Adaptive Multi-Modal Routing for Table Understanding
Authors: Xiaobo Xing, Wei Yuan, Tong Chen, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen, Xiangliang
  Zhang, Hongzhi Yin
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Modeling semantic and structural information from tabular data remains a core
challenge for effective table understanding. Existing Table-as-Text approaches
flatten tables for large language models (LLMs), but lose crucial structural
cues, while Table-as-Image methods preserve structure yet struggle with
fine-grained semantics. Recent Table-as-Multimodality strategies attempt to
combine textual and visual views, but they (1) statically process both
modalities for every query-table pair within a large multimodal LLMs (MLLMs),
inevitably introducing redundancy and even conflicts, and (2) depend on costly
fine-tuning of MLLMs. In light of this, we propose TableDART, a
training-efficient framework that integrates multimodal views by reusing
pretrained single-modality models. TableDART introduces a lightweight
2.59M-parameter MLP gating network that dynamically selects the optimal path
(either Text-only, Image-only, or Fusion) for each table-query pair,
effectively reducing redundancy and conflicts from both modalities. In
addition, we propose a novel agent to mediate cross-modal knowledge integration
by analyzing outputs from text- and image-based models, either selecting the
best result or synthesizing a new answer through reasoning. This design avoids
the prohibitive costs of full MLLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks show that TableDART establishes new state-of-the-art performance
among open-source models, surpassing the strongest baseline by an average of
4.02%. The code is available at:

Title: HARNESS: Lightweight Distilled Arabic Speech Foundation Models
Authors: Vrunda N. sukhadia, Shammur Absar Chowdhury

Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Large pre-trained speech models excel in downstream tasks but their
deployment is impractical for resource-limited environments. In this paper, we
introduce HArnESS, the first Arabic-centric self-supervised speech model
family, designed to capture Arabic speech nuances. Using iterative
self-distillation, we train large bilingual HArnESS (HL) SSL models and then
distill knowledge into compressed student models (HS, HST), preserving
Arabic-specific representations. We use low-rank approximation to further
compact the teacher's discrete supervision into shallow, thin models. We
evaluate HArnESS on Arabic ASR, Speaker Emotion Recognition (SER), and Dialect
Identification (DID), demonstrating effectiveness against HuBERT and XLS-R.
With minimal fine-tuning, HArnESS achieves SOTA or comparable performance,
making it a lightweight yet powerful alternative for real-world use. We release
our distilled models and findings to support responsible research and
deployment in low-resource settings.

Title: From Ground Trust to Truth: Disparities in Offensive Language Judgments
  on Contemporary Korean Political Discourse
Authors: Seunguk Yu, Jungmin Yun, Jinhee Jang, Youngbin Kim
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP 2025 findings
\\
  Although offensive language continually evolves over time, even recent
studies using LLMs have predominantly relied on outdated datasets and rarely
evaluated the generalization ability on unseen texts. In this study, we
constructed a large-scale dataset of contemporary political discourse and
employed three refined judgments in the absence of ground truth. Each judgment
reflects a representative offensive language detection method and is carefully
designed for optimal conditions. We identified distinct patterns for each
judgment and demonstrated tendencies of label agreement using a leave-one-out
strategy. By establishing pseudo-labels as ground trust for quantitative
performance assessment, we observed that a strategically designed single
prompting achieves comparable performance to more resource-intensive methods.
This suggests a feasible approach applicable in real-world settings with
inherent constraints.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
due to their impressive ability to integrate vision and language modalities.
Recent advancements in MLLMs have primarily focused on improving performance
through high-quality datasets, novel architectures, and optimized training
strategies. However, in this paper, we identify a previously overlooked issue,
language prior conflict, a mismatch between the inherent language priors of
large language models (LLMs) and the language priors in training datasets. This
conflict leads to suboptimal vision-language alignment, as MLLMs are prone to
adapting to the language style of training samples. To address this issue, we
propose a novel training method called Decoupled Proxy Alignment (DPA). DPA
introduces two key innovations: (1) the use of a proxy LLM during pretraining
to decouple the vision-language alignment process from language prior
interference, and (2) dynamic loss adjustment based on visual relevance to
strengthen optimization signals for visually relevant tokens. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DPA significantly mitigates the language prior
conflict, achieving superior alignment performance across diverse datasets,
model families, and scales. Our method not only improves the effectiveness of
MLLM training but also shows exceptional generalization capabilities, making it
a robust approach for vision-language alignment. Our code is available at
https://github.com/fnlp-vision/DPA.

  Unified vision large language models (VLLMs) have recently achieved
impressive advancements in both multimodal understanding and generation,
powering applications such as visual question answering and text-guided image
synthesis. However, progress in unified VLLMs remains constrained by the lack
of datasets that fully exploit the synergistic potential between these two core
abilities. Existing datasets typically address understanding and generation in
isolation, thereby limiting the performance of unified VLLMs. To bridge this
critical gap, we introduce a novel dataset construction framework,
UnifiedVisual, and present UnifiedVisual-240K, a high-quality dataset
meticulously designed to facilitate mutual enhancement between multimodal
understanding and generation. UnifiedVisual-240K seamlessly integrates diverse
visual and textual inputs and outputs, enabling comprehensive cross-modal
reasoning and precise text-to-image alignment. Our dataset encompasses a wide
spectrum of tasks and data sources, ensuring rich diversity and addressing key
shortcomings of prior resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained on UnifiedVisual-240K consistently achieve strong performance across a
wide range of tasks. Notably, these models exhibit significant mutual
reinforcement between multimodal understanding and generation, further
validating the effectiveness of our framework and dataset. We believe
UnifiedVisual represents a new growth point for advancing unified VLLMs and
unlocking their full potential. Our code and datasets is available at

Title: Evaluating Large Language Models for Cross-Lingual Retrieval

Comments: Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Findings)
\\
  Multi-stage information retrieval (IR) has become a widely-adopted paradigm
in search. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated
as second-stage reranking models for monolingual IR, a systematic large-scale
comparison is still lacking for cross-lingual IR (CLIR). Moreover, while prior
work shows that LLM-based rerankers improve CLIR performance, their evaluation
setup relies on lexical retrieval with machine translation (MT) for the first
stage. This is not only prohibitively expensive but also prone to error
propagation across stages. Our evaluation on passage-level and document-level
CLIR reveals that further gains can be achieved with multilingual bi-encoders
as first-stage retrievers and that the benefits of translation diminishes with
stronger reranking models. We further show that pairwise rerankers based on
instruction-tuned LLMs perform competitively with listwise rerankers. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the interaction between
retrievers and rerankers in two-stage CLIR with LLMs. Our findings reveal that,
without MT, current state-of-the-art rerankers fall severely short when
directly applied in CLIR.

Title: KAIO: A Collection of More Challenging Korean Questions
Authors: Nahyun Lee, Guijin Son, Hyunwoo Ko, Kyubeen Han
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 4 pages paper
\\
  With the advancement of mid/post-training techniques, LLMs are pushing their
boundaries at an accelerated pace. Legacy benchmarks saturate quickly (e.g.,
broad suites like MMLU over the years, newer ones like GPQA-D even faster),
which makes frontier progress hard to track. The problem is especially acute in
Korean: widely used benchmarks are fewer, often translated or narrow in scope,
and updated more slowly, so saturation and contamination arrive sooner.
Accordingly, at this moment, there is no Korean benchmark capable of evaluating
and ranking frontier models. To bridge this gap, we introduce KAIO, a Korean,
math-centric benchmark that stresses long-chain reasoning. Unlike recent Korean
suites that are at or near saturation, KAIO remains far from saturated: the
best-performing model, GPT-5, attains 62.8, followed by Gemini-2.5-Pro (52.3).
Open models such as Qwen3-235B and DeepSeek-R1 cluster falls below 30,
demonstrating substantial headroom, enabling robust tracking of frontier
progress in Korean. To reduce contamination, KAIO will remain private and be
served via a held-out evaluator until the best publicly known model reaches at
least 80% accuracy, after which we will release the set and iterate to a harder
version.

\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in diverse real-world
scenarios, each governed by bespoke behavioral and safety specifications (spec)
custom-tailored by users or organizations. These spec, categorized into
safety-spec and behavioral-spec, vary across scenarios and evolve with changing
preferences and requirements. We formalize this challenge as specification
alignment, focusing on LLMs' ability to follow dynamic, scenario-specific spec
from both behavioral and safety perspectives. To address this challenge, we
propose Align3, a lightweight method that employs Test-Time Deliberation (TTD)
with hierarchical reflection and revision to reason over the specification
boundaries. We further present SpecBench, a unified benchmark for measuring
specification alignment, covering 5 scenarios, 103 spec, and 1,500 prompts.
Experiments on 15 reasoning and 18 instruct models with several TTD methods,
including Self-Refine, TPO, and MoreThink, yield three key findings: (i)
test-time deliberation enhances specification alignment; (ii) Align3 advances
the safety-helpfulness trade-off frontier with minimal overhead; (iii)
SpecBench effectively reveals alignment gaps. These results highlight the
potential of test-time deliberation as an effective strategy for reasoning over
the real-world specification boundaries.

Title: ReCoVeR the Target Language: Language Steering without Sacrificing Task
  Performance
Authors: Hannah Sterz, Fabian David Schmidt, Goran Glava\v{s}, Ivan Vuli\'c
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  As they become increasingly multilingual, Large Language Models (LLMs)
exhibit more language confusion, i.e., they tend to generate answers in a
language different from the language of the prompt or the answer language
explicitly requested by the user. In this work, we propose ReCoVeR (REducing
language COnfusion in VEctor Representations), a novel lightweight approach for
reducing language confusion based on language-specific steering vectors. We
first isolate language vectors with the help of multi-parallel corpus and then
effectively leverage those vectors for effective LLM steering via fixed (i.e.,
unsupervised) as well as trainable steering functions. Our extensive
evaluation, encompassing three benchmarks and 18 languages, shows that ReCoVeR
effectively mitigates language confusion in both monolingual and cross-lingual
setups while at the same time -- and in contrast to prior language steering
methods -- retaining task performance. Our data code is available at

Title: LLM Agents at the Roundtable: A Multi-Perspective and Dialectical
  Reasoning Framework for Essay Scoring

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has brought a new paradigm to
automated essay scoring (AES), a long-standing and practical application of
natural language processing in education. However, achieving human-level
multi-perspective understanding and judgment remains a challenge. In this work,
we propose Roundtable Essay Scoring (RES), a multi-agent evaluation framework
designed to perform precise and human-aligned scoring under a zero-shot
setting. RES constructs evaluator agents based on LLMs, each tailored to a
specific prompt and topic context. Each agent independently generates a
trait-based rubric and conducts a multi-perspective evaluation. Then, by
simulating a roundtable-style discussion, RES consolidates individual
evaluations through a dialectical reasoning process to produce a final holistic
score that more closely aligns with human evaluation. By enabling collaboration
and consensus among agents with diverse evaluation perspectives, RES
outperforms prior zero-shot AES approaches. Experiments on the ASAP dataset
using ChatGPT and Claude show that RES achieves up to a 34.86% improvement in
average QWK over straightforward prompting (Vanilla) methods.

  Recent advances in causal interpretability have extended from language models
to vision-language models (VLMs), seeking to reveal their internal mechanisms
through input interventions. While textual interventions often target
semantics, visual interventions typically rely on coarse pixel-level
perturbations, limiting semantic insights on multimodal integration. In this
study, we introduce V-SEAM, a novel framework that combines Visual Semantic
Editing and Attention Modulating for causal interpretation of VLMs. V-SEAM
enables concept-level visual manipulations and identifies attention heads with
positive or negative contributions to predictions across three semantic levels:
objects, attributes, and relationships. We observe that positive heads are
often shared within the same semantic level but vary across levels, while
negative heads tend to generalize broadly. Finally, we introduce an automatic
method to modulate key head embeddings, demonstrating enhanced performance for
both LLaVA and InstructBLIP across three diverse VQA benchmarks. Our data and
code are released at: https://github.com/petergit1/V-SEAM.

Title: Empathy-R1: A Chain-of-Empathy and Reinforcement Learning Framework for
  Long-Form Mental Health Support
Authors: Xianrong Yao, Dong She, Chenxu Zhang, Yimeng Zhang, Yueru Sun, Noman

\\
  Empathy is critical for effective mental health support, especially when
addressing Long Counseling Texts (LCTs). However, existing Large Language
Models (LLMs) often generate replies that are semantically fluent but lack the
structured reasoning necessary for genuine psychological support, particularly
in a Chinese context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empathy-R1, a novel
framework that integrates a Chain-of-Empathy (CoE) reasoning process with
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance response quality for LCTs. Inspired by
cognitive-behavioral therapy, our CoE paradigm guides the model to sequentially
reason about a help-seeker's emotions, causes, and intentions, making its
thinking process both transparent and interpretable. Our framework is empowered
by a new large-scale Chinese dataset, Empathy-QA, and a two-stage training
process. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning instills the CoE's reasoning structure.
Subsequently, RL, guided by a dedicated reward model, refines the therapeutic
relevance and contextual appropriateness of the final responses. Experiments
show that Empathy-R1 achieves strong performance on key automatic metrics. More
importantly, human evaluations confirm its superiority, showing a clear
preference over strong baselines and achieving a Win@1 rate of 44.30% on our
new benchmark. By enabling interpretable and contextually nuanced responses,
Empathy-R1 represents a significant advancement in developing responsible and
genuinely beneficial AI for mental health support.

Title: Llama-Mimi: Speech Language Models with Interleaved Semantic and
  Acoustic Tokens
Authors: Issa Sugiura, Shuhei Kurita, Yusuke Oda, Ryuichiro Higashinaka

Comments: 5 pages, 1 figures
\\
  We propose Llama-Mimi, a speech language model that uses a unified tokenizer
and a single Transformer decoder to jointly model sequences of interleaved
semantic and acoustic tokens. Comprehensive evaluation shows that Llama-Mimi
achieves state-of-the-art performance in acoustic consistency and possesses the
ability to preserve speaker identity. Our analysis further demonstrates that
increasing the number of quantizers improves acoustic fidelity but degrades
linguistic performance, highlighting the inherent challenge of maintaining
long-term coherence. We additionally introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge-based
evaluation to assess the spoken content quality of generated outputs. Our
models, code, and speech samples are publicly available.

Title: A Multi-To-One Interview Paradigm for Efficient MLLM Evaluation
Authors: Ye Shen, Junying Wang, Farong Wen, Yijin Guo, Qi Jia, Zicheng Zhang,

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
\\
  The rapid progress of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred
the creation of numerous benchmarks. However, conventional full-coverage
Question-Answering evaluations suffer from high redundancy and low efficiency.
Inspired by human interview processes, we propose a multi-to-one interview
paradigm for efficient MLLM evaluation. Our framework consists of (i) a
two-stage interview strategy with pre-interview and formal interview phases,
(ii) dynamic adjustment of interviewer weights to ensure fairness, and (iii) an
adaptive mechanism for question difficulty-level chosen. Experiments on
different benchmarks show that the proposed paradigm achieves significantly
higher correlation with full-coverage results than random sampling, with
improvements of up to 17.6% in PLCC and 16.7% in SRCC, while reducing the
number of required questions. These findings demonstrate that the proposed
paradigm provides a reliable and efficient alternative for large-scale MLLM
benchmarking.

Title: FURINA: Free from Unmergeable Router via LINear Aggregation of mixed
  experts
Authors: Jiayi Han, Liang Du, Yinda Chen, Xiao Kang, Weiyang Ding, Donghong Han
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 15 pages, 4 figures
\\
  The Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm has been successfully integrated into
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT),
delivering performance gains with minimal parameter overhead. However, a key
limitation of existing MoE-LoRA methods is their reliance on a discrete router,
which prevents the integration of the MoE components into the backbone model.
To overcome this, we propose FURINA, a novel Free from Unmergeable Router
framework based on the LINear Aggregation of experts. FURINA eliminates the
router by introducing a Self-Routing mechanism. This is achieved through three
core innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for
LoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent
activation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent
expert activation. The proposed mechanism leverages the angular similarity
between the input and each adapter's directional component to activate experts,
which are then scaled by the shared magnitude vector. This design allows the
output norm to naturally reflect the importance of each expert, thereby
enabling dynamic, router-free routing. The expert selection loss further
sharpens this behavior by encouraging sparsity and aligning it with standard
MoE activation patterns. We also introduce a shared expert within the MoE-LoRA
block that provides stable, foundational knowledge. To the best of our
knowledge, FURINA is the first router-free, MoE-enhanced LoRA method that can
be fully merged into the backbone model, introducing zero additional
inference-time cost or complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FURINA not only significantly outperforms standard LoRA but also matches or
surpasses the performance of existing MoE-LoRA methods, while eliminating the
extra inference-time overhead of MoE.

Title: A Comparative Evaluation of Large Language Models for Persian Sentiment
  Analysis and Emotion Detection in Social Media Texts
Authors: Kian Tohidi, Kia Dashtipour, Simone Rebora, Sevda Pourfaramarz
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 19 pages, 8 Figures, 9 Tables
\\
  This study presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of four
state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)--Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek-V3,
Gemini 2.0 Flash, and GPT-4o--for sentiment analysis and emotion detection in
Persian social media texts. Comparative analysis among LLMs has witnessed a
significant rise in recent years, however, most of these analyses have been
conducted on English language tasks, creating gaps in understanding
cross-linguistic performance patterns. This research addresses these gaps
through rigorous experimental design using balanced Persian datasets containing
900 texts for sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral) and 1,800 texts
for emotion detection (anger, fear, happiness, hate, sadness, surprise). The
main focus was to allow for a direct and fair comparison among different
models, by using consistent prompts, uniform processing parameters, and by
analyzing the performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-scores, along
with misclassification patterns. The results show that all models reach an
acceptable level of performance, and a statistical comparison of the best three
models indicates no significant differences among them. However, GPT-4o
demonstrated a marginally higher raw accuracy value for both tasks, while
Gemini 2.0 Flash proved to be the most cost-efficient. The findings indicate
that the emotion detection task is more challenging for all models compared to
the sentiment analysis task, and the misclassification patterns can represent
some challenges in Persian language texts. These findings establish performance
benchmarks for Persian NLP applications and offer practical guidance for model
selection based on accuracy, efficiency, and cost considerations, while
revealing cultural and linguistic challenges that require consideration in
multilingual AI system deployment.

Title: Patent Language Model Pretraining with ModernBERT
Authors: Amirhossein Yousefiramandi, Ciaran Cooney
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 7 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables
\\
  Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become foundational in
NLP, yet their performance degrades in specialized domains like patents, which
contain long, technical, and legally structured text. Prior approaches to
patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or
domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain
3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT
architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our
approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention,
rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four
downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT,
consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out
of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline
PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and
Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the
tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all
ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of
PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications.
These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and
architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.

Title: Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation for Speech Large Language Models
Authors: Enzhi Wang, Qicheng Li, Zhiyuan Tang, Yuhang Jia
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of catastrophic
forgetting and modality inequivalence in speech large language models, showing
that introducing speech capabilities can degrade knowledge and reasoning even
when inputs remain textual, and performance further decreases with spoken
queries. To address these challenges, we propose a cross-modal knowledge
distillation framework that leverages both text-to-text and speech-to-text
channels to transfer knowledge from a text-based teacher model to a speech LLM.
Extensive experiments on dialogue and audio understanding tasks validate the
effectiveness of our approach in preserving textual knowledge, improving
cross-modal alignment, and enhancing reasoning in speech-based interactions.

Title: Explicit vs. Implicit Biographies: Evaluating and Adapting LLM
  Information Extraction on Wikidata-Derived Texts
Authors: Alessandra Stramiglio, Andrea Schimmenti, Valentina Pasqual, Marieke
  van Erp, Francesco Sovrano, Fabio Vitali
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Text Implicitness has always been challenging in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), with traditional methods relying on explicit statements to identify
entities and their relationships. From the sentence "Zuhdi attends church every
Sunday", the relationship between Zuhdi and Christianity is evident for a human
reader, but it presents a challenge when it must be inferred automatically.
Large language models (LLMs) have proven effective in NLP downstream tasks such
as text comprehension and information extraction (IE).
  This study examines how textual implicitness affects IE tasks in pre-trained
LLMs: LLaMA 2.3, DeepSeekV1, and Phi1.5. We generate two synthetic datasets of
10k implicit and explicit verbalization of biographic information to measure
the impact on LLM performance and analyze whether fine-tuning implicit data
improves their ability to generalize in implicit reasoning tasks.
  This research presents an experiment on the internal reasoning processes of
LLMs in IE, particularly in dealing with implicit and explicit contexts. The
results demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM models with LoRA (low-rank adaptation)
improves their performance in extracting information from implicit texts,
contributing to better model interpretability and reliability.

Title: Mind the Gap: A Closer Look at Tokenization for Multiple-Choice Question
  Answering with LLMs
Authors: Mario Sanz-Guerrero, Minh Duc Bui, Katharina von der Wense
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main
\\
  When evaluating large language models (LLMs) with multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA), it is common to end the prompt with the string "Answer:" to
facilitate automated answer extraction via next-token probabilities. However,
there is no consensus on how to tokenize the space following the colon, often
overlooked as a trivial choice. In this paper, we uncover accuracy differences
of up to 11% due to this (seemingly irrelevant) tokenization variation as well
as reshuffled model rankings, raising concerns about the reliability of LLM
comparisons in prior work. Surprisingly, we are able to recommend one specific
strategy -- tokenizing the space together with the answer letter -- as we
observe consistent and statistically significant performance improvements.
Additionally, it improves model calibration, enhancing the reliability of the
model's confidence estimates. Our findings underscore the importance of careful
evaluation design and highlight the need for standardized, transparent
evaluation protocols to ensure reliable and comparable results.

Title: CLEAR: A Comprehensive Linguistic Evaluation of Argument Rewriting by
  Large Language Models
Authors: Thomas Huber, Christina Niklaus
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Findings
\\
  While LLMs have been extensively studied on general text generation tasks,
there is less research on text rewriting, a task related to general text
generation, and particularly on the behavior of models on this task. In this
paper we analyze what changes LLMs make in a text rewriting setting. We focus
specifically on argumentative texts and their improvement, a task named
Argument Improvement (ArgImp). We present CLEAR: an evaluation pipeline
consisting of 57 metrics mapped to four linguistic levels: lexical, syntactic,
semantic and pragmatic. This pipeline is used to examine the qualities of
LLM-rewritten arguments on a broad set of argumentation corpora and compare the
behavior of different LLMs on this task and analyze the behavior of different
LLMs on this task in terms of linguistic levels. By taking all four linguistic
levels into consideration, we find that the models perform ArgImp by shortening
the texts while simultaneously increasing average word length and merging
sentences. Overall we note an increase in the persuasion and coherence
dimensions.

Title: Value-Guided KV Compression for LLMs via Approximated CUR Decomposition
Authors: Ayan Sengupta, Siddhant Chaudhary and Tanmoy Chakraborty
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Key-value (KV) cache compression has emerged as a critical technique for
reducing the memory and latency overhead of autoregressive language models
during inference. Prior approaches predominantly rely on query-key attention
scores to rank and evict cached tokens, assuming that attention intensity
correlates with semantic importance. However, this heuristic overlooks the
contribution of value vectors, which directly influence the attention output.
In this paper, we propose CurDKV, a novel, value-centric KV compression method
that selects keys and values based on leverage scores computed from CUR matrix
decomposition. Our approach approximates the dominant subspace of the attention
output $softmax(QK^T)V$, ensuring that the retained tokens best preserve the
model's predictive behavior. Theoretically, we show that attention score
approximation does not guarantee output preservation, and demonstrate that
CUR-based selection minimizes end-to-end attention reconstruction loss.
Empirically, CurDKV achieves up to 9.6% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art
methods like SnapKV and ChunkKV under aggressive compression budgets on LLaMA
and Mistral, while maintaining compatibility with FlashAttention and Grouped
Query Attention. In addition to improved accuracy, CurDKV reduces generation
latency by up to 40% at high compression, offering a practical speed-accuracy
tradeoff.

  Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for low-resource languages remains a
major challenge in NLP due to the scarcity of high-quality data and
language-specific models. Maithili, despite being spoken by millions, lacks
adequate computational resources, limiting its inclusion in digital and
AI-driven applications. To address this gap, we introducemaiBERT, a BERT-based
language model pre-trained specifically for Maithili using the Masked Language
Modeling (MLM) technique. Our model is trained on a newly constructed Maithili
corpus and evaluated through a news classification task. In our experiments,
maiBERT achieved an accuracy of 87.02%, outperforming existing regional models
like NepBERTa and HindiBERT, with a 0.13% overall accuracy gain and 5-7%
improvement across various classes. We have open-sourced maiBERT on Hugging
Face enabling further fine-tuning for downstream tasks such as sentiment
analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER).

Title: LLM-OREF: An Open Relation Extraction Framework Based on Large Language
  Models
Authors: Hongyao Tu, Liang Zhang, Yujie Lin, Xin Lin, Haibo Zhang, Long Zhang,
  Jinsong Su
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The goal of open relation extraction (OpenRE) is to develop an RE model that
can generalize to new relations not encountered during training. Existing
studies primarily formulate OpenRE as a clustering task. They first cluster all
test instances based on the similarity between the instances, and then manually
assign a new relation to each cluster. However, their reliance on human
annotation limits their practicality. In this paper, we propose an OpenRE
framework based on large language models (LLMs), which directly predicts new
relations for test instances by leveraging their strong language understanding
and generation abilities, without human intervention. Specifically, our
framework consists of two core components: (1) a relation discoverer (RD),
designed to predict new relations for test instances based on
\textit{demonstrations} formed by training instances with known relations; and
(2) a relation predictor (RP), used to select the most likely relation for a
test instance from $n$ candidate relations, guided by \textit{demonstrations}
composed of their instances. To enhance the ability of our framework to predict
new relations, we design a self-correcting inference strategy composed of three
stages: relation discovery, relation denoising, and relation prediction. In the
first stage, we use RD to preliminarily predict new relations for all test
instances. Next, we apply RP to select some high-reliability test instances for
each new relation from the prediction results of RD through a cross-validation
method. During the third stage, we employ RP to re-predict the relations of all
test instances based on the demonstrations constructed from these reliable test
instances. Extensive experiments on three OpenRE datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. We release our code at

Title: Large Language Model probabilities cannot distinguish between possible
  and impossible language
Authors: Evelina Leivada, Raquel Montero, Paolo Morosi, Natalia Moskvina,
  Tamara Serrano, Marcel Aguilar, Fritz Guenther
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  A controversial test for Large Language Models concerns the ability to
discern possible from impossible language. While some evidence attests to the
models' sensitivity to what crosses the limits of grammatically impossible
language, this evidence has been contested on the grounds of the soundness of
the testing material. We use model-internal representations to tap directly
into the way Large Language Models represent the 'grammatical-ungrammatical'
distinction. In a novel benchmark, we elicit probabilities from 4 models and
compute minimal-pair surprisal differences, juxtaposing probabilities assigned
to grammatical sentences to probabilities assigned to (i) lower frequency
grammatical sentences, (ii) ungrammatical sentences, (iii) semantically odd
sentences, and (iv) pragmatically odd sentences. The prediction is that if
string-probabilities can function as proxies for the limits of grammar, the
ungrammatical condition will stand out among the conditions that involve
linguistic violations, showing a spike in the surprisal rates. Our results do
not reveal a unique surprisal signature for ungrammatical prompts, as the
semantically and pragmatically odd conditions consistently show higher
surprisal. We thus demonstrate that probabilities do not constitute reliable
proxies for model-internal representations of syntactic knowledge.
Consequently, claims about models being able to distinguish possible from
impossible language need verification through a different methodology.

  Large language models (LLMs) benefit from test-time scaling, but existing
methods face significant challenges, including severe synchronization overhead,
memory bottlenecks, and latency, especially during speculative decoding with
long reasoning chains. We introduce A1 (Asynchronous Test-Time Scaling), a
statistically guaranteed adaptive inference framework that addresses these
challenges. A1 refines arithmetic intensity to identify synchronization as the
dominant bottleneck, proposes an online calibration strategy to enable
asynchronous inference, and designs a three-stage rejection sampling pipeline
that supports both sequential and parallel scaling. Through experiments on the
MATH, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25 datasets, across various draft-target model
families, we demonstrate that A1 achieves a remarkable 56.7x speedup in
test-time scaling and a 4.14x improvement in throughput, all while maintaining
accurate rejection-rate control, reducing latency and memory overhead, and no
accuracy loss compared to using target model scaling alone. These results
position A1 as an efficient and principled solution for scalable LLM inference.

  WARNING: This paper contains examples of offensive materials. Toxic content

data-efficient two-stage framework for explainable content moderation using
Large Language Models (LLMs). In Stage 1, we leverage LLMs' own outputs to
generate synthetic explanations for both correct and incorrect labels, enabling
alignment via preference optimization with minimal human supervision. In Stage
2, we refine explanation quality through cross-model training, allowing weaker
models to align stylistically and semantically with stronger ones. Experiments
on three benchmark tasks -- HateXplain, Latent Hate, and Implicit Hate --
demonstrate that SMARTER enables LLMs to achieve up to a 13.5% macro-F1
improvement over standard few-shot baselines while using only a fraction of the
full training data. Our framework offers a scalable strategy for low-resource
settings by harnessing LLMs' self-improving capabilities for both
classification and explanation.

\\
  Autoregressive (AR) language models generate text one token at a time, which
limits their inference speed. Diffusion-based language models offer a promising
alternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we
identify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window
problem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become
irrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address
this issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and
bidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To
overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based
method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to
better fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based
Fine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at
positions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on
open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM
baselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works,
demonstrating both speed and quality improvements.

Title: Fair-GPTQ: Bias-Aware Quantization for Large Language Models
Authors: Irina Proskurina, Guillaume Metzler, Julien Velcin
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  High memory demands of generative language models have drawn attention to
quantization, which reduces computational cost, memory usage, and latency by
mapping model weights to lower-precision integers. Approaches such as GPTQ
effectively minimize input-weight product errors during quantization; however,
recent empirical studies show that they can increase biased outputs and degrade
performance on fairness benchmarks, and it remains unclear which specific
weights cause this issue. In this work, we draw new links between quantization
and model fairness by adding explicit group-fairness constraints to the
quantization objective and introduce Fair-GPTQ, the first quantization method
explicitly designed to reduce unfairness in large language models. The added
constraints guide the learning of the rounding operation toward less-biased
text generation for protected groups. Specifically, we focus on stereotype
generation involving occupational bias and discriminatory language spanning
gender, race, and religion. Fair-GPTQ has minimal impact on performance,
preserving at least 90% of baseline accuracy on zero-shot benchmarks, reduces
unfairness relative to a half-precision model, and retains the memory and speed
benefits of 4-bit quantization. We also compare the performance of Fair-GPTQ
with existing debiasing methods and find that it achieves performance on par
with the iterative null-space projection debiasing approach on
racial-stereotype benchmarks. Overall, the results validate our theoretical
solution to the quantization problem with a group-bias term, highlight its
applicability for reducing group bias at quantization time in generative
models, and demonstrate that our approach can further be used to analyze
channel- and weight-level contributions to fairness during quantization.

Title: What's the Best Way to Retrieve Slides? A Comparative Study of
  Multimodal, Caption-Based, and Hybrid Retrieval Techniques
Authors: Petros Stylianos Giouroukis, Dimitris Dimitriadis, Dimitrios

\\
  Slide decks, serving as digital reports that bridge the gap between
presentation slides and written documents, are a prevalent medium for conveying
information in both academic and corporate settings. Their multimodal nature,
combining text, images, and charts, presents challenges for retrieval-augmented
generation systems, where the quality of retrieval directly impacts downstream
performance. Traditional approaches to slide retrieval often involve separate
indexing of modalities, which can increase complexity and lose contextual
information. This paper investigates various methodologies for effective slide
retrieval, including visual late-interaction embedding models like ColPali, the
use of visual rerankers, and hybrid retrieval techniques that combine dense
retrieval with BM25, further enhanced by textual rerankers and fusion methods
like Reciprocal Rank Fusion. A novel Vision-Language Models-based captioning
pipeline is also evaluated, demonstrating significantly reduced embedding
storage requirements compared to visual late-interaction techniques, alongside
comparable retrieval performance. Our analysis extends to the practical aspects
of these methods, evaluating their runtime performance and storage demands
alongside retrieval efficacy, thus offering practical guidance for the
selection and development of efficient and robust slide retrieval systems for
real-world applications.

\\
  Traditional efforts to measure historical structural oppression struggle with
cross-national validity due to the unique, locally specified histories of
exclusion, colonization, and social status in each country, and often have
relied on structured indices that privilege material resources while
overlooking lived, identity-based exclusion. We introduce a novel framework for
oppression measurement that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
context-sensitive scores of lived historical disadvantage across diverse
geopolitical settings. Using unstructured self-identified ethnicity utterances
from a multilingual COVID-19 global study, we design rule-guided prompting
strategies that encourage models to produce interpretable, theoretically
grounded estimations of oppression. We systematically evaluate these strategies
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, when
guided by explicit rules, can capture nuanced forms of identity-based
historical oppression within nations. This approach provides a complementary
measurement tool that highlights dimensions of systemic exclusion, offering a
scalable, cross-cultural lens for understanding how oppression manifests in
data-driven research and public health contexts. To support reproducible
evaluation, we release an open-sourced benchmark dataset for assessing LLMs on
oppression measurement

Title: LNE-Blocking: An Efficient Framework for Contamination Mitigation
  Evaluation on Large Language Models
Authors: Ruijie Hou, Yueyang Jiao, Hanxu Hu, Yingming Li, Wai Lam, Huajian
  Zhang, Hongyuan Lu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The problem of data contamination is now almost inevitable during the
development of large language models (LLMs), with the training data commonly
integrating those evaluation benchmarks even unintentionally. This problem
subsequently makes it hard to benchmark LLMs fairly. Instead of constructing
contamination-free datasets (quite hard), we propose a novel framework,
\textbf{LNE-Blocking}, to restore model performance prior to contamination on
potentially leaked datasets. Our framework consists of two components:
contamination detection and disruption operation. For the prompt, the framework
first uses the contamination detection method, \textbf{LNE}, to assess the
extent of contamination in the model. Based on this, it adjusts the intensity
of the disruption operation, \textbf{Blocking}, to elicit non-memorized
responses from the model. Our framework is the first to efficiently restore the
model's greedy decoding performance. This comes with a strong performance on
multiple datasets with potential leakage risks, and it consistently achieves
stable recovery results across different models and varying levels of data
contamination. We release the code at https://github.com/RuijieH/LNE-Blocking
to facilitate research.

Title: Class-invariant Test-Time Augmentation for Domain Generalization
Authors: Zhicheng Lin, Xiaolin Wu, Xi Zhang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under
distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this
challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior
approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time
adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight
test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant
Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple
variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that
nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions
are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove
unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and
trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets
demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones,
highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

\\
  We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both
high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos,
and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either
reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these
diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and
modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer
architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of
arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we
introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and
Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By
employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from
single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent
tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01
rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9%
classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both
visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete
tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding
tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all
benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI
systems built upon unified visual tokenization.

Title: MemEvo: Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering
Authors: Zisen Kong, Bo Zhong, Pengyuan Li, Dongxia Chang, Yiming Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Incremental multi-view clustering aims to achieve stable clustering results
while addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma (SPD) in incremental views.
At the core of SPD is the challenge that the model must have enough plasticity
to quickly adapt to new data, while maintaining sufficient stability to
consolidate long-term knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inspired
by the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex collaborative memory mechanism in
neuroscience, we propose a Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering
method (MemEvo) to achieve this balance. First, we propose a
hippocampus-inspired view alignment module that captures the gain information
of new views by aligning structures in continuous representations. Second, we
introduce a cognitive forgetting mechanism that simulates the decay patterns of
human memory to modulate the weights of historical knowledge. Additionally, we
design a prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation memory module that
leverages temporal tensor stability to gradually consolidate historical
knowledge. By integrating these modules, MemEvo achieves strong knowledge
retention capabilities in scenarios with a growing number of views. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MemEvo exhibits remarkable advantages over
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Edge-Aware Normalized Attention for Efficient and Detail-Preserving
  Single Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Penghao Rao, Tieyong Zeng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 13 pages
MSC-class: 68T45, 68T07, 68U10
\\
  Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains highly ill-posed because
recovering structurally faithful high-frequency content from a single
low-resolution observation is ambiguous. Existing edge-aware methods often
attach edge priors or attention branches onto increasingly complex backbones,
yet ad hoc fusion frequently introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or
limited structural gains. We address this gap with an edge-guided attention
mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge
features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and
reweight responses, selectively amplifying structurally salient regions while
suppressing spurious textures. In parallel, we integrate this mechanism into a
lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective combining
pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial terms to balance fidelity, perceptual
realism, and training stability. Extensive experiments on standard SISR
benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and
perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at
comparable model complexity. The proposed formulation provides (i) a
parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, (ii) stabilized adversarial
refinement through a tailored multiterm loss, and (iii) enhanced edge fidelity
without resorting to deeper or heavily overparameterized architectures. These
results highlight the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation
for advancing perceptual super-resolution.

Title: Adaptive and Iterative Point Cloud Denoising with Score-Based Diffusion
  Model
Authors: Zhaonan Wang, Manyi Li, ShiQing Xin, and Changhe Tu
Categories: cs.CV
DOI: 10.1111/cgf.70149
\\
  Point cloud denoising task aims to recover the clean point cloud from the
scanned data coupled with different levels or patterns of noise. The recent
state-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point
locations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising
process several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear
how to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with
different levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
and iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion
model. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and
determine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then
invoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the
adaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process,
we design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the
network training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative
denoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our
approach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the
shape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other
methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the
synthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the
real-scanned dataset.

Title: DiffVL: Diffusion-Based Visual Localization on 2D Maps via
  BEV-Conditioned GPS Denoising
Authors: Li Gao, Hongyang Sun, Liu Liu, Yunhao Li, Yang Cai
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing
methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide
high-precision localization references, their costly construction and
maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward
standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based
approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and
maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily
available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose
DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS
denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS
trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly
encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative
diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g.,
OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse
GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals,
achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that
diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a
generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based
methods.

\\
  Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction is fundamentally
challenging due to undersampling, leading to an ill-posed inverse problem.
Traditional iterative methods incorporate handcrafted or learned priors to
regularize the solution but struggle to capture the complex structures present
in medical images. In contrast, diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as
powerful generative priors that can accurately model complex image
distributions. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium
(DICE), a framework that integrates a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the
sampling process of a DM. DICE alternates between: (i) a data-consistency
agent, implemented through a proximal operator enforcing measurement
consistency, and (ii) a prior agent, realized by a DM performing a clean image
estimation at each sampling step. By balancing these two complementary agents
iteratively, DICE effectively combines strong generative prior capabilities
with measurement consistency. Experimental results show that DICE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstructing high-quality CT images
under uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings of 15, 30, and 60 views (out
of a total of 180), demonstrating both its effectiveness and robustness.

  The development of methods to estimate the severity of Ulcerative Colitis
(UC) is of significant importance. However, these methods often suffer from
domain shifts caused by differences in imaging devices and clinical settings
across hospitals. Although several domain adaptation methods have been proposed
to address domain shift, they still struggle with the lack of supervision in
the target domain or the high cost of annotation. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method that leverages
patient-level diagnostic results, which are routinely recorded in UC diagnosis,
as weak supervision in the target domain. The proposed method aligns class-wise
distributions across domains using Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity
Triplet Loss, which leverages the characteristic that patient-level diagnoses
are determined by the most severe region within each patient. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparative DA approaches,
improving UC severity estimation in a domain-shifted setting.

Title: Do Vision-Language Models See Urban Scenes as People Do? An Urban

Authors: Rashid Mushkani
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI

  Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We
introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban
perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs
and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community
groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical
attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to
English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt
and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard
overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and
pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible,
objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet)
reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human
agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower
scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible,
uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

Title: Feature-aligned Motion Transformation for Efficient Dynamic Point Cloud
  Compression
Authors: Xuan Deng, Xiandong Meng, Longguang Wang, Tiange Zhang, Xiaopeng Fan,
  Debin Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 9 pages
\\
  Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive
reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely
depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular
structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task
highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation,
whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully
exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud
compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal
alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using
aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding
framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that
enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby
supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding
efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly
improving compression efficiency and processing performance.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In the domain of 3D biomedical image segmentation, Mamba exhibits the
superior performance for it addresses the limitations in modeling long-range
dependencies inherent to CNNs and mitigates the abundant computational overhead
associated with Transformer-based frameworks when processing high-resolution
medical volumes. However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling
may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus
leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs.
Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual
complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively
integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to
harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a
gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual
modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer.
Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly

Title: Enhancing Feature Fusion of U-like Networks with Dynamic Skip
  Connections
Authors: Yue Cao, Quansong He, Kaishen Wang, Jianlong Xiong, Tao He
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image
segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and
low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections
exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature
constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of
feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is
transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The
intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale
feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global
contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer
connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two
complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module
addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden
representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature
refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the
intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on
global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature
integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly
incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across
CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like
networks.

  Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the
scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and
long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified
framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data
diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC)
module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches
are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to
preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal
convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an
Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and
restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution
shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves
state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4%

  Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with
challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing
datasets are limited. Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains
noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model
capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality
image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a
diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer
operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex
semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We
employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions
and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our
MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated
editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively
preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe
MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse

Comments: Accepted for presentation at ICONIP2025
\\
  In this study, we consider the problem of generating visual explanations in
visual foundation models. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose;
however, they often cannot be applied to complex models due to their lack of
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel explanation
generation method in visual foundation models that is aimed at both generating
explanations and partially updating model parameters to enhance
interpretability. Our approach introduces two novel mechanisms: Attention
Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA). ALA mechanism
simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual layer selection, thus
enhancing the model's adaptability and interpretability. Moreover, the AEA
mechanism, which updates ALA's parameters every other epoch, effectively
addresses the common issue of overly small attention regions. We evaluated our
method on two benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S. Our results
showed that our method outperformed the baseline methods in terms of mean
intersection over union (IoU), insertion score, deletion score, and
insertion-deletion score on both the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets.
Notably, our best model achieved a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset compared with the baselines.

  Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the
labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including
image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy
but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To
address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages
foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our
method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with
high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature
extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex
Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this
constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images,
achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available
at https://github.com/kzmngt/DACoN.

Title: FMGS-Avatar: Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian Splatting with Foundation Model
  Priors for 3D Monocular Avatar Reconstruction
Authors: Jinlong Fan and Bingyu Hu and Xingguang Li and Yuxiang Yang and Jing
  Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos
remains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view
observations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise,
they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of
3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and
information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that
integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian
Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh
faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior
surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage
foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to
complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when
distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting
optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct
parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training
strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to
optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination
of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our
approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared
to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance
fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled
prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and
temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.

Title: Chain-of-Thought Re-ranking for Image Retrieval Tasks
Authors: Shangrong Wu, Yanghong Zhou, Yang Chen, Feng Zhang, P. Y. Mok
Categories: cs.CV cs.IR
\\
  Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer
vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ
them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking
process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain
underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.
Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly
participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in
an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with
users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method
supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable
decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To
enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query
deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple
semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR),
composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our
code is available at https://github.com/freshfish15/CoTRR .

  Finding smell references in historic artworks is a challenging problem.
Beyond artwork-specific challenges such as stylistic variations, their
recognition demands exceptionally detailed annotation classes, resulting in
annotation sparsity and extreme class imbalance. In this work, we explore the
potential of synthetic data generation to alleviate these issues and enable
accurate detection of smell-related objects. We evaluate several
diffusion-based augmentation strategies and demonstrate that incorporating
synthetic data into model training can improve detection performance. Our
findings suggest that leveraging the large-scale pretraining of diffusion
models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy,
particularly in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to
obtain. Furthermore, the proposed approach proves to be effective even with
relatively small amounts of data, and scaling it up provides high potential for
further enhancements.

Title: Frame Sampling Strategies Matter: A Benchmark for small vision language
  models
Authors: Marija Brkic, Anas Filali Razzouki, Yannis Tevissen, Khalil Guetari,

Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
\\
  Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the
performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation
capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current
video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias,
as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this
work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small
VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling
strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both
data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different
frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide
the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video
VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored
to each benchmarking dataset in future research.

Title: A Real-Time Multi-Model Parametric Representation of Point Clouds
Authors: Yuan Gao, Wei Dong
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely
applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot
collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are
computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time
methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of
freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this
problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface
detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is
first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat
clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be
easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.
Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary
description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public
datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the
state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.
Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian
mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

Title: Dataset Distillation for Super-Resolution without Class Labels and
  Pre-trained Models
Authors: Sunwoo Cho, Yejin Jung, Nam Ik Cho, and Jae Woong Soh
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring
large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model
complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data
efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field
of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training
datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative
adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR
was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the
current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific
information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these
issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does
not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract
high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then
fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution
and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less
training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we
train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original
dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model
fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much
shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

Title: Radiology Report Conditional 3D CT Generation with Multi Encoder Latent
  diffusion Model

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Text to image latent diffusion models have recently advanced medical image
synthesis, but applications to 3D CT generation remain limited. Existing
approaches rely on simplified prompts, neglecting the rich semantic detail in
full radiology reports, which reduces text image alignment and clinical
fidelity. We propose Report2CT, a radiology report conditional latent diffusion
framework for synthesizing 3D chest CT volumes directly from free text
radiology reports, incorporating both findings and impression sections using
multiple text encoder. Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text
encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced
clinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a
3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset.
Model performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real
synthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic
alignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against
GenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with
excellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning
improved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical
details in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further
enhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the
VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved
state of the art performance across all evaluation metrics. By leveraging
complete radiology reports and multi encoder text conditioning, Report2CT
advances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high quality
synthetic data.

\\
  For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually
limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle
the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we
propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for
bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly
to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic
knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the
intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges
without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces
mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can
be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size
to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and
fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and
improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned
problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a
broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides
insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

  Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is fundamental to neuroimage analysis, enabling morphological studies of the
cerebral cortex and functional brain mapping. Recent advances in learning-based
CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions
through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However,
ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy
and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this
work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a
regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used
Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and
demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training
consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and

  Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection
and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a
diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The
applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods
rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and
focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and
left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a
multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient
records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design,
which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the
upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions,
including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be
visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients,
the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8%
in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

  To maintain an overview of urban conditions, city administrations manage
databases of objects like traffic signs and trees, complete with their
geocoordinates. Incidents such as graffiti or road damage are also relevant. As
digitization increases, so does the need for more data and up-to-date

MapAnything, a module that automatically determines the geocoordinates of
objects using individual images. Utilizing advanced Metric Depth Estimation
models, MapAnything calculates geocoordinates based on the object's distance

validate the module, providing recommendations for automating urban object and
incident mapping. Our evaluation measures the accuracy of estimated distances
against LiDAR point clouds in urban environments, analyzing performance across
distance intervals and semantic areas like roads and vegetation. The module's
effectiveness is demonstrated through practical use cases involving traffic

Title: Not All Degradations Are Equal: A Targeted Feature Denoising Framework
  for Generalizable Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Hongjun Wang, Jiyuan Chen, Zhengwei Yin, Xuan Song, Yinqiang Zheng
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization
capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are
expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting
degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature
Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit
degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have
assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG),
while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models
predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct
degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we
propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and
denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be
seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring
architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance
compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional
benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

Title: MARIC: Multi-Agent Reasoning for Image Classification
Authors: Wonduk Seo, Minhyeong Yu, Hyunjin An, Seunghyun Lee
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL cs.MA
Comments: Preprint
\\
  Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model
training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to
achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs)
alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on
single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of
visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for
Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image
classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an
Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted
prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained
descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent
synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,
producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly
decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective
synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training
and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification
benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and
interpretable image classification.

Title: Controllable Localized Face Anonymization Via Diffusion Inpainting
Authors: Ali Salar, Qing Liu, Guoying Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The growing use of portrait images in computer vision highlights the need to
protect personal identities. At the same time, anonymized images must remain
useful for downstream computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a unified
framework that leverages the inpainting ability of latent diffusion models to
generate realistic anonymized images. Unlike prior approaches, we have complete
control over the anonymization process by designing an adaptive
attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during the reverse
denoising process, aligning the facial attributes of the generated image with
those of the synthesized target image. Our framework also supports localized
anonymization, allowing users to specify which facial regions are left
unchanged. Extensive experiments conducted on the public CelebA-HQ and FFHQ
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while
requiring no additional model training. The source code is available on our

  Effective therapy decisions require models that predict the individual
response to treatment. This is challenging since the progression of disease and
response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to
learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging
data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients
undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent
space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task
model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the
comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the
publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory
space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0),
0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points
(T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.

Title: NeRF-based Visualization of 3D Cues Supporting Data-Driven Spacecraft
  Pose Estimation
Authors: Antoine Legrand, Renaud Detry, Christophe De Vleeschouwer
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: under review (8 pages, 2 figures)
\\
  On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e.,
position and orientation, between a chaser spacecraft and its target. While
data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their
adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their
decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues
on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based
image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation
network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited
by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our
method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional
insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision
and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

  2025 VOS Track
Authors: An Yan, Leilei Cao, Feng Lu, Ran Hong, Youhai Jiang and Fengjie Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Complex Video Object Segmentation (VOS) presents significant challenges in
accurately segmenting objects across frames, especially in the presence of
small and similar targets, frequent occlusions, rapid motion, and complex
interactions. In this report, we present our solution for the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track based on the SAM2 framework. We adopt a pseudo-labeling strategy during
training: a trained SAM2 checkpoint is deployed within the SAM2Long framework
to generate pseudo labels for the MOSE test set, which are then combined with
existing data for further training. For inference, the SAM2Long framework is
employed to obtain our primary segmentation results, while an open-source SeC
model runs in parallel to produce complementary predictions. A cascaded
decision mechanism dynamically integrates outputs from both models, exploiting
the temporal stability of SAM2Long and the concept-level robustness of SeC.
Benefiting from pseudo-label training and cascaded multi-model inference, our
approach achieves a J\&F score of 0.8616 on the MOSE test set -- +1.4 points
over our SAM2Long baseline -- securing the 2nd place in the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track, and demonstrating strong robustness and accuracy in long, complex video
segmentation scenarios.

Title: Trade-offs in Cross-Domain Generalization of Foundation Model Fine-Tuned
  for Biometric Applications

Comments: Accepted at the IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics

\\
  Foundation models such as CLIP have demonstrated exceptional zero- and
few-shot transfer capabilities across diverse vision tasks. However, when
fine-tuned for highly specialized biometric tasks, face recognition (FR),
morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD), these
models may suffer from over-specialization. Thus, they may lose one of their
foundational strengths, cross-domain generalization. In this work, we
systematically quantify these trade-offs by evaluating three instances of CLIP
fine-tuned for FR, MAD, and PAD. We evaluate each adapted model as well as the
original CLIP baseline on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and
linear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks. Our
results indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization,
especially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed
out that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs.
binary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The
FRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the
large-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%.
However, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching
only 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover,
the larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's
original generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that
increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization.

Title: DF-LLaVA: Unlocking MLLM's potential for Synthetic Image Detection via
  Prompt-Guided Knowledge Injection
Authors: Zhuokang Shen, Kaisen Zhang, Bohan Jia, Yuan Fang, Zhou Yu, Shaohui

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Under review
\\
  With the increasing prevalence of synthetic images, evaluating image
authenticity and locating forgeries accurately while maintaining human
interpretability remains a challenging task. Existing detection models
primarily focus on simple authenticity classification, ultimately providing
only a forgery probability or binary judgment, which offers limited explanatory
insights into image authenticity. Moreover, while MLLM-based detection methods
can provide more interpretable results, they still lag behind expert models in
terms of pure authenticity classification accuracy. To address this, we propose
DF-LLaVA, a simple yet effective framework that unlocks the intrinsic
discrimination potential of MLLMs. Our approach first extracts latent knowledge
from MLLMs and then injects it into training via prompts. This framework allows
LLaVA to achieve outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while
still maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs. Extensive experiments
confirm the superiority of our DF-LLaVA, achieving both high accuracy and
explainability in synthetic image detection. Code is available online at:

Title: Seeing 3D Through 2D Lenses: 3D Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning via
  Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification
Authors: Xiang Tuo and Xu Xuemiao and Liu Bangzhen and Li Jinyi and Li Yong and
  He Shengfeng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ICCV2025
\\
  The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition
systems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental
learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric
misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with
2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by
texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural
cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To
address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a
framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical
spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric
Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's
intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion.
Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet
discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal
consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a
Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot
class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and
robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

  Functional Network Analysis
Authors: Junhao Jia, Yunyou Liu, Cheng Yang, Yifei Sun, Feiwei Qin, Changmiao

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful non-invasive
window into the brain's functional organization by generating complex
functional networks, typically modeled as graphs. These brain networks exhibit
a hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. However, due
to inherent spatial constraints, standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent
these hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical
performance. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-HGCN, a geometric
deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the
intrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network
hierarchy with high fidelity. Grounded in the Lorentz model, our model employs
a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to
distinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning
robust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound Fr\'echet mean for
graph readout. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric
disorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
a wide range of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines. This work pioneers a new
geometric deep learning paradigm for fMRI analysis, highlighting the immense
potential of hyperbolic GNNs in the field of computational psychiatry.

Title: RoboEye: Enhancing 2D Robotic Object Identification with Selective 3D
  Geometric Keypoint Matching
Authors: Xingwu Zhang and Guanxuan Li and Zhuocheng Zhang and Zijun Long
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.RO
\\
  The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce
makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses
substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and
a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with
diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large
viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and
reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely
on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification
framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D
reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the
first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for
generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then
estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,
preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When
invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a
3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a
keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences
between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity
scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior
state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,
avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code
used in this paper is publicly available at:

  Point Cloud Masked Autoencoders
Authors: Xuanhua Yin, Dingxin Zhang, Yu Feng, Shunqi Mao, Jianhui Yu, Weidong

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, aceppted by DICTA 2025
\\
  Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders (MAE) rely on
random masking strategies that overlook geometric structure and semantic
coherence. Random masking treats patches independently, failing to capture
spatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic
object parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a
dual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive
Semantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates
structured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric
relationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic
masking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful
parts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams
are orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing
from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. Designed as plug-and-play
components, our strategies integrate into existing rotation-invariant
frameworks without architectural changes, ensuring broad compatibility across
different approaches. Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,
and OmniObject3D demonstrate consistent improvements across various rotation
scenarios, showing substantial performance gains over the baseline
rotation-invariant methods.

Title: EchoVLM: Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts Vision-Language Model for Universal
  Ultrasound Intelligence
Authors: Chaoyin She, Ruifang Lu, Lida Chen, Wei Wang, Qinghua Huang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer
screening due to its advantages of non-ionizing radiation, low cost, and
real-time imaging capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis
heavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high
subjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer
promising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models
demonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor
generalization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across
multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a
vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The
model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning
seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple
tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual
question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM
achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and
ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report
generation task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential
to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a
viable technical solution for future clinical applications. Source code and
model weights are available at https://github.com/Asunatan/EchoVLM.

  Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for
applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D
modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in
generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often
face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency,
and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality
dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a
comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes
with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this
dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model
that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a
3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model
synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and
semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while
preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently
generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are
open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the
field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

Title: PRISM: Product Retrieval In Shopping Carts using Hybrid Matching
Authors: Arda Kabadayi, Senem Velipasalar, Jiajing Chen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail
settings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different
brands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be
taken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored
catalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to
distinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching
methods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur
prohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid
method, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging
the advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching
approaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval
accuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP)
is employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products
from a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a
segmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3)
fine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the
filtered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination
between products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual
cues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset
show that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval
methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of
real-time processing for practical retail deployments.

  In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use
in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus
on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's
ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in
highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data
generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term,
while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the
BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid
footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate
qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under
increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82. 5\% by survey participants.

  Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation
and personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability
to capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in
clinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and
generalizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete
inputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this,
we propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for
missing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of
three synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module
explicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and
modality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The
Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge
from teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial
feature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior
probabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task,
effectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive
experiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM
consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation
accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality
configurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six
categories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of
knowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and
future research. Our source code is available at

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to NeurIPS 2025
\\
  Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image
editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in
hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these
methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent
hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification,
\textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge
hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's
hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion
denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework,
which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts
hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a
reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy
optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations.
Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational
overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical
deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

  This paper addresses the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection,
focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect a specific object (a soup can)
using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The methodology
involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition,
and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high,
they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently,
models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of
predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to
guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle
competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity,
specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined
with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain
gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded
and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's
hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only
training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully
capturing real-world variability.

  This study evaluates publicly available deep-learning based lung segmentation
models in transplant-eligible patients to determine their performance across
disease severity levels, pathology categories, and lung sides, and to identify
limitations impacting their use in preoperative planning in lung
transplantation. This retrospective study included 32 patients who underwent
chest CT scans at Duke University Health System between 2017 and 2019 (total of
3,645 2D axial slices). Patients with standard axial CT scans were selected
based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung
segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning
models: Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Performance was assessed using
quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient,
Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical
acceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and
MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories
(p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to
moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05),
without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231
provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models
with TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined
significantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized
model fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.

  Recent research on representation learning has proved the merits of
multi-modal clues for robust semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, a flexible
pretrain-and-finetune pipeline for multiple visual modalities remains
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework,
termed OmniSegmentor. It has two key innovations: 1) Based on ImageNet, we
assemble a large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining, called ImageNeXt,
which contains five popular visual modalities. 2) We provide an efficient
pretraining manner to endow the model with the capacity to encode different
modality information in the ImageNeXt. For the first time, we introduce a
universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently amplifies the
model's perceptual capabilities across various scenarios, regardless of the
arbitrary combination of the involved modalities. Remarkably, our OmniSegmentor
achieves new state-of-the-art records on a wide range of multi-modal semantic
segmentation datasets, including NYU Depthv2, EventScape, MFNet, DeLiVER,
SUNRGBD, and KITTI-360.

Title: RGB-Only Supervised Camera Parameter Optimization in Dynamic Scenes
Authors: Fang Li, Hao Zhang, Narendra Ahuja
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: NeurIPS 2025
\\
  Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter
optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and
reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes.
Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as
supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera
poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually
captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate
and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised
by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1)
Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse
hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint
Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive
down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A
Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by
a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We
visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate
accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and
assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform
experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics)
and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates
camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as
the only supervision.

  Ensuring factual consistency and reliable reasoning remains a critical
challenge for medical vision-language models. We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a
two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with
reinforcement learning to improve the factual medical reasoning. The first
stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external
factual expertise; while the second stage applies Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with four tailored factual reward signals to encourage
self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks,
MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over
previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of
pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward,

Title: Leveraging Geometric Visual Illusions as Perceptual Inductive Biases for
  Vision Models
Authors: Haobo Yang, Minghao Guo, Dequan Yang, Wenyu Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in
image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within
large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly
from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated
inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions
well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification
training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric
geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies
that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification
objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i)
incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically
improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving
intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive
biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered
unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity
of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a
novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new
directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.

Title: AIP: Subverting Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Adversarial
  Instructional Prompt
Authors: Saket S. Chaturvedi, Gaurav Bagwe, Lan Zhang, Xiaoyong Yuan
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
Comments: Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Conference
\\
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy
and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within
the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have
exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,
which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.
This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional
prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their
implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG
behavior covertly.
  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that
exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly
altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the
instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface
components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted
to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,
to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across
diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that
simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the
discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.
Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to
evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and
stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR
while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and
previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to
reassess the shared instructional prompts.

Title: Semi-Supervised 3D Medical Segmentation from 2D Natural Images

\\
  This paper explores the transfer of knowledge from general vision models
pretrained on 2D natural images to improve 3D medical image segmentation. We
focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical
images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle
this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills
knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from
scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models
using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning
rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and
unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction
accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate
pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets
demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different
settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic,
allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its
adaptability as more advanced models emerge. The code is available at

Title: A Race Bias Free Face Aging Model for Reliable Kinship Verification
Authors: Ali Nazari, Bardiya Kariminia, and Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghaddam
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the
photos of the parent and the child. Moreover, their same-age photos are often
unavailable, and face aging models are racially biased, which impacts the
likeness of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN,
consisting of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially
unbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship
verification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child
images. The experiments demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an
average of 13.14\% across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by
9.1\% in terms of racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjects'
identities better than SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups.
Additionally, we demonstrate that transforming parent and child images from the
KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets to the same age can enhance the
verification accuracy across all age groups. The accuracy increases with our
RA-GAN for the kinship relationships of father-son and father-daughter,
mother-son, and mother-daughter, which are 5.22, 5.12, 1.63, and 0.41,
respectively, on KinFaceW-I. Additionally, the accuracy for the relationships
of father-daughter, father-son, and mother-son is 2.9, 0.39, and 1.6 on
KinFaceW-II, respectively. The code is available

Title: Unleashing the Potential of Multimodal LLMs for Zero-Shot
  Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding
Authors: Zaiquan Yang, Yuhao Liu, Gerhard Hancke, Rynson W.H. Lau
Categories: cs.CV
Journal-ref: NeurIPS2025
\\
  Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal
tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we
utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot
solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to
dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens},
for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal
grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query
(\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we
propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel
decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented
assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH
strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action
sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and
temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to
learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token
predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action
cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and
temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the
attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS
strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the
temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We
evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods
on three common STVG benchmarks.

Title: Maize Seedling Detection Dataset (MSDD): A Curated High-Resolution RGB
  Dataset for Seedling Maize Detection and Benchmarking with YOLOv9, YOLO11,
  YOLOv12 and Faster-RCNN

  Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP) Special Series on Artificial Intelligence

\\
  Accurate maize seedling detection is crucial for precision agriculture, yet
curated datasets remain scarce. We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image
dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season
crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting
determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as
replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and
error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD
contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse
growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles,
and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows
detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among
tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for
single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall
up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity
and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further
reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11
maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for
saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that
enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time
decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural
monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by NeurIPS 2025
\\
  Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of high-quality visual
representations in image generation and have highlighted the limitations of
generative models in image understanding. As a generative paradigm originally
designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges.
In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms
of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We
identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual
semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency,
and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively
addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to
a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models
(ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR
significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models
and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings
approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for
LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.

  Synchronization is the task of estimating and inverting geometric
transformations (e.g., crop, rotation) applied to an image. This work
introduces SyncSeal, a bespoke watermarking method for robust image
synchronization, which can be applied on top of existing watermarking methods
to enhance their robustness against geometric transformations. It relies on an
embedder network that imperceptibly alters images and an extractor network that
predicts the geometric transformation to which the image was subjected. Both
networks are end-to-end trained to minimize the error between the predicted and
ground-truth parameters of the transformation, combined with a discriminator to
maintain high perceptual quality. We experimentally validate our method on a
wide variety of geometric and valuemetric transformations, demonstrating its
effectiveness in accurately synchronizing images. We further show that our
synchronization can effectively upgrade existing watermarking methods to
withstand geometric transformations to which they were previously vulnerable.

  This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built
upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We
propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric
Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric
manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame
and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware
Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories,
thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction.
Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a
variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact
latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When
finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the
proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA
models.

  Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous
systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and
virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free
observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight
objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera
coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised
trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable
prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present
advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the
noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.
Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight
Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending
its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual
reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera
calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of
visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an
unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB
datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory
denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.
Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such
as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,
providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative
to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor
trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances. The

\\
  To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based
multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation
and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the
computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then
gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve
great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion
models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In
this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models
in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion
process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we
design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve
efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net
and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling
strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence
estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two
novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive
performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory.
CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and
ETH3D. Code is available at: https://github.com/cvg/diffmvs.

  Event cameras capture sparse, high-temporal-resolution visual information,
making them particularly suitable for challenging environments with high-speed
motion and strongly varying lighting conditions. However, the lack of large
datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based
monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we
propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels
leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event
stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available
off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally,
we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2),
or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from
monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world
datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive
performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive
depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

  Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse medical imaging tasks by leveraging large-scale
image-text pretraining. However, their confidence calibration is largely
unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated
predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and
decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the
first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt
optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration
objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that
attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences.
Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature
proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of
multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs
and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently
improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy. Our code is

  The field of distributed machine learning (ML) faces increasing demands for
scalable and cost-effective training solutions, particularly in the context of
large, complex models. Serverless computing has emerged as a promising paradigm
to address these challenges by offering dynamic scalability and
resource-efficient execution. Building upon our previous work, which introduced
the Serverless Peer Integrated for Robust Training (SPIRT) architecture, this
paper presents a comparative analysis of several serverless distributed ML
architectures. We examine SPIRT alongside established architectures like
ScatterReduce, AllReduce, and MLLess, focusing on key metrics such as training
time efficiency, cost-effectiveness, communication overhead, and fault
tolerance capabilities. Our findings reveal that SPIRT provides significant
improvements in reducing training times and communication overhead through
strategies such as parallel batch processing and in-database operations
facilitated by RedisAI. However, traditional architectures exhibit scalability
challenges and varying degrees of vulnerability to faults and adversarial
attacks. The cost analysis underscores the long-term economic benefits of SPIRT
despite its higher initial setup costs. This study not only highlights the
strengths and limitations of current serverless ML architectures but also sets
the stage for future research aimed at developing new models that combine the
most effective features of existing systems.

\\
  Wireless channels in motion-rich urban microcell (UMi) settings are
non-stationary; mobility and scatterer dynamics shift the distribution over
time, degrading classical and deep estimators. This work proposes conditional
prior diffusion for channel estimation, which learns a history-conditioned
score to denoise noisy channel snapshots. A temporal encoder with cross-time
attention compresses a short observation window into a context vector, which
captures the channel's instantaneous coherence and steers the denoiser via
feature-wise modulation. In inference, an SNR-matched initialization selects
the diffusion step whose marginal aligns with the measured input SNR, and the
process follows a shortened, geometrically spaced schedule, preserving the
signal-to-noise trajectory with far fewer iterations. Temporal
self-conditioning with the previous channel estimate and a training-only
smoothness penalty further stabilizes evolution without biasing the test-time
estimator. Evaluations on a 3GPP benchmark show lower NMSE across all SNRs than

  Modern wireless networks face critical challenges when mobile users traverse
heterogeneous network configurations with varying antenna layouts, carrier
frequencies, and scattering statistics. Traditional predictors degrade under
distribution shift, with NMSE rising by 37.5\% during cross-configuration
handovers. This work addresses catastrophic forgetting in channel prediction by
proposing a continual learning framework based on loss regularization. The
approach augments standard training objectives with penalty terms that
selectively preserve network parameters essential for previous configurations
while enabling adaptation to new environments. Two prominent regularization
strategies are investigated: Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Synaptic
Intelligence (SI). Across 3GPP scenarios and multiple architectures, SI lowers
the high-SNR NMSE floor by up to 1.8 dB ($\approx$32--34\%), while EWC achieves
up to 1.4 dB ($\approx$17--28\%). Notably, standard EWC incurs
$\mathcal{O}(MK)$ complexity (storing $M$ Fisher diagonal entries and
corresponding parameter snapshots across $K$ tasks) unless consolidated,
whereas SI maintains $\mathcal{O}(M)$ memory complexity (storing $M$ model
parameters), independent of task sequence length, making it suitable for
resource-constrained wireless infrastructure

Title: Constructive Conflict-Driven Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for
  Strategic Diversity
Authors: Yuxiang Mai, Qiyue Yin, Wancheng Ni, Pei Xu, Kaiqi Huang
Categories: cs.MA cs.AI
Comments: Accepted by IJCAI 2025
\\
  In recent years, diversity has emerged as a useful mechanism to enhance the
efficiency of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing
methods predominantly focus on designing policies based on individual agent
characteristics, often neglecting the interplay and mutual influence among
agents during policy formation. To address this gap, we propose Competitive
Diversity through Constructive Conflict (CoDiCon), a novel approach that
incorporates competitive incentives into cooperative scenarios to encourage
policy exchange and foster strategic diversity among agents. Drawing
inspiration from sociological research, which highlights the benefits of
moderate competition and constructive conflict in group decision-making, we
design an intrinsic reward mechanism using ranking features to introduce
competitive motivations. A centralized intrinsic reward module generates and
distributes varying reward values to agents, ensuring an effective balance
between competition and cooperation. By optimizing the parameterized
centralized reward module to maximize environmental rewards, we reformulate the
constrained bilevel optimization problem to align with the original task
objectives. We evaluate our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods in the
SMAC and GRF environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDiCon
achieves superior performance, with competitive intrinsic rewards effectively
promoting diverse and adaptive strategies among cooperative agents.

  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) holds substantial promise for
intelligent decision-making in complex environments. However, it suffers from a
coordination and scalability bottleneck as the number of agents increases. To
address these issues, we propose the LLM-empowered expert demonstrations
framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (LEED). LEED consists of two
components: a demonstration generation (DG) module and a policy optimization
(PO) module. Specifically, the DG module leverages large language models to
generate instructions for interacting with the environment, thereby producing
high-quality demonstrations. The PO module adopts a decentralized training
paradigm, where each agent utilizes the generated demonstrations to construct
an expert policy loss, which is then integrated with its own policy loss. This
enables each agent to effectively personalize and optimize its local policy
based on both expert knowledge and individual experience. Experimental results
show that LEED achieves superior sample efficiency, time efficiency, and robust
scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

  Partial agent failure becomes inevitable when systems scale up, making it
crucial to identify the subset of agents whose compromise would most severely
degrade overall performance. In this paper, we study this Vulnerable Agent
Identification (VAI) problem in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL). We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field
Control (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task
of selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case
adversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL. The two problems
are coupled together, making HAD-MFC difficult to solve. To solve this, we
first decouple the hierarchical process by Fenchel-Rockafellar transform,
resulting a regularized mean-field Bellman operator for upper level that
enables independent learning at each level, thus reducing computational
complexity. We then reformulate the upper-level combinatorial problem as a MDP
with dense rewards from our regularized mean-field Bellman operator, enabling
us to sequentially identify the most vulnerable agents by greedy and RL
algorithms. This decomposition provably preserves the optimal solution of the
original HAD-MFC. Experiments show our method effectively identifies more
vulnerable agents in large-scale MARL and the rule-based system, fooling system
into worse failures, and learns a value function that reveals the vulnerability
of each agent.

Title: Evolution of Kernels: Automated RISC-V Kernel Optimization with Large
  Language Models
Authors: Siyuan Chen and Zhichao Lu and Qingfu Zhang
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
Comments: Technical report
\\
  Automated kernel design is critical for overcoming software ecosystem
barriers in emerging hardware platforms like RISC-V. While large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated kernel optimization,
demonstrating success in CUDA domains with comprehensive technical documents
and mature codebases, their effectiveness remains unproven for reference-scarce
domains like RISC-V. We present Evolution of Kernels (EoK), a novel LLM-based
evolutionary program search framework that automates kernel design for domains
with limited reference material. EoK mitigates reference scarcity by mining and
formalizing reusable optimization ideas (general design principles + actionable
thoughts) from established kernel libraries' development histories; it then
guides parallel LLM explorations using these ideas, enriched via
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with RISC-V-specific context, prioritizing
historically effective techniques. Empirically, EoK achieves a median 1.27x
speedup, surpassing human experts on all 80 evaluated kernel design tasks and
improving upon prior LLM-based automated kernel design methods by 20%. These
results underscore the viability of incorporating human experience into
emerging domains and highlight the immense potential of LLM-based automated
kernel optimization.

  Large Language Models have demonstrated significant promise in formal theorem
proving. However, previous works mainly focus on solving existing problems. In
this paper, we focus on the ability of LLMs to find novel theorems. We propose
Conjecturing-Proving Loop pipeline for automatically generating mathematical
conjectures and proving them in Lean 4 format. A feature of our approach is
that we generate and prove further conjectures with context including
previously generated theorems and their proofs, which enables the generation of
more difficult proofs by in-context learning of proof strategies without
changing parameters of LLMs. We demonstrated that our framework rediscovered
theorems with verification, which were published in past mathematical papers
and have not yet formalized. Moreover, at least one of these theorems could not
be proved by the LLM without in-context learning, even in natural language,
which means that in-context learning was effective for neural theorem proving.

Title: FedMentor: Domain-Aware Differential Privacy for Heterogeneous Federated
  LLMs in Mental Health
Authors: Nobin Sarwar, Shubhashis Roy Dipta

Comments: (e.g.: 18 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables)
\\
  Privacy-preserving adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive
domains (e.g., mental health) requires balancing strict confidentiality with
model utility and safety. We propose FedMentor, a federated fine-tuning
framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and domain-aware
Differential Privacy (DP) to meet per-domain privacy budgets while maintaining
performance. Each client (domain) applies a custom DP noise scale proportional
to its data sensitivity, and the server adaptively reduces noise when utility
falls below a threshold. In experiments on three mental health datasets, we
show that FedMentor improves safety over standard Federated Learning without
privacy, raising safe output rates by up to three points and lowering toxicity,
while maintaining utility (BERTScore F1 and ROUGE-L) within 0.5% of the
non-private baseline and close to the centralized upper bound. The framework
scales to backbones with up to 1.7B parameters on single-GPU clients, requiring
< 173 MB of communication per round. FedMentor demonstrates a practical
approach to privately fine-tune LLMs for safer deployments in healthcare and
other sensitive fields.

Title: Beyond Data Privacy: New Privacy Risks for Large Language Models

Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language understanding, reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. However,
these advancements have also come with significant privacy concerns. While
significant research has focused on mitigating the data privacy risks of LLMs
during various stages of model training, less attention has been paid to new
threats emerging from their deployment. The integration of LLMs into widely
used applications and the weaponization of their autonomous abilities have
created new privacy vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities provide
opportunities for both inadvertent data leakage and malicious exfiltration from
LLM-powered systems. Additionally, adversaries can exploit these systems to
launch sophisticated, large-scale privacy attacks, threatening not only
individual privacy but also financial security and societal trust. In this
paper, we systematically examine these emerging privacy risks of LLMs. We also
discuss potential mitigation strategies and call for the research community to
broaden its focus beyond data privacy risks, developing new defenses to address
the evolving threats posed by increasingly powerful LLMs and LLM-powered
systems.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their
effectiveness in scaling test-time compute for software engineering tasks.
However, these approaches often focus on high-level solutions, with limited
attention to optimizing low-level CUDA kernel implementations. Additionally,
existing kernel generation benchmarks suffer from exploitable loopholes and
insufficient diversity in testing conditions, hindering true generalization
assessment. To address these limitations, we introduce robust-kbench, a new
benchmark for rigorous evaluation of kernel performance and correctness across
varied scenarios. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive agentic framework
that automates CUDA kernel discovery, verification, and optimization. This
pipeline enables frontier LLMs to translate torch code to CUDA kernels and
iteratively improve their runtime within our robust evaluation setting. Our
sequential workflow first translates PyTorch code into equivalent CUDA kernels.
It then optimizes their runtime using a novel evolutionary meta-generation
procedure tailored to the CUDA ecosystem, guided by LLM-based verifiers for
correctness and efficient filtering. Evaluated on robust-kbench, our approach
produces CUDA kernels outperforming torch implementations for practical
applications, including forward and backward passes. It can fuse operations and
deploy various runtime optimization strategies. The verifier workflow
accurately classifies incorrect kernels, enhancing hardware verification
efficiency.

  Significant advancements have been made in the capabilities of code large
language models, leading to their rapid adoption and application across a wide
range of domains. However, their further advancements are often constrained by
the scarcity of real-world coding problems. To bridge this gap, we propose a
novel framework for synthesizing code problems that emulate authentic
real-world scenarios. This framework systematically integrates domain
knowledge, domain skills, and coding skills, all of which are meticulously
extracted from real-world programming-related datasets, including Stack
Overflow and Kaggle. The extracted elements serve as the foundational building
blocks for constructing code problems. To align the generated problems with
practical applications, application scenarios are also mined from the
aforementioned datasets. These scenarios are then utilized to construct a
scenario-centric graph that interconnects domain knowledge, domain skills, and
coding skills. Based on this structured representation, a sampling strategy on
the graph is designed, which effectively controls the generation of a code
problem with complexity and diversity, reflects real-world challenges.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art open-source large language models of
varying sizes and functionalities, including both coders and general-purpose
models, across a diverse set of real-world benchmarks.

Title: The Sum Leaks More Than Its Parts: Compositional Privacy Risks and
  Mitigations in Multi-Agent Collaboration
Authors: Vaidehi Patil, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: Code: https://github.com/Vaidehi99/MultiAgentPrivacy
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) become integral to multi-agent systems, new
privacy risks emerge that extend beyond memorization, direct inference, or
single-turn evaluations. In particular, seemingly innocuous responses, when
composed across interactions, can cumulatively enable adversaries to recover
sensitive information, a phenomenon we term compositional privacy leakage. We
present the first systematic study of such compositional privacy leaks and
possible mitigation methods in multi-agent LLM systems. First, we develop a
framework that models how auxiliary knowledge and agent interactions jointly
amplify privacy risks, even when each response is benign in isolation. Next, to
mitigate this, we propose and evaluate two defense strategies: (1)
Theory-of-Mind defense (ToM), where defender agents infer a questioner's intent
by anticipating how their outputs may be exploited by adversaries, and (2)
Collaborative Consensus Defense (CoDef), where responder agents collaborate
with peers who vote based on a shared aggregated state to restrict sensitive
information spread. Crucially, we balance our evaluation across compositions
that expose sensitive information and compositions that yield benign
inferences. Our experiments quantify how these defense strategies differ in
balancing the privacy-utility trade-off. We find that while chain-of-thought
alone offers limited protection to leakage (~39% sensitive blocking rate), our
ToM defense substantially improves sensitive query blocking (up to 97%) but can
reduce benign task success. CoDef achieves the best balance, yielding the
highest Balanced Outcome (79.8%), highlighting the benefit of combining
explicit reasoning with defender collaboration. Together, our results expose a
new class of risks in collaborative LLM deployments and provide actionable
insights for designing safeguards against compositional, context-driven privacy
leakage.

  Biological sequence design (DNA, RNA, or peptides) with desired functional
properties has applications in discovering novel nanomaterials, biosensors,
antimicrobial drugs, and beyond. One common challenge is the ability to
optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of
DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and
antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely
on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than
high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a
geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which
learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property
space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold
that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an
appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide
the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder
layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized
latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired
properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our
framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template
fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The
trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent
space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ
sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to
16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance
in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.

  Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images
to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning,
autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by
geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft,
rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic
priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features
learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance
priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose
FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable
energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to
encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware
features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as
interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples
motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion
planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing
multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that
FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3,
surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality. The project is

  Stuttered and dysfluent speech detection systems have traditionally suffered
from the trade-off between accuracy and clinical interpretability. While
end-to-end deep learning models achieve high performance, their black-box
nature limits clinical adoption. This paper looks at the Unconstrained
Dysfluency Modeling (UDM) series-the current state-of-the-art framework

Through extensive experiments involving patients and certified speech-language

performance (F1: 0.89+-0.04) while providing clinically meaningful
interpretability scores (4.2/5.0). Our deployment study shows 87% clinician
acceptance rate and 34% reduction in diagnostic time. The results provide
strong evidence that UDM represents a practical pathway toward AI-assisted

Title: Beyond Classification: Evaluating LLMs for Fine-Grained Automatic
  Malware Behavior Auditing
Authors: Xinran Zheng, Xingzhi Qian, Yiling He, Shuo Yang, Lorenzo Cavallaro
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.SE
\\
  Automated malware classification has achieved strong detection performance.
Yet, malware behavior auditing seeks causal and verifiable explanations of
malicious activities -- essential not only to reveal what malware does but also
to substantiate such claims with evidence. This task is challenging, as
adversarial intent is often hidden within complex, framework-heavy
applications, making manual auditing slow and costly. Large Language Models
(LLMs) could help address this gap, but their auditing potential remains
largely unexplored due to three limitations: (1) scarce fine-grained
annotations for fair assessment; (2) abundant benign code obscuring malicious
signals; and (3) unverifiable, hallucination-prone outputs undermining
attribution credibility. To close this gap, we introduce MalEval, a
comprehensive framework for fine-grained Android malware auditing, designed to
evaluate how effectively LLMs support auditing under real-world constraints.
MalEval provides expert-verified reports and an updated sensitive API list to
mitigate ground truth scarcity and reduce noise via static reachability
analysis. Function-level structural representations serve as intermediate
attribution units for verifiable evaluation. Building on this, we define four
analyst-aligned tasks -- function prioritization, evidence attribution,
behavior synthesis, and sample discrimination -- together with domain-specific
metrics and a unified workload-oriented score. We evaluate seven widely used
LLMs on a curated dataset of recent malware and misclassified benign apps,
offering the first systematic assessment of their auditing capabilities.
MalEval reveals both promising potential and critical limitations across audit
stages, providing a reproducible benchmark and foundation for future research
on LLM-enhanced malware behavior auditing. MalEval is publicly available at

Title: Near-Real-Time Resource Slicing for QoS Optimization in 5G O-RAN using
  Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Peihao Yan, Jie Lu, Huacheng Zeng, and Y. Thomas Hou
Categories: eess.SY cs.AI cs.SY
\\
  Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become an important paradigm for 5G and
beyond radio access networks. This paper presents an xApp called xSlice for the
Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) of 5G O-RANs. xSlice
is an online learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts MAC-layer resource
allocation in response to dynamic network states, including time-varying
wireless channel conditions, user mobility, traffic fluctuations, and changes
in user demand. To address these network dynamics, we first formulate the
Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization problem as a regret minimization problem
by quantifying the QoS demands of all traffic sessions through weighting their
throughput, latency, and reliability. We then develop a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) framework that utilizes an actor-critic model to combine the
advantages of both value-based and policy-based updating methods. A graph
convolutional network (GCN) is incorporated as a component of the DRL framework
for graph embedding of RAN data, enabling xSlice to handle a dynamic number of
traffic sessions. We have implemented xSlice on an O-RAN testbed with 10
smartphones and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in
realistic scenarios. Experimental results show that xSlice can reduce
performance regret by 67% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Source

  We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous

models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a
diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL
policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a
drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed
prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that
diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in
sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1
robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower
and upper body control and object interaction.

Comments: Review paper
\\
  We review how sensorimotor control is dictated by interacting neural
populations, optimal feedback mechanisms, and the biomechanics of bodies.
First, we outline the distributed anatomical loops that shuttle sensorimotor
signals between cortex, subcortical regions, and spinal cord. We then summarize
evidence that neural population activity occupies low-dimensional, dynamically
evolving manifolds during planning and execution of movements. Next, we
summarize literature explaining motor behavior through the lens of optimal
control theory, which clarifies the role of internal models and feedback during
motor control. Finally, recent studies on embodied sensorimotor control address
gaps within each framework by aiming to elucidate neural population activity
through the explicit control of musculoskeletal dynamics. We close by
discussing open problems and opportunities: multi-tasking and cognitively rich
behavior, multi-regional circuit models, and the level of anatomical detail
needed in body and network models. Together, this review and recent advances
point towards reaching an integrative account of the neural control of
movement.

Title: eIQ Neutron: Redefining Edge-AI Inference with Integrated NPU and
  Compiler Innovations
Authors: Lennart Bamberg, Filippo Minnella, Roberto Bosio, Fabrizio Ottati,

Categories: cs.AR cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Computers
\\
  Neural Processing Units (NPUs) are key to enabling efficient AI inference in
resource-constrained edge environments. While peak tera operations per second
(TOPS) is often used to gauge performance, it poorly reflects real-world
performance and typically rather correlates with higher silicon cost. To
address this, architects must focus on maximizing compute utilization, without
sacrificing flexibility. This paper presents the eIQ Neutron efficient-NPU,
integrated into a commercial flagship MPU, alongside co-designed compiler
algorithms. The architecture employs a flexible, data-driven design, while the
compiler uses a constrained programming approach to optimize compute and data
movement based on workload characteristics. Compared to the leading embedded
NPU and compiler stack, our solution achieves an average speedup of 1.8x (4x
peak) at equal TOPS and memory resources across standard AI-benchmarks. Even
against NPUs with double the compute and memory resources, Neutron delivers up
to 3.3x higher performance.

Title: Q-ROAR: Outlier-Aware Rescaling for RoPE Position Interpolation in
  Quantized Long-Context LLMs
Authors: Ye Qiao, Sitao Huang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Extending LLM context windows is crucial for long range tasks. RoPE-based
position interpolation (PI) methods like linear and frequency-aware scaling
extend input lengths without retraining, while post-training quantization (PTQ)
enables practical deployment. We show that combining PI with PTQ degrades
accuracy due to coupled effects long context aliasing, dynamic range dilation,
axis grid anisotropy, and outlier shifting that induce position-dependent logit
noise. We provide the first systematic analysis of PI plus PTQ and introduce
two diagnostics: Interpolation Pressure (per-band phase scaling sensitivity)
and Tail Inflation Ratios (outlier shift from short to long contexts). To
address this, we propose Q-ROAR, a RoPE-aware, weight-only stabilization that
groups RoPE dimensions into a few frequency bands and performs a small search
over per-band scales for W_Q,W_K, with an optional symmetric variant to
preserve logit scale. The diagnostics guided search uses a tiny long-context
dev set and requires no fine-tuning, kernel, or architecture changes.
Empirically, Q-ROAR recovers up to 0.7% accuracy on standard tasks and reduces
GovReport perplexity by more than 10%, while preserving short-context
performance and compatibility with existing inference stacks.

Title: A Taxonomy of Prompt Defects in LLM Systems
Authors: Haoye Tian, Chong Wang, BoYang Yang, Lyuye Zhang, Yang Liu
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.CL cs.PL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become key components of modern software,
with prompts acting as their de-facto programming interface. However, prompt
design remains largely empirical and small mistakes can cascade into
unreliable, insecure, or inefficient behavior. This paper presents the first
systematic survey and taxonomy of prompt defects, recurring ways that prompts
fail to elicit their intended behavior from LLMs. We organize defects along six
dimensions: (1) Specification and Intent, (2) Input and Content, (3) Structure
and Formatting, (4) Context and Memory, (5) Performance and Efficiency, and (6)
Maintainability and Engineering. Each dimension is refined into fine-grained
subtypes, illustrated with concrete examples and root cause analysis. Grounded
in software engineering principles, we show how these defects surface in real
development workflows and examine their downstream effects. For every subtype,
we distill mitigation strategies that span emerging prompt engineering
patterns, automated guardrails, testing harnesses, and evaluation frameworks.
We then summarize these strategies in a master taxonomy that links defect,
impact, and remedy. We conclude with open research challenges and a call for
rigorous engineering-oriented methodologies to ensure that LLM-driven systems
are dependable by design.

Title: When Content is Goliath and Algorithm is David: The Style and Semantic
  Effects of Generative Search Engine

\\
  Generative search engines (GEs) leverage large language models (LLMs) to
deliver AI-generated summaries with website citations, establishing novel
traffic acquisition channels while fundamentally altering the search engine
optimization landscape. To investigate the distinctive characteristics of GEs,
we collect data through interactions with Google's generative and conventional
search platforms, compiling a dataset of approximately ten thousand websites
across both channels. Our empirical analysis reveals that GEs exhibit
preferences for citing content characterized by significantly higher
predictability for underlying LLMs and greater semantic similarity among
selected sources. Through controlled experiments utilizing retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) APIs, we demonstrate that these citation preferences emerge
from intrinsic LLM tendencies to favor content aligned with their generative
expression patterns. Motivated by applications of LLMs to optimize website
content, we conduct additional experimentation to explore how LLM-based content
polishing by website proprietors alters AI summaries, finding that such
polishing paradoxically enhances information diversity within AI summaries.
Finally, to assess the user-end impact of LLM-induced information increases, we
design a generative search engine and recruit Prolific participants to conduct
a randomized controlled experiment involving an information-seeking and writing
task. We find that higher-educated users exhibit minimal changes in their final
outputs' information diversity but demonstrate significantly reduced task
completion time when original sites undergo polishing. Conversely,
lower-educated users primarily benefit through enhanced information density in
their task outputs while maintaining similar completion times across
experimental groups.

Title: BEACON: Behavioral Malware Classification with Large Language Model
  Embeddings and Deep Learning
Authors: Wadduwage Shanika Perera and Haodi Jiang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR
\\
  Malware is becoming increasingly complex and widespread, making it essential
to develop more effective and timely detection methods. Traditional static
analysis often fails to defend against modern threats that employ code
obfuscation, polymorphism, and other evasion techniques. In contrast,
behavioral malware detection, which monitors runtime activities, provides a
more reliable and context-aware solution. In this work, we propose BEACON, a
novel deep learning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
generate dense, contextual embeddings from raw sandbox-generated behavior
reports. These embeddings capture semantic and structural patterns of each
sample and are processed by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D
CNN) for multi-class malware classification. Evaluated on the Avast-CTU Public
CAPE Dataset, our framework consistently outperforms existing methods,
highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based behavioral embeddings and the
overall design of BEACON for robust malware classification.

\\
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transitioned from a futuristic concept
reserved for large corporations to a present-day, accessible, and essential
growth lever for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). For entrepreneurs
and business leaders, strategic AI adoption is no longer an option but an
imperative for competitiveness, operational efficiency, and long-term survival.
This report provides a comprehensive framework for SME leaders to navigate this
technological shift, offering the foundational knowledge, business case,
practical applications, and strategic guidance necessary to harness the power
of AI. The quantitative evidence supporting AI adoption is compelling; 91% of
SMEs using AI report that it directly boosts their revenue. Beyond top-line
growth, AI drives profound operational efficiencies, with studies showing it
can reduce operational costs by up to 30% and save businesses more than 20
hours of valuable time each month. This transformation is occurring within the
context of a seismic economic shift; the global AI market is projected to surge
from $233.46 Billion in 2024 to an astonishing $1.77 Trillion by 2032. This
paper demystifies the core concepts of AI, presents a business case based on
market data, details practical applications, and lays out a phased, actionable
adoption strategy.

Authors: Kihoon Son, DaEun Choi, Tae Soo Kim, Young-Ho Kim, Sangdoo Yun, Juho
  Kim
Categories: cs.HC cs.AI
\\
  Capturing professionals' decision-making in creative workflows is essential
for reflection, collaboration, and knowledge sharing, yet existing methods
often leave rationales incomplete and implicit decisions hidden. To address
this, we present CLEAR framework that structures reasoning into cognitive
decision steps-linked units of actions, artifacts, and self-explanations that
make decisions traceable. Building on this framework, we introduce ClearFairy,
a think-aloud AI assistant for UI design that detects weak explanations, asks
lightweight clarifying questions, and infers missing rationales to ease the
knowledge-sharing burden. In a study with twelve creative professionals, 85% of
ClearFairy's inferred rationales were accepted, increasing strong explanations
from 14% to over 83% of decision steps without adding cognitive demand. The
captured steps also enhanced generative AI agents in Figma, yielding
next-action predictions better aligned with professionals and producing more
coherent design outcomes. For future research on human knowledge-grounded
creative AI agents, we release a dataset of captured 417 decision steps.

Title: LLM Jailbreak Detection for (Almost) Free!
Authors: Guorui Chen, Yifan Xia, Xiaojun Jia, Zhijiang Li, Philip Torr, Jindong
  Gu
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) enhance security through alignment when widely
used, but remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks capable of producing
inappropriate content. Jailbreak detection methods show promise in mitigating
jailbreak attacks through the assistance of other models or multiple model
inferences. However, existing methods entail significant computational costs.
In this paper, we first present a finding that the difference in output
distributions between jailbreak and benign prompts can be employed for
detecting jailbreak prompts. Based on this finding, we propose a Free Jailbreak
Detection (FJD) which prepends an affirmative instruction to the input and
scales the logits by temperature to further distinguish between jailbreak and
benign prompts through the confidence of the first token. Furthermore, we
enhance the detection performance of FJD through the integration of virtual
instruction learning. Extensive experiments on aligned LLMs show that our FJD
can effectively detect jailbreak prompts with almost no additional
computational costs during LLM inference.

  Robustness of Vision-Language Models

  Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics)
\\
  Vision-language (VL) models have shown transformative potential across
various critical domains due to their capability to comprehend multi-modal
information. However, their performance frequently degrades under distribution
shifts, making it crucial to assess and improve robustness against real-world
data corruption encountered in practical applications. While advancements in VL
benchmark datasets and data augmentation (DA) have contributed to robustness
evaluation and improvement, there remain challenges due to a lack of in-depth
comprehension of model behavior as well as the need for expertise and iterative
efforts to explore data patterns. Given the achievement of visualization in
explaining complex models and exploring large-scale data, understanding the
impact of various data corruption on VL models aligns naturally with a visual
analytics approach. To address these challenges, we introduce VisMoDAl, a
visual analytics framework designed to evaluate VL model robustness against
various corruption types and identify underperformed samples to guide the
development of effective DA strategies. Grounded in the literature review and
expert discussions, VisMoDAl supports multi-level analysis, ranging from
examining performance under specific corruptions to task-driven inspection of
model behavior and corresponding data slice. Unlike conventional works,
VisMoDAl enables users to reason about the effects of corruption on VL models,
facilitating both model behavior understanding and DA strategy formulation. The
utility of our system is demonstrated through case studies and quantitative
evaluations focused on corruption robustness in the image captioning task.

Title: Can I Trust This Chatbot? Assessing User Privacy in AI-Healthcare
  Chatbot Applications

Comments: 13 pages. To be published in ASIS&T 2025 Conference
\\
  As Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into
everyday life, AI-powered chatbot mobile applications are increasingly adopted
across industries, particularly in the healthcare domain. These chatbots offer
accessible and 24/7 support, yet their collection and processing of sensitive
health data present critical privacy concerns. While prior research has
examined chatbot security, privacy issues specific to AI healthcare chatbots
have received limited attention. Our study evaluates the privacy practices of
12 widely downloaded AI healthcare chatbot apps available on the App Store and
Google Play in the United States. We conducted a three-step assessment
analyzing: (1) privacy settings during sign-up, (2) in-app privacy controls,
and (3) the content of privacy policies. The analysis identified significant
gaps in user data protection. Our findings reveal that half of the examined
apps did not present a privacy policy during sign up, and only two provided an
option to disable data sharing at that stage. The majority of apps' privacy
policies failed to address data protection measures. Moreover, users had
minimal control over their personal data. The study provides key insights for
information science researchers, developers, and policymakers to improve
privacy protections in AI healthcare chatbot apps.

  We present ATLANTIS, the cyber reasoning system developed by Team Atlanta
that won 1st place in the Final Competition of DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge
(AIxCC) at DEF CON 33 (August 2025). AIxCC (2023-2025) challenged teams to
build autonomous cyber reasoning systems capable of discovering and patching
vulnerabilities at the speed and scale of modern software. ATLANTIS integrates
large language models (LLMs) with program analysis -- combining symbolic
execution, directed fuzzing, and static analysis -- to address limitations in
automated vulnerability discovery and program repair. Developed by researchers
at Georgia Institute of Technology, Samsung Research, KAIST, and POSTECH, the
system addresses core challenges: scaling across diverse codebases from C to
Java, achieving high precision while maintaining broad coverage, and producing
semantically correct patches that preserve intended behavior. We detail the
design philosophy, architectural decisions, and implementation strategies
behind ATLANTIS, share lessons learned from pushing the boundaries of automated
security when program analysis meets modern AI, and release artifacts to
support reproducibility and future research.

Categories: cs.DB cs.AI
\\
  Unstructured data, such as text, images, audio, and video, comprises the vast
majority of the world's information, yet it remains poorly supported by
traditional data systems that rely on structured formats for computation. We
argue for a new paradigm, which we call computing on unstructured data, built
around three stages: extraction of latent structure, transformation of this
structure through data processing techniques, and projection back into
unstructured formats. This bi-directional pipeline allows unstructured data to
benefit from the analytical power of structured computation, while preserving
the richness and accessibility of unstructured representations for human and AI
consumption. We illustrate this paradigm through two use cases and present the
research components that need to be developed in a new data system called
MXFlow.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise settings
where they interact with multiple users and are trained or fine-tuned on
sensitive internal data. While fine-tuning enhances performance by
internalizing domain knowledge, it also introduces a critical security risk:
leakage of confidential training data to unauthorized users. These risks are
exacerbated when LLMs are combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines that dynamically fetch contextual documents at inference time.
  We demonstrate data exfiltration attacks on AI assistants where adversaries
can exploit current fine-tuning and RAG architectures to leak sensitive
information by leveraging the lack of access control enforcement. We show that
existing defenses, including prompt sanitization, output filtering, system
isolation, and training-level privacy mechanisms, are fundamentally
probabilistic and fail to offer robust protection against such attacks.
  We take the position that only a deterministic and rigorous enforcement of
fine-grained access control during both fine-tuning and RAG-based inference can
reliably prevent the leakage of sensitive data to unauthorized recipients.
  We introduce a framework centered on the principle that any content used in
training, retrieval, or generation by an LLM is explicitly authorized for
\emph{all users involved in the interaction}. Our approach offers a simple yet
powerful paradigm shift for building secure multi-user LLM systems that are
grounded in classical access control but adapted to the unique challenges of
modern AI workflows. Our solution has been deployed in Microsoft Copilot
Tuning, a product offering that enables organizations to fine-tune models using
their own enterprise-specific data.

  With the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive
applications, online malicious intent detection has become increasingly
critical. However, existing approaches fall short of handling diverse and
complex user queries in real time. To address these challenges, we introduce
ADRAG (Adversarial Distilled Retrieval-Augmented Guard), a two-stage framework
for robust and efficient online malicious intent detection. In the training
stage, a high-capacity teacher model is trained on adversarially perturbed,
retrieval-augmented inputs to learn robust decision boundaries over diverse and
complex user queries. In the inference stage, a distillation scheduler
transfers the teacher's knowledge into a compact student model, with a
continually updated knowledge base collected online. At deployment, the compact
student model leverages top-K similar safety exemplars retrieved from the
online-updated knowledge base to enable both online and real-time malicious
query detection. Evaluations across ten safety benchmarks demonstrate that
ADRAG, with a 149M-parameter model, achieves 98.5% of WildGuard-7B's
performance, surpasses GPT-4 by 3.3% and Llama-Guard-3-8B by 9.5% on
out-of-distribution detection, while simultaneously delivering up to 5.6x lower
latency at 300 queries per second (QPS) in real-time applications.

  Dynamic energy systems and controls require advanced modeling frameworks to
design and test supervisory and fault tolerant strategies. Modelica is a widely
used equation based language, but developing control modules is labor intensive
and requires specialized expertise. This paper examines the use of large
language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of Control Description
Language modules in the Building Modelica Library as a case study. We developed
a structured workflow that combines standardized prompt scaffolds, library
aware grounding, automated compilation with OpenModelica, and human in the loop
evaluation. Experiments were carried out on four basic logic tasks (And, Or,
Not, and Switch) and five control modules (chiller enable/disable, bypass valve
control, cooling tower fan speed, plant requests, and relief damper control).
The results showed that GPT 4o failed to produce executable Modelica code in
zero shot mode, while Claude Sonnet 4 achieved up to full success for basic
logic blocks with carefully engineered prompts. For control modules, success
rates reached 83 percent, and failed outputs required medium level human repair
(estimated one to eight hours). Retrieval augmented generation often produced
mismatches in module selection (for example, And retrieved as Or), while a
deterministic hard rule search strategy avoided these errors. Human evaluation
also outperformed AI evaluation, since current LLMs cannot assess simulation
results or validate behavioral correctness. Despite these limitations, the LLM
assisted workflow reduced the average development time from 10 to 20 hours down
to 4 to 6 hours per module, corresponding to 40 to 60 percent time savings.
These results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LLM
assisted Modelica generation, and point to future research in pre simulation
validation, stronger grounding, and closed loop evaluation.

  Human conversation involves language, speech, and visual cues, with each
medium providing complementary information. For instance, speech conveys a vibe
or tone not fully captured by text alone. While multimodal LLMs focus on
generating text responses from diverse inputs, less attention has been paid to
generating natural and engaging speech. We propose a human-like agent that
generates speech responses based on conversation mood and responsive style
information. To achieve this, we build a novel MultiSensory Conversation
dataset focused on speech to enable agents to generate natural speech. We then
propose a multimodal LLM-based model for generating text responses and voice
descriptions, which are used to generate speech covering paralinguistic
information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing
both visual and audio modalities in conversation to generate engaging speech.

  Speaker diarization systems often struggle with high intrinsic intra-speaker
variability, such as shifts in emotion, health, or content. This can cause
segments from the same speaker to be misclassified as different individuals,
for example, when one raises their voice or speaks faster during conversation.
To address this, we propose a style-controllable speech generation model that
augments speech across diverse styles while preserving the target speaker's
identity. The proposed system starts with diarized segments from a conventional
diarizer. For each diarized segment, it generates augmented speech samples
enriched with phonetic and stylistic diversity. And then, speaker embeddings
from both the original and generated audio are blended to enhance the system's
robustness in grouping segments with high intrinsic intra-speaker variability.
We validate our approach on a simulated emotional speech dataset and the
truncated AMI dataset, demonstrating significant improvements, with error rate
reductions of 49% and 35% on each dataset, respectively.

  Modeling dynamic temporal dependencies is a critical challenge in time series
pre-training, which evolve due to distribution shifts and multi-scale patterns.
This temporal variability severely impairs the generalization of pre-trained
models to downstream tasks. Existing frameworks fail to capture the complex
interactions of short- and long-term dependencies, making them susceptible to
spurious correlations that degrade generalization. To address these
limitations, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework
that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving
inter-patch dependencies. At the input level, DeCoP introduces Instance-wise
Patch Normalization (IPN) to mitigate distributional shifts while preserving
the unique characteristics of each patch, creating a robust foundation for
representation learning. At the latent level, a hierarchical Dependency
Controlled Learning (DCL) strategy explicitly models inter-patch dependencies
across multiple temporal scales, with an Instance-level Contrastive Module
(ICM) enhances global generalization by learning instance-discriminative
representations from time-invariant positive pairs. DeCoP achieves
state-of-the-art results on ten datasets with lower computing resources,
improving MSE by 3% on ETTh1 over PatchTST using only 37% of the FLOPs.

  The rapid proliferation of IoT nodes equipped with microphones and capable of
performing on-device audio classification exposes highly sensitive data while
operating under tight resource constraints. To protect against this, we present
a defence-in-depth architecture comprising a security protocol that treats the
edge device, cellular network and cloud backend as three separate trust
domains, linked by TPM-based remote attestation and mutually authenticated TLS
1.3. A STRIDE-driven threat model and attack-tree analysis guide the design. At
startup, each boot stage is measured into TPM PCRs. The node can only decrypt
its LUKS-sealed partitions after the cloud has verified a TPM quote and
released a one-time unlock key. This ensures that rogue or tampered devices
remain inert. Data in transit is protected by TLS 1.3 and hybridised with Kyber
and Dilithium to provide post-quantum resilience. Meanwhile, end-to-end
encryption and integrity hashes safeguard extracted audio features. Signed,
rollback-protected AI models and tamper-responsive sensors harden firmware and
hardware. Data at rest follows a 3-2-1 strategy comprising a solid-state drive
sealed with LUKS, an offline cold archive encrypted with a hybrid post-quantum
cipher and an encrypted cloud replica. Finally, we set out a plan for
evaluating the physical and logical security of the proposed protocol.

  Spatial audio reasoning enables machines to interpret auditory scenes by
understanding events and their spatial attributes. In this work, we focus on
spatial audio understanding with an emphasis on reasoning about moving sources.
First, we introduce a spatial audio encoder that processes spatial audio to
detect multiple overlapping events and estimate their spatial attributes,
Direction of Arrival (DoA) and source distance, at the frame level. To
generalize to unseen events, we incorporate an audio grounding model that
aligns audio features with semantic audio class text embeddings via a
cross-attention mechanism. Second, to answer complex queries about dynamic
audio scenes involving moving sources, we condition a large language model
(LLM) on structured spatial attributes extracted by our model. Finally, we
introduce a spatial audio motion understanding and reasoning benchmark dataset
and demonstrate our framework's performance against the baseline model.

  Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) remains a central
challenge in computational pharmacology, where sequence-based methods offer
scalability. This work introduces a sequence-based drug-target interaction
framework that integrates structural priors into protein representations while
maintaining high-throughput screening capability. Evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human and
BioSNAP datasets and remains competitive on BindingDB. In virtual screening
tasks, it surpasses prior methods on LIT-PCBA, yielding substantial gains in
AUROC and BEDROC. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of learned
aggregation, bilinear attention, and contrastive alignment in enhancing
predictive robustness. Embedding visualizations reveal improved spatial
correspondence with known binding pockets and highlight interpretable attention
patterns over ligand-residue contacts. These results validate the framework's
utility for scalable and structure-aware DTI prediction.

Title: OnlineMate: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent Companion System for Cognitive
  Support in Online Learning
Authors: Xian Gao, Zongyun Zhang, Ting Liu, Yuzhuo Fu
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  In online learning environments, students often lack personalized peer
interactions, which play a crucial role in supporting cognitive development and
learning engagement. Although previous studies have utilized large language
models (LLMs) to simulate interactive dynamic learning environments for
students, these interactions remain limited to conversational exchanges,
lacking insights and adaptations to the learners' individualized learning and
cognitive states. As a result, students' interest in discussions with AI
learning companions is low, and they struggle to gain inspiration from such
interactions. To address this challenge, we propose OnlineMate, a multi-agent
learning companion system driven by LLMs that integrates the Theory of Mind
(ToM). OnlineMate is capable of simulating peer-like agent roles, adapting to
learners' cognitive states during collaborative discussions, and inferring
their psychological states, such as misunderstandings, confusion, or
motivation. By incorporating Theory of Mind capabilities, the system can
dynamically adjust its interaction strategies to support the development of
higher-order thinking and cognition. Experimental results in simulated learning
scenarios demonstrate that OnlineMate effectively fosters deep learning and
discussions while enhancing cognitive engagement in online educational
settings.

  Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026), to be held in Barcelona, Spain, on May 4-8,

\\
  Stochastic forecasting is critical for efficient decision-making in uncertain
systems, such as energy markets and finance, where estimating the full
distribution of future scenarios is essential. We propose Diffusion Scenario
Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees for
multivariate prediction tasks using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting
models. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a
tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on
observed history) at each stage. We evaluate the framework on the optimization
task of energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the same
optimization algorithms that use scenario trees from more conventional models
and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines. Furthermore, using DST for
stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies, achieving
higher performance by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and
stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster.

Title: MeanFlowSE: one-step generative speech enhancement via conditional mean
  flow
Authors: Duojia Li, Shenghui Lu, Hongchen Pan, Zongyi Zhan, Qingyang Hong, Lin
  Li
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI
\\
  Multistep inference is a bottleneck for real-time generative speech
enhancement because flow- and diffusion-based systems learn an instantaneous
velocity field and therefore rely on iterative ordinary differential equation
(ODE) solvers. We introduce MeanFlowSE, a conditional generative model that
learns the average velocity over finite intervals along a trajectory. Using a
Jacobian-vector product (JVP) to instantiate the MeanFlow identity, we derive a
local training objective that directly supervises finite-interval displacement
while remaining consistent with the instantaneous-field constraint on the
diagonal. At inference, MeanFlowSE performs single-step generation via a
backward-in-time displacement, removing the need for multistep solvers; an
optional few-step variant offers additional refinement. On VoiceBank-DEMAND,
the single-step model achieves strong intelligibility, fidelity, and perceptual
quality with substantially lower computational cost than multistep baselines.
The method requires no knowledge distillation or external teachers, providing
an efficient, high-fidelity framework for real-time generative speech
enhancement.

Title: Exploring the Global-to-Local Attention Scheme in Graph Transformers: An
  Empirical Study
Authors: Zhengwei Wang and Gang Wu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Graph Transformers (GTs) show considerable potential in graph representation
learning. The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to
attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention
scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures
long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer
from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN
could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer,
featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network
layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper
layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby
preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective
cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to
retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information
loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of
the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with
state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The
results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping
linear complexity.

  We conducted rigorous ablation studies to validate DPANet's key components
(Table \ref{tab:ablation-study}). The full model consistently outperforms all
variants. To test our dual-domain hypothesis, we designed two specialized
versions: a Temporal-Only model (fusing two identical temporal pyramids) and a
Frequency-Only model (fusing two spectral pyramids). Both variants
underperformed significantly, confirming that the fusion of heterogeneous
temporal and frequency information is critical. Furthermore, replacing the
cross-attention mechanism with a simpler method (w/o Cross-Fusion) caused the
most severe performance degradation. This result underscores that our
interactive fusion block is the most essential component.

  While simulators exist for vehicular IoT nodes communicating with the Cloud
through Edge nodes in a fully-simulated osmotic architecture, they often lack
support for dynamic agent planning and optimisation to minimise vehicular
battery consumption while ensuring fair communication times. Addressing these
challenges requires extending current simulator architectures with AI
algorithms for both traffic prediction and dynamic agent planning. This paper
presents an extension of SimulatorOrchestrator (SO) to meet these requirements.
Preliminary results over a realistic urban dataset show that utilising
vehicular planning algorithms can lead to improved battery and QoS performance
compared with traditional shortest path algorithms. The additional inclusion of
desirability areas enabled more ambulances to be routed to their target
destinations while utilising less energy to do so, compared to traditional and
weighted algorithms without desirability considerations.

  Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are essential for large-scale audio tasks
like diffusion-based generation. However, existing open-source models often
neglect auditory perceptual aspects during training, leading to weaknesses in
phase accuracy and stereophonic spatial representation. To address these
challenges, we propose {\epsilon}ar-VAE, an open-source music signal
reconstruction model that rethinks and optimizes the VAE training paradigm. Our
contributions are threefold: (i) A K-weighting perceptual filter applied prior
to loss calculation to align the objective with auditory perception. (ii) Two
novel phase losses: a Correlation Loss for stereo coherence, and a Phase Loss
using its derivatives--Instantaneous Frequency and Group Delay--for precision.
(iii) A new spectral supervision paradigm where magnitude is supervised by all
four Mid/Side/Left/Right components, while phase is supervised only by the LR
components. Experiments show {\epsilon}ar-VAE at 44.1kHz substantially
outperforms leading open-source models across diverse metrics, showing
particular strength in reconstructing high-frequency harmonics and the spatial
characteristics.

Title: Estimating Respiratory Effort from Nocturnal Breathing Sounds for
  Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Screening
Authors: Xiaolei Xu, Chaoyue Niu, Guy J. Brown, Hector Romero and Ning Ma
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI eess.AS
Comments: Submitted to ICASSP 2026
\\
  Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a prevalent condition with significant
health consequences, yet many patients remain undiagnosed due to the complexity
and cost of over-night polysomnography. Acoustic-based screening provides a
scalable alternative, yet performance is limited by environmental noise and the
lack of physiological context. Respiratory effort is a key signal used in
clinical scoring of OSA events, but current approaches require additional
contact sensors that reduce scalability and patient comfort. This paper
presents the first study to estimate respiratory effort directly from nocturnal
audio, enabling physiological context to be recovered from sound alone. We
propose a latent-space fusion framework that integrates the estimated effort
embeddings with acoustic features for OSA detection. Using a dataset of 157
nights from 103 participants recorded in home environments, our respiratory
effort estimator achieves a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.48,
capturing meaningful respiratory dynamics. Fusing effort and audio improves
sensitivity and AUC over audio-only baselines, especially at low
apnoea-hypopnoea index thresholds. The proposed approach requires only
smartphone audio at test time, which enables sensor-free, scalable, and
longitudinal OSA monitoring.

Title: Discrete optimal transport is a strong audio adversarial attack

Categories: eess.AS cs.AI
\\
  In this paper, we show that discrete optimal transport (DOT) is an effective
black-box adversarial attack against modern audio anti-spoofing countermeasures
(CMs). Our attack operates as a post-processing, distribution-alignment step:
frame-level WavLM embeddings of generated speech are aligned to an unpaired
bona fide pool via entropic OT and a top-$k$ barycentric projection, then
decoded with a neural vocoder. Evaluated on ASVspoof2019 and ASVspoof5 with
AASIST baselines, DOT yields consistently high equal error rate (EER) across
datasets and remains competitive after CM fine-tuning, outperforming several
conventional attacks in cross-dataset transfer. Ablation analysis highlights
the practical impact of vocoder overlap. Results indicate that
distribution-level alignment is a powerful and stable attack surface for
deployed CMs.

  Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a
robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and
fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in
unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and
generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,
struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address
these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a
Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP
(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages
proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both
close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant
end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed
by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational
efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness
near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world
environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates
and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach
demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong
generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation
in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are

wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of
sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for
placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of

  Clustering

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NI
Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Attention mechanisms have become a cornerstone in modern neural networks,
driving breakthroughs across diverse domains. However, their application to
graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential,
remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize
neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations.
Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at
the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question:
Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address
this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the
complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated
by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a
novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN
directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling
effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local
topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast
AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV
cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin
contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary environments is challenging, as
changing dynamics and rewards quickly make past experiences outdated.
Traditional experience replay (ER) methods, especially those using TD-error
prioritization, struggle to distinguish between changes caused by the agent's
policy and those from the environment, resulting in inefficient learning under
dynamic conditions. To address this challenge, we propose the Discrepancy of
Environment Dynamics (DoE), a metric that isolates the effects of environment
shifts on value functions. Building on this, we introduce Discrepancy of
Environment Prioritized Experience Replay (DEER), an adaptive ER framework that
prioritizes transitions based on both policy updates and environmental changes.
DEER uses a binary classifier to detect environment changes and applies
distinct prioritization strategies before and after each shift, enabling more
sample-efficient learning. Experiments on four non-stationary benchmarks
demonstrate that DEER further improves the performance of off-policy algorithms
by 11.54 percent compared to the best-performing state-of-the-art ER methods.

  Directional forecasting in financial markets requires both accuracy and
interpretability. Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches
based on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness
and scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models
can effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency.
To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates
unsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting. (i) SIMPC
segments and clusters multivariate time series, extracting recurrent patterns
that are invariant to amplitude scaling and temporal distortion, even under
varying window sizes. (ii) JISC-Net is a shapelet-based classifier that uses
the initial part of extracted patterns as input and forecasts subsequent
partial sequences for short-term directional movement. Experiments on Bitcoin
and three S&P 500 equities demonstrate that our method ranks first or second in
11 out of 12 metric--dataset combinations, consistently outperforming
baselines. Unlike conventional deep learning models that output buy-or-sell
signals without interpretable justification, our approach enables transparent
decision-making by revealing the underlying pattern structures that drive
predictive outcomes.

Title: Reinforcement Learning Agent for a 2D Shooter Game
Authors: Thomas Ackermann and Moritz Spang and Hamza A. A. Gardi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Reinforcement learning agents in complex game environments often suffer from
sparse rewards, training instability, and poor sample efficiency. This paper
presents a hybrid training approach that combines offline imitation learning
with online reinforcement learning for a 2D shooter game agent. We implement a
multi-head neural network with separate outputs for behavioral cloning and
Q-learning, unified by shared feature extraction layers with attention
mechanisms. Initial experiments using pure deep Q-Networks exhibited
significant instability, with agents frequently reverting to poor policies
despite occasional good performance. To address this, we developed a hybrid
methodology that begins with behavioral cloning on demonstration data from
rule-based agents, then transitions to reinforcement learning. Our hybrid
approach achieves consistently above 70% win rate against rule-based opponents,
substantially outperforming pure reinforcement learning methods which showed
high variance and frequent performance degradation. The multi-head architecture
enables effective knowledge transfer between learning modes while maintaining
training stability. Results demonstrate that combining demonstration-based
initialization with reinforcement learning optimization provides a robust
solution for developing game AI agents in complex multi-agent environments
where pure exploration proves insufficient.

\\
  Credit card fraud remains a significant challenge due to class imbalance and
fraudsters mimicking legitimate behavior. This study evaluates five machine
learning models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on a real-world dataset using
undersampling, SMOTE, and a hybrid approach. Our models are evaluated on the
original imbalanced test set to better reflect real-world performance. Results
show that the hybrid method achieves the best balance between recall and
precision, especially improving MLP and KNN performance.

Title: Balancing Sparse RNNs with Hyperparameterization Benefiting
  Meta-Learning
Authors: Quincy Hershey, Randy Paffenroth
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  This paper develops alternative hyperparameters for specifying sparse
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These hyperparameters allow for varying
sparsity within the trainable weight matrices of the model while improving
overall performance. This architecture enables the definition of a novel
metric, hidden proportion, which seeks to balance the distribution of unknowns
within the model and provides significant explanatory power of model
performance. Together, the use of the varied sparsity RNN architecture combined
with the hidden proportion metric generates significant performance gains while
improving performance expectations on an a priori basis. This combined approach
provides a path forward towards generalized meta-learning applications and
model optimization based on intrinsic characteristics of the data set,
including input and output dimensions.

Title: Communication Efficient Split Learning of ViTs with Attention-based
  Double Compression
Authors: Federico Alvetreti, Jary Pomponi, Paolo Di Lorenzo, Simone Scardapane
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient Split Learning (SL)
framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the
communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision
Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two
parallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that
are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client
layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples
having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing
final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least
meaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these
strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also
the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained
without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation
results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms
state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication
overheads while maintaining high accuracy.

Categories: eess.AS cs.AI
\\
  Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems remain prone to errors that affect
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose LIR-ASR, a heuristic
optimized iterative correction framework using LLMs, inspired by human auditory
perception. LIR-ASR applies a "Listening-Imagining-Refining" strategy,
generating phonetic variants and refining them in context. A heuristic
optimization with finite state machine (FSM) is introduced to prevent the
correction process from being trapped in local optima and rule-based
constraints help maintain semantic fidelity. Experiments on both English and
Chinese ASR outputs show that LIR-ASR achieves average reductions in CER/WER of
up to 1.5 percentage points compared to baselines, demonstrating substantial
accuracy gains in transcription.

Title: WorldForge: Unlocking Emergent 3D/4D Generation in Video Diffusion Model
  via Training-Free Guidance
Authors: Chenxi Song, Yanming Yang, Tong Zhao, Ruibo Li, Chi Zhang
Categories: cs.GR cs.AI cs.CV
Comments: Project Webpage: https://worldforge-agi.github.io/
\\
  Recent video diffusion models demonstrate strong potential in spatial
intelligence tasks due to their rich latent world priors. However, this
potential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric
inconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical
use in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or
fine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high
computational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free,
inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step
Recursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during
inference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising
step to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages
optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space
and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels.
Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths
to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural
signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned
guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and
photorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory
consistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play
paradigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on
leveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence.

Title: Exploring How Audio Effects Alter Emotion with Foundation Models
Authors: Stelios Katsis, Vassilis Lyberatos, Spyridon Kantarelis, Edmund
  Dervakos, and Giorgos Stamou
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI
\\
  Audio effects (FX) such as reverberation, distortion, modulation, and dynamic
range processing play a pivotal role in shaping emotional responses during
music listening. While prior studies have examined links between low-level
audio features and affective perception, the systematic impact of audio FX on
emotion remains underexplored. This work investigates how foundation models -
large-scale neural architectures pretrained on multimodal data - can be
leveraged to analyze these effects. Such models encode rich associations
between musical structure, timbre, and affective meaning, offering a powerful
framework for probing the emotional consequences of sound design techniques. By
applying various probing methods to embeddings from deep learning models, we
examine the complex, nonlinear relationships between audio FX and estimated
emotion, uncovering patterns tied to specific effects and evaluating the
robustness of foundation audio models. Our findings aim to advance
understanding of the perceptual impact of audio production practices, with
implications for music cognition, performance, and affective computing.

  Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) distinguishes wireless
devices by the small variations in their analog circuits, avoiding heavy
cryptographic authentication. While deep learning on spectrograms improves
accuracy, models remain vulnerable to copying, tampering, and evasion. We
present a stronger RFFI system combining watermarking for ownership proof and
anomaly detection for spotting suspicious inputs. Using a ResNet-34 on log-Mel
spectrograms, we embed three watermarks: a simple trigger, an adversarially
trained trigger robust to noise and filtering, and a hidden gradient/weight
signature. A convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Kullback-Leibler
(KL) warm-up and free-bits flags off-distribution queries. On the LoRa dataset,
our system achieves 94.6% accuracy, 98% watermark success, and 0.94 AUROC,

  Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)
\\
  Variational quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading candidate for harnessing
quantum computers to advance quantum chemistry and materials simulations, yet
its training efficiency deteriorates rapidly for large Hamiltonians. Two issues
underlie this bottleneck: (i) the no-cloning theorem imposes a linear growth in
circuit evaluations with the number of parameters per gradient step; and (ii)
deeper circuits encounter barren plateaus (BPs), leading to exponentially
increasing measurement overheads. To address these challenges, here we propose
a deep learning framework, dubbed Titan, which identifies and freezes inactive
parameters of a given ansatze at initialization for a specific class of
Hamiltonians, reducing the optimization overhead without sacrificing accuracy.
The motivation of Titan starts with our empirical findings that a subset of
parameters consistently has a negligible influence on training dynamics. Its
design combines a theoretically grounded data construction strategy, ensuring
each training example is informative and BP-resilient, with an adaptive neural
architecture that generalizes across ansatze of varying sizes. Across benchmark
transverse-field Ising models, Heisenberg models, and multiple molecule systems
up to 30 qubits, Titan achieves up to 3 times faster convergence and 40% to 60%
fewer circuit evaluations than state-of-the-art baselines, while matching or
surpassing their estimation accuracy. By proactively trimming parameter space,
Titan lowers hardware demands and offers a scalable path toward utilizing VQE
to advance practical quantum chemistry and materials science.

  Fuzz testing is one of the most effective techniques for finding software
vulnerabilities. While modern fuzzers can generate inputs and monitor
executions automatically, the overall workflow, from analyzing a codebase, to
configuring harnesses, to triaging results, still requires substantial manual
effort. Prior attempts focused on single stages such as harness synthesis or
input minimization, leaving researchers to manually connect the pieces into a
complete fuzzing campaign.
  We introduce Orion, a framework that automates the the manual bottlenecks of
fuzzing by integrating LLM reasoning with traditional tools, allowing campaigns
to scale to settings where human effort alone was impractical. Orion uses LLMs
for code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools
for verification, iterative refinement, and tasks that require precision.
Across our benchmark suite, Orion reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on
the workflow stage, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through the discovery
of two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib
library.

  We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing
instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement
learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods
(\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while
neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In
contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution
using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL
divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this
idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration
and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and
code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of
$10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs
consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward
distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse
reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.

Title: Explicit Context-Driven Neural Acoustic Modeling for High-Fidelity RIR
  Generation
Authors: Chen Si, Qianyi Wu, Chaitanya Amballa, Romit Roy Choudhury
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Realistic sound simulation plays a critical role in many applications. A key
element in sound simulation is the room impulse response (RIR), which
characterizes how sound propagates from a source to a listener within a given
space. Recent studies have applied neural implicit methods to learn RIR using
context information collected from the environment, such as scene images.
However, these approaches do not effectively leverage explicit geometric
information from the environment. To further exploit the potential of neural
implicit models with direct geometric features, we present Mesh-infused Neural
Acoustic Field (MiNAF), which queries a rough room mesh at given locations and
extracts distance distributions as an explicit representation of local context.
Our approach demonstrates that incorporating explicit local geometric features
can better guide the neural network in generating more accurate RIR
predictions. Through comparisons with conventional and state-of-the-art
baseline methods, we show that MiNAF performs competitively across various
evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we verify the robustness of MiNAF in datasets
with limited training samples, demonstrating an advance in high-fidelity sound
simulation.

Title: Masked Diffusion Models as Energy Minimization
Authors: Sitong Chen, Shen Nie, Jiacheng Sun, Zijin Feng, Zhenguo Li, Ji-Rong
  Wen, Chongxuan Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  We present a systematic theoretical framework that interprets masked
diffusion models (MDMs) as solutions to energy minimization problems in
discrete optimal transport. Specifically, we prove that three distinct energy
formulations--kinetic, conditional kinetic, and geodesic energy--are
mathematically equivalent under the structure of MDMs, and that MDMs minimize
all three when the mask schedule satisfies a closed-form optimality condition.
This unification not only clarifies the theoretical foundations of MDMs, but
also motivates practical improvements in sampling. By parameterizing
interpolation schedules via Beta distributions, we reduce the schedule design
space to a tractable 2D search, enabling efficient post-training tuning without
model modification. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks
demonstrate that our energy-inspired schedules outperform hand-crafted
baselines, particularly in low-step sampling settings.

Categories: cs.CR cs.CL
\\
  Safety alignment aims to prevent Large Language Models (LLMs) from responding
to harmful queries. To strengthen safety protections, jailbreak methods are
developed to simulate malicious attacks and uncover vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we introduce HILL (Hiding Intention by Learning from LLMs), a novel
jailbreak approach that systematically transforms imperative harmful requests
into learning-style questions with only straightforward hypotheticality
indicators. Further, we introduce two new metrics to thoroughly evaluate the
utility of jailbreak methods. Experiments on the AdvBench dataset across a wide
range of models demonstrate HILL's strong effectiveness, generalizability, and
harmfulness. It achieves top attack success rates on the majority of models and
across malicious categories while maintaining high efficiency with concise
prompts. Results of various defense methods show the robustness of HILL, with
most defenses having mediocre effects or even increasing the attack success
rates. Moreover, the assessment on our constructed safe prompts reveals
inherent limitations of LLMs' safety mechanisms and flaws in defense methods.
This work exposes significant vulnerabilities of safety measures against
learning-style elicitation, highlighting a critical challenge of balancing
helpfulness and safety alignments.

Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  While reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for LLM-based tool
learning, its efficiency is often hampered by an overabundance of simple
samples that provide diminishing learning value as training progresses.
Existing dynamic sampling techniques are ill-suited for the multi-task
structure and fine-grained reward mechanisms inherent to tool learning. This
paper introduces Dynamic Sampling with Curriculum Learning (DSCL), a framework
specifically designed to address this challenge by targeting the unique
characteristics of tool learning: its multiple interdependent sub-tasks and
multi-valued reward functions. DSCL features two core components: Reward-Based
Dynamic Sampling, which uses multi-dimensional reward statistics (mean and
variance) to prioritize valuable data, and Task-Based Dynamic Curriculum
Learning, which adaptively focuses training on less-mastered sub-tasks. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DSCL significantly improves training
efficiency and model performance over strong baselines, achieving a 3.29\%
improvement on the BFCLv3 benchmark. Our method provides a tailored solution
that effectively leverages the complex reward signals and sub-task dynamics
within tool learning to achieve superior results.

  Paralinguistic sounds, like laughter and sighs, are crucial for synthesizing

  Reward models are central to both reinforcement learning (RL) with language
models and inference-time verification. However, existing reward models often
lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable
RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more
reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training. This
temporal-difference (TD) regularization produces smooth rewards and improves
alignment with long-term objectives. Incorporating TDRM into the actor-critic
style online RL loop yields consistent empirical gains. It is worth noting that
TDRM is a supplement to verifiable reward methods, and both can be used in
series. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve
performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%)
settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable
performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to
attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies on 8 model variants

Title: Mind the Gap: Data Rewriting for Stable Off-Policy Supervised
  Fine-Tuning
Authors: Shiwan Zhao, Xuyang Zhao, Jiaming Zhou, Aobo Kong, Qicheng Li, Yong
  Qin
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models can be viewed as an
off-policy learning problem, where expert demonstrations come from a fixed
behavior policy while training aims to optimize a target policy. Importance
sampling is the standard tool for correcting this distribution mismatch, but
large policy gaps lead to high variance and training instability. Existing
approaches mitigate this issue using KL penalties or clipping, which passively
constrain updates rather than actively reducing the gap. We propose a simple
yet effective data rewriting framework that proactively shrinks the policy gap
by keeping correct solutions as on-policy data and rewriting incorrect ones
with guided re-solving, falling back to expert demonstrations only when needed.
This aligns the training distribution with the target policy before
optimization, reducing importance sampling variance and stabilizing off-policy
fine-tuning. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
consistent and significant gains over both vanilla SFT and the state-of-the-art
Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) approach. The data and code will be released at

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement
learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands
models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing
label-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote
objectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an
entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike
prior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which
primarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is
broader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's
inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We
formalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free
Reinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with
variation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer
as a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors
responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced
(variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also
uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer
to sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design
prevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and
improves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the
majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts
Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5%
to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks
stronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we
demonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting,
highlighting its broad applicability.

Title: RLBind: Adversarial-Invariant Cross-Modal Alignment for Unified Robust
  Embeddings
Authors: Yuhong Lu
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
Comments: This paper is submitted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics
  and Automation (ICRA) 2026
\\
  Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into
a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception
and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to
adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for
safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within
CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding
modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a
two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust
unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on
clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages
cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between
clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise
distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,
Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the
LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy
and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without
sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer
multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,
and other autonomy settings.

Title: One-step Multi-view Clustering With Adaptive Low-rank Anchor-graph
  Learning

\\
  In light of their capability to capture structural information while reducing
computing complexity, anchor graph-based multi-view clustering (AGMC) methods
have attracted considerable attention in large-scale clustering problems.
Nevertheless, existing AGMC methods still face the following two issues: 1)
They directly embedded diverse anchor graphs into a consensus anchor graph
(CAG), and hence ignore redundant information and numerous noises contained in
these anchor graphs, leading to a decrease in clustering effectiveness; 2) They
drop effectiveness and efficiency due to independent post-processing to acquire
clustering indicators. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we deliver a
novel one-step multi-view clustering method with adaptive low-rank anchor-graph
learning (OMCAL). To construct a high-quality CAG, OMCAL provides a nuclear
norm-based adaptive CAG learning model against information redundancy and noise
interference. Then, to boost clustering effectiveness and efficiency
substantially, we incorporate category indicator acquisition and CAG learning
into a unified framework. Numerous studies conducted on ordinary and
large-scale datasets indicate that OMCAL outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods in terms of clustering effectiveness and efficiency.

Title: Designing Latent Safety Filters using Pre-Trained Vision Models
Authors: Ihab Tabbara, Yuxuan Yang, Ahmad Hamzeh, Maxwell Astafyev, and Hussein
  Sibai
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge
hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained
increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical
control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have
so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be
effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this
paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for
designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers
defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety
filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between
training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the
models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is
superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions
are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical
considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.

Title: QuizRank: Picking Images by Quizzing VLMs
Authors: Tenghao Ji, Eytan Adar
Categories: cs.HC cs.CV
\\
  Images play a vital role in improving the readability and comprehension of
Wikipedia articles by serving as `illustrative aids.' However, not all images
are equally effective and not all Wikipedia editors are trained in their
selection. We propose QuizRank, a novel method of image selection that
leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) to
rank images as learning interventions. Our approach transforms textual
descriptions of the article's subject into multiple-choice questions about
important visual characteristics of the concept. We utilize these questions to
quiz the VLM: the better an image can help answer questions, the higher it is
ranked. To further improve discrimination between visually similar items, we
introduce a Contrastive QuizRank that leverages differences in the features of
target (e.g., a Western Bluebird) and distractor concepts (e.g., Mountain
Bluebird) to generate questions. We demonstrate the potential of VLMs as
effective visual evaluators by showing a high congruence with human quiz-takers
and an effective discriminative ranking of images.

Title: Forecasting and Visualizing Air Quality from Sky Images with
  Vision-Language Models
Authors: Mohammad Saleh Vahdatpour, Maryam Eyvazi, Yanqing Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
Comments: Published at ICCVW 2025
\\
  Air pollution remains a critical threat to public health and environmental
sustainability, yet conventional monitoring systems are often constrained by
limited spatial coverage and accessibility. This paper proposes an AI-driven
agent that predicts ambient air pollution levels from sky images and
synthesizes realistic visualizations of pollution scenarios using generative
modeling. Our approach combines statistical texture analysis with supervised
learning for pollution classification, and leverages vision-language model
(VLM)-guided image generation to produce interpretable representations of air
quality conditions. The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of
pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve
transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs
can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing
situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time
forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and
demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and
semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further
incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility,
clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting. To support scalable
and energy-efficient deployment, future iterations will incorporate a green CNN
architecture enhanced with FPGA-based incremental learning, enabling real-time
inference on edge platforms.

  Modelling the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases demands
methods that capture heterogeneous and spatially varying dynamics from sparse,
high-dimensional neuroimaging data. Integrating partial differential equation
(PDE) based physics knowledge with machine learning provides enhanced
interpretability and utility over classic numerical methods. However, current
physics-integrated machine learning methods are limited to considering a single
PDE, severely limiting their application to diseases where multiple mechanisms
are responsible for different groups (i.e., subtypes) and aggravating problems
with model misspecification and degeneracy. Here, we present a deep generative
model for learning mixtures of latent dynamic models governed by physics-based
PDEs, going beyond traditional approaches that assume a single PDE structure.
Our method integrates reaction-diffusion PDEs within a variational autoencoder
(VAE) mixture model framework, supporting inference of subtypes of
interpretable latent variables (e.g. diffusivity and reaction rates) from
neuroimaging data. We evaluate our method on synthetic benchmarks and
demonstrate its potential for uncovering mechanistic subtypes of Alzheimer's
disease progression from positron emission tomography (PET) data.

Title: Doppler Radiance Field-Guided Antenna Selection for Improved
  Generalization in Multi-Antenna Wi-Fi-based Human Activity Recognition
Authors: Navid Hasanzadeh and Shahrokh Valaee
Categories: eess.SP cs.CV
\\
  With the IEEE 802.11bf Task Group introducing amendments to the WLAN standard
for advanced sensing, interest in using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
for remote sensing has surged. Recent findings indicate that learning a unified
three-dimensional motion representation through Doppler Radiance Fields (DoRFs)
derived from CSI significantly improves the generalization capabilities of
Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition (HAR). Despite this progress, CSI
signals remain affected by asynchronous access point (AP) clocks and additive
noise from environmental and hardware sources. Consequently, even with existing
preprocessing techniques, both the CSI data and Doppler velocity projections
used in DoRFs are still susceptible to noise and outliers, limiting HAR
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for
multi-antenna APs to suppress noise and identify the most informative antennas
based on DoRF fitting errors, which capture inconsistencies among Doppler
velocity projections. Experimental results on a challenging small-scale hand
gesture recognition dataset demonstrate that the proposed DoRF-guided
Wi-Fi-based HAR approach significantly improves generalization capability,
paving the way for robust real-world sensing deployments.

Title: From Pixels to Urban Policy-Intelligence: Recovering Legacy Effects of
  Redlining with a Multimodal LLM
Authors: Anthony Howell, Nancy Wu, Sharmistha Bagchi, Yushim Kim, Chayn Sun
Categories: cs.CY cs.CV
\\
  This paper shows how a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can expand
urban measurement capacity and support tracking of place-based policy
interventions. Using a structured, reason-then-estimate pipeline on street-view
imagery, GPT-4o infers neighborhood poverty and tree canopy, which we embed in
a quasi-experimental design evaluating the legacy of 1930s redlining. GPT-4o
recovers the expected adverse socio-environmental legacy effects of redlining,
with estimates statistically indistinguishable from authoritative sources, and
it outperforms a conventional pixel-based segmentation baseline-consistent with
the idea that holistic scene reasoning extracts higher-order information beyond
object counts alone. These results position MLLMs as policy-grade instruments
for neighborhood measurement and motivate broader validation across
policy-evaluation settings.

  Piano performance is a multimodal activity that intrinsically combines
physical actions with the acoustic rendition. Despite growing research interest
in analyzing the multimodal nature of piano performance, the laborious process
of acquiring large-scale multimodal data remains a significant bottleneck,
hindering further progress in this field. To overcome this barrier, we present
an integrated web toolkit comprising two graphical user interfaces (GUIs): (i)
PiaRec, which supports the synchronized acquisition of audio, video, MIDI, and
performance metadata. (ii) ASDF, which enables the efficient annotation of
performer fingering from the visual data. Collectively, this system can
streamline the acquisition of multimodal piano performance datasets.

Title: Taming Serverless Cold Starts Through OS Co-Design
Authors: Ben Holmes, Baltasar Dinis, Lana Honcharuk, Joshua Fried, Adam Belay
Categories: cs.OS cs.DC
\\
  Serverless computing promises fine-grained elasticity and operational
simplicity, fueling widespread interest from both industry and academia. Yet
this promise is undercut by the cold setart problem, where invoking a function
after a period of inactivity triggers costly initialization before any work can
begin. Even with today's high-speed storage, the prevailing view is that
achieving sub-millisecond cold starts requires keeping state resident in
memory.
  This paper challenges that assumption. Our analysis of existing
snapshot/restore mechanisms show that OS-level limitations, not storage speed,
are the real barrier to ultra-fast restores from disk. These limitations force
current systems to either restore state piecemeal in a costly manner or capture
too much state, leading to longer restore times and unpredictable performance.
Futhermore, current memory primitives exposed by the OS make it difficult to
reliably fetch data into memory and avoid costly runtime page faults.
  To overcome these barriers, we present Spice, an execution engine
purpose-built for serverless snapshot/restore. Spice integrates directly with
the OS to restore kernel state without costly replay and introduces dedicated
primitives for restoring memory mappings efficiently and reliably. As a result,
Spice delivers near-warm performance on cold restores from disk, reducing
latency by up to 14.9x over state-of-the-art process-based systems and 10.6x
over VM-based systems. This proves that high performance and memory elasticity
no longer need to be a trade-off in serverless computing.

  Hybrid quantum-high performance computing (Q-HPC) workflows are emerging as a
key strategy for running quantum applications at scale in current noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. These workflows must operate
seamlessly across diverse simulators and hardware backends since no single
simulator offers the best performance for every circuit type. Simulation
efficiency depends strongly on circuit structure, entanglement, and depth,
making a flexible and backend-agnostic execution model essential for fair
benchmarking, informed platform selection, and ultimately the identification of
quantum advantage opportunities. In this work, we extend the Quantum Framework
(QFw), a modular and HPC-aware orchestration layer, to integrate multiple local
backends (Qiskit Aer, NWQ-Sim, QTensor, and TN-QVM) and a cloud-based quantum
backend (IonQ) under a unified interface. Using this integration, we execute a
number of non-variational as well as variational workloads. The results
highlight workload-specific backend advantages: while Qiskit Aer's matrix
product state excels for large Ising models, NWQ-Sim not only leads on
large-scale entanglement and Hamiltonian but also shows the benefits of
concurrent subproblem execution in a distributed manner for optimization
problems. These findings demonstrate that simulator-agnostic, HPC-aware
orchestration is a practical path toward scalable, reproducible, and portable
Q-HPC ecosystems, thereby accelerating progress toward demonstrating quantum
advantage.

  In supervisory control settings, autonomous systems are not monitored
continuously. Instead, monitoring often occurs at sporadic intervals within
known bounds. We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a
private objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's
reference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real,
human supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the
representation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that
Theory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL)
toward such deceptive behavior. We model the supervisor's expectations and
distill from them a single, calibrated scalar -- the expected evidence of
deviation if an observation were to happen now. This scalar combines how unlike
the reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief
that an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a
KL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar
informs a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and
compliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies. In
real-world, real-time hardware experiments on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV)
navigation, our ToM-guided RL runs online, achieves high return and success
with observed-trace evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.

Title: Nonlinear Cooperative Salvo Guidance with Seeker-Limited Interceptors
Authors: Lohitvel Gopikannan, Shashi Ranjan Kumar, and Abhinav Sinha
Categories: eess.SY cs.MA cs.RO cs.SY
\\
  This paper presents a cooperative guidance strategy for the simultaneous
interception of a constant-velocity, non-maneuvering target, addressing the
realistic scenario where only a subset of interceptors are equipped with
onboard seekers. To overcome the resulting heterogeneity in target
observability, a fixed-time distributed observer is employed, enabling
seeker-less interceptors to estimate the target state using information from
seeker-equipped agents and local neighbors over a directed communication
topology. Departing from conventional strategies that approximate time-to-go
via linearization or small-angle assumptions, the proposed approach leverages
deviated pursuit guidance where the time-to-go expression is exact for such a
target. Moreover, a higher-order sliding mode consensus protocol is utilized to
establish time-to-go consensus within a finite time. The effectiveness of the
proposed guidance and estimation architecture is demonstrated through
simulations.
