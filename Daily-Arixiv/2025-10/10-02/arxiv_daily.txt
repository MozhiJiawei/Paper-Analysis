Title: BrowserArena: Evaluating LLM Agents on Real-World Web Navigation Tasks
Authors: Sagnik Anupam, Davis Brown, Shuo Li, Eric Wong, Hamed Hassani, Osbert
  Bastani
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Title: RefineShot: Rethinking Cinematography Understanding with Foundational
  Skill Evaluation
Authors: Hang Wu, Yujun Cai, Haonan Ge, Hongkai Chen, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Yiwei

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

Title: Safe and Efficient In-Context Learning via Risk Control
Authors: Andrea Wynn and Metod Jazbec and Charith Peris and Rinat Khaziev and
  Anqi Liu and Daniel Khashabi and Eric Nalisnick
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

Title: Multimodal Function Vectors for Spatial Relations
Authors: Shuhao Fu, Esther Goldberg, Ying Nian Wu, Hongjing Lu
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Title: Orchestrating Human-AI Teams: The Manager Agent as a Unifying Research
  Challenge

  Artificial Intelligence (DAI 2025). 8 pages, 2 figures
\\
  While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Title: Agentic Additive Manufacturing Alloy Discovery
Authors: Peter Pak, Achuth Chandrasekhar, Amir Barati Farimani
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials
science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language
Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their
extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and
lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Title: A Benchmark Study of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for the
  Container Stowage Planning Problem
Authors: Yunqi Huang, Nishith Chennakeshava, Alexis Carras, Vladislav Neverov,
  Wei Liu, Aske Plaat, Yingjie Fan
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Title: Multimodal Large Language Model Framework for Safe and Interpretable
  Grid-Integrated EVs
Authors: Jean Douglas Carvalho, Hugo Kenji, Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Glaucia Melo,
  Max Mauro Dias Santos, Deepa Kundur
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: This paper has been presented at the 2025 IEEE PES Conference on
  Innovative Smart Grid Technologies (ISGT 2025)
\\
  The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

Title: Mitigating Modal Imbalance in Multimodal Reasoning
Authors: Chen Henry Wu, Neil Kale and Aditi Raghunathan
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 10 pages, 10 figures, CoLM 2025
\\
  Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

Title: On the Role of Temperature Sampling in Test-Time Scaling
Authors: Yuheng Wu, Azalia Mirhoseini, Thierry Tambe
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

\\
  This study presents the development of Geolog-IA, a novel conversational
system based on artificial intelligence that responds naturally to questions
about geology theses from the Central University of Ecuador. Our proposal uses
the Llama 3.1 and Gemini 2.5 language models, which are complemented by a
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture and an SQLite database. This
strategy allows us to overcome problems such as hallucinations and outdated
knowledge. The evaluation of Geolog-IA's performance with the BLEU metric
reaches an average of 0.87, indicating high consistency and accuracy in the
responses generated. The system offers an intuitive, web-based interface that
facilitates interaction and information retrieval for directors, teachers,
students, and administrative staff at the institution. This tool can be a key
support in education, training, and research and establishes a basis for future
applications in other disciplines.

Title: A Concept of Possibility for Real-World Events
Authors: Daniel G. Schwartz
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

Title: AutoMaAS: Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Architecture Search for Large
  Language Models
Authors: Bo Ma, Hang Li, ZeHua Hu, XiaoFan Gui, LuYao Liu, Simon Liu
Categories: cs.AI cs.HC cs.IR
\\
  Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

Title: ARMs: Adaptive Red-Teaming Agent against Multimodal Models with
  Plug-and-Play Attacks
Authors: Zhaorun Chen, Xun Liu, Mintong Kang, Jiawei Zhang, Minzhou Pan, Shuang
  Yang, Bo Li
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 60 pages, 16 figures
\\
  As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

\\
  Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

Title: Beyond the Final Answer: Evaluating the Reasoning Trajectories of
  Tool-Augmented Agents
Authors: Wonjoong Kim, Sangwu Park, Yeonjun In, Sein Kim, Dongha Lee, Chanyoung
  Park
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: Preprint. Under Review
\\
  Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

Title: Take Goodhart Seriously: Principled Limit on General-Purpose AI
  Optimization
Authors: Antoine Maier, Aude Maier, Tom David
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 9 pages, 1 figure. Under review
\\
  A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

  Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Title: Consolidating Reinforcement Learning for Multimodal Discrete Diffusion
  Models
Authors: Tianren Ma, Mu Zhang, Yibing Wang, Qixiang Ye
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Project Page: https://github.com/martian422/MaskGRPO
\\
  Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Title: Onto-Epistemological Analysis of AI Explanations

\\
  Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Title: From Facts to Foils: Designing and Evaluating Counterfactual
  Explanations for Smart Environments

  Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Title: A Study of Rule Omission in Raven's Progressive Matrices
Authors: Binze Li
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into multiagent systems has
opened new possibilities for collaborative reasoning and cooperation with AI
agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their
effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making.
We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied
Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task
coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we
examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised
combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend
our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless
collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent
performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the
system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In
addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for
iterative system development and demonstrations.

  Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

  Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

Title: Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For
  Amortized Learning
Authors: Wannan Yang, Xinchi Qiu, Lei Yu, Yuchen Zhang, Oliver Aobo Yang,
  Narine Kokhlikyan, Nicola Cancedda, Diego Garcia-Olano
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often
hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting
ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of
their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations.
These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during
inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning
(CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized
optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into
model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining
from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training
only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by
30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more
compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines
such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce
domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in
both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first
steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both
dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step
forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment
in production systems.

\\
  Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but can hallucinate and
mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows. We present RA-FSM
(Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research
assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance ->
Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a
deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries,
scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when
needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated
references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base
from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a
dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We
implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories:
analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative
synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews,
domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla
Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition
handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses
indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency
and cost overheads. The design emphasizes transparent, well-cited answers for
high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains.

Title: KAME: Tandem Architecture for Enhancing Knowledge in Real-Time
  Speech-to-Speech Conversational AI
Authors: So Kuroki, Yotaro Kubo, Takuya Akiba, Yujin Tang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI eess.AS
\\
  Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural,
low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic
understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech
recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech
synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency,
which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our
framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate
responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end
LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the
S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich
knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated
our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that
consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate
that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response
correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency
on par with the baseline.

Title: AMANDA: Agentic Medical Knowledge Augmentation for Data-Efficient
  Medical Visual Question Answering
Authors: Ziqing Wang, Chengsheng Mao, Xiaole Wen, Yuan Luo, Kaize Ding
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.MA
Comments: EMNLP Findings
\\
  Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise
in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in
low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing
Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks:
(i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the
medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to
incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we
propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical
knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical
knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for
comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds
the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive
experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial
improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is
available at https://github.com/REAL-Lab-NU/AMANDA.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by verifying candidate tokens
from a draft model against a larger target model. Recent judge decoding boosts
this process by relaxing verification criteria by accepting draft tokens that
may exhibit minor discrepancies from target model output, but existing methods
are restricted by their reliance on human annotations or tasks with verifiable
ground truths, limiting generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. We propose
SelfJudge, which trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target
model. Our method measures semantic preservation by assessing whether
token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses,
enabling automatic verifier training across diverse NLP tasks. Our experiments
show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge
decoding baselines, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM
inference.

  Training long-context language models to capture long-range dependencies
requires specialized data construction. Current approaches, such as generic
text concatenation or heuristic-based variants, frequently fail to guarantee
genuine long-range dependencies. We propose EntropyLong, a novel data
construction method that leverages predictive uncertainty to verify dependency
quality. Our approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves
semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility
by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy. This model-in-the-loop
verification ensures each dependency represents measurable information gain
rather than spurious correlation. We construct training samples with long-range
dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual
supplements. Using FineWebEdu and Cosmopedia, we generate a dataset of
128K-length sequences with verified dependencies. Models trained on this data
demonstrate significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, particularly in tasks
requiring distant information. Following instruction fine-tuning, our models
also achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2, demonstrating enhanced
long-context understanding. Extensive ablation studies further validate the
necessity and effectiveness of entropybased verification for long-context
training.

  While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational

LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data
generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral
consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real
user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural
dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior
simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating
a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example
critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit
considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.

Title: A High-Capacity and Secure Disambiguation Algorithm for Neural
  Linguistic Steganography
Authors: Yapei Feng, Feng Jiang, Shanhao Wu, Hua Zhong
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.CR
Comments: 13 pages,7 figures
\\
  Neural linguistic steganography aims to embed information
  into natural text while preserving statistical undetectability. A fundamental
challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers,
which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool,
addresses this ambiguity
  by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of
ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it
utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for
synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named
look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while
retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal
synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while
strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding
capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and
analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical
upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen
2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical
capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in
embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in
settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step
toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.

Title: Where Did It Go Wrong? Attributing Undesirable LLM Behaviors via
  Representation Gradient Tracing
Authors: Zhe Li, Wei Zhao, Yige Li, Jun Sun
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 16 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as
generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases.
Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI
safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter
gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that
diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and
its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to
provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training
data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking
harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge
contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at
sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis,
precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence
model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand,
audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is

FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine
learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into
declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and
probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the
first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex

Title: CRACQ: A Multi-Dimensional Approach To Automated Document Assessment
Authors: Ishak Soltani, Francisco Belo, Bernardo Tavares
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  This paper presents CRACQ, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework tailored
to evaluate documents across f i v e specific traits: Coherence, Rigor,
Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality. Building on insights from
traitbased Automated Essay Scoring (AES), CRACQ expands its fo-cus beyond
essays to encompass diverse forms of machine-generated text, providing a
rubricdriven and interpretable methodology for automated evaluation. Unlike
singlescore approaches, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural
signals into a cumulative assessment, enabling both holistic and trait-level
analysis. Trained on 500 synthetic grant pro-posals, CRACQ was benchmarked
against an LLM-as-a-judge and further tested on both strong and weak real
applications. Preliminary results in-dicate that CRACQ produces more stable and
interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though
challenges in reliability and domain scope remain

Title: Optimizing Long-Form Clinical Text Generation with Claim-Based Rewards
Authors: Samyak Jhaveri, Praphul Singh, Jangwon Kim, Tara Taghavi, Krishnaram

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise
alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We
present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form
clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic,
dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and
completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on
human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note
quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An
independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing
higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity,
with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively
clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely
represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world
settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or
billing preferences.

Title: Evaluating Uncertainty Quantification Methods in Argumentative Large
  Language Models

\\
  Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs)
is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this
groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in
argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making
based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We
conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification
tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment
of the UQ methods' effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself
is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when
intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results
demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ
strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

Title: Can Prompts Rewind Time for LLMs? Evaluating the Effectiveness of
  Prompted Knowledge Cutoffs
Authors: Xin Gao, Ruiyi Zhang, Daniel Du, Saurabh Mahindre, Sai Ashish
  Somayajula, Pengtao Xie
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but
their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate
predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than
reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability.
With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural
question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff?
In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier
knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the
extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic
shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while
prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly
queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce
forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally
related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous
evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full
dataset and evaluation code are available at

Title: DRIFT: Learning from Abundant User Dissatisfaction in Real-World
  Preference Learning
Authors: Yifan Wang, Bolian Li, Junlin Wu, Zhaoxuan Tan, Zheli Liu, Ruqi Zhang,
  Ananth Grama, Qingkai Zeng
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems,
code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user
dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through
refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit
satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches
are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human
annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative
pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world
DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy.
Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets
and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) /
+7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B)
on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods
such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are
particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on
WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory
capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to
narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves
preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show
that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training
that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/cacayaya/DRIFT.git.

  Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating
social media dynamics at scale, enabling studies that would be ethically or
logistically challenging with human subjects. However, the field lacks
standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic
social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the
SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting
framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable
for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for
training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the
cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic
realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale
dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse.
BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours,
capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through
pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The
dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types
(likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity
preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use
context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction
behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data
and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous,
ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an
evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for
building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation
and polarization.

Title: Breaking the MoE LLM Trilemma: Dynamic Expert Clustering with Structured
  Compression
Authors: Peijun Zhu, Ning Yang, Jiayu Wei, Jinghang Wu, Haijun Zhang

Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables. Under review as a conference paper at

\\
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load
imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a
unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression
to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering
procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter
and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic
embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's
architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each
cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely
low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per
group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage
hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to
specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and
the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision
scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled
with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption
to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our
framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total
parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and
lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates
that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient,
and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

Title: Small Language Models for Curriculum-based Guidance
Authors: Konstantinos Katharakis and Sippo Rossi and Raghava Rao Mukkamala
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  The adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in education
is still emerging. In this study, we explore the development and evaluation of
AI teaching assistants that provide curriculum-based guidance using a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source
small language models (SLMs). We benchmarked eight SLMs, including LLaMA 3.1,
IBM Granite 3.3, and Gemma 3 (7-17B parameters), against GPT-4o. Our findings
show that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match LLMs in
delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. Importantly, SLMs offer
significant sustainability benefits due to their lower computational and energy
requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without
depending on cloud infrastructure. This makes them not only cost-effective and
privacy-preserving but also environmentally responsible, positioning them as
viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions aiming to scale
personalized learning in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.

Title: mini-vec2vec: Scaling Universal Geometry Alignment with Linear
  Transformations
Authors: Guy Dar
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces
without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is
expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient
alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly
robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method
consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel
embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear
alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of
magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The
method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and
unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

\\
  Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables
non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a
central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset
played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to
structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies,
data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present
LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the
LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning
and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated
multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral
7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and
others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready
benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models
selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions
and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and
evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

Title: Language, Culture, and Ideology: Personalizing Offensiveness Detection
  in Political Tweets with Reasoning LLMs
Authors: Dzmitry Pihulski, Jan Koco\'n
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: To appear in the Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on
  Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)
\\
  We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political
discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives.
Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from
the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1,
o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets
as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas
(far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and
Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning
abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to
ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture
subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve
both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments,
suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced
sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

Title: Evaluating Bias in Spoken Dialogue LLMs for Real-World Decisions and
  Recommendations

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and
cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their
presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input
and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age,
gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn
conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications
for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of
multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using
Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized
statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like
Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o
Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models
generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to
age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group
disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn
conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in
end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable
audio-based interactive systems. To facilitate further research, we release the
FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code.

particularly focusing on the Land and Public Domain Code. A detailed graph
database was developed, which contains 2,872 nodes and 10,774 relationships,
aiding in the visualization of interconnections within legal texts. In
addition, advanced triple extraction techniques were utilized for knowledge,
demonstrating the effectiveness of models such as GPT-4o, GPT-4, and
Mistral-Large in identifying relationships and relevant metadata. Through these
technologies, the aim is to create a solid framework that allows Senegalese

Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but
the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we
searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by
modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and
language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract
vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated
images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses,
sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings
across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared
to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that
may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like
"maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing
predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that
the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than
language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly
abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

Title: DiffuSpec: Unlocking Diffusion Language Models for Speculative Decoding
Authors: Guanghao Li, Zhihui Fu, Min Fang, Qibin Zhao, Ming Tang, Chun Yuan,
  Jun Wang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the
autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token
requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by
employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified
in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR
drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the
drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that
uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts
in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR
verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,
parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally
highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right
path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a
speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two
practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this
lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and
(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size
based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across
benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing
diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for
speculative decoding.

  Improving air quality and addressing climate change relies on accurate
understanding and analysis of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions.
However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized,
while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain
inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret
emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address
this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent
tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge
base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and
peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and
question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering.
Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via
natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing
source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined
scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates that Emission-GPT
can extract key insights--such as point source distributions and sectoral
trends--directly from raw data with simple prompts. Its modular and extensible
architecture facilitates automation of traditionally manual workflows,
positioning Emission-GPT as a foundational tool for next-generation emission
inventory development and scenario-based assessment.

Title: Spiral of Silence in Large Language Model Agents

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views
often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority
positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language
models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly
applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central
question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical
language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for
examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled
conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona'
signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall
and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and
interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models
show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and
replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and
persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that
without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges
computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to
monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

Title: ChunkLLM: A Lightweight Pluggable Framework for Accelerating LLMs
  Inference
Authors: Haojie Ouyang, Jianwei Lv, Lei Ren, Chen Wei, Xiaojie Wang, Fangxiang

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and
computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the
self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers
have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to
alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic
incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively
address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable
training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter
(Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each
Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk
attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the
model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic
information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain
frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training.
Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK
Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference
phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is
detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference.
Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and
short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only
attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains
98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58%
key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum
speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of
120K long texts.

mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the
recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives,
primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large
language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may
present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled
in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the
idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the
response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question,
an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question
again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results
show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and
varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between
formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and
the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or
neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such
inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the
question asked.

Title: Beyond Manuals and Tasks: Instance-Level Context Learning for LLM Agents
Authors: Kuntai Cai, Juncheng Liu, Xianglin Yang, Zhaojie Niu, Xiaokui Xiao,

Comments: Under review at ICLR 2026
\\
  Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i)
environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules,
and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this
work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context,
instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to
a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes,
and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a
common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often
depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on
making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context
requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring,
validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We
formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce
our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration,
using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a
lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically
produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many
downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost.
Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent
gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate
in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By
transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our
method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM
agents.

Title: Training Dynamics of Parametric and In-Context Knowledge Utilization in
  Language Models
Authors: Minsung Kim, Dong-Kyum Kim, Jea Kwon, Nakyeong Yang, Kyomin Jung,

Comments: 16 pages
\\
  Large language models often encounter conflicts between in-context knowledge
retrieved at inference time and parametric knowledge acquired during
pretraining. Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable
to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge
fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of
retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of
what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks
producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and,
consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining
budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first
controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context
and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train
transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while
systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that
intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric
and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains
inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop
robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather
than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results
indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These
insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that
harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

Title: Pretraining with hierarchical memories: separating long-tail and common
  knowledge
Authors: Hadi Pouransari, David Grangier, C Thomas, Michael Kirchhof, Oncel
  Tuzel
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on
scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better.
Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a
fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited
inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a
memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing
hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large
hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During
pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and
add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge
in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor
capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through
trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters
model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank
obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the
parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size
of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We
find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across
transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet
selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge,
particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend
on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques
that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems
produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater
potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We
propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the
best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood
score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these
models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across
both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with
multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets
respectively.

Title: Learning to Route: A Rule-Driven Agent Framework for Hybrid-Source
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Authors: Haoyue Bai, Haoyu Wang, Shengyu Chen, Zhengzhang Chen, Lu-An Tang, Wei
  Cheng, Haifeng Chen, Yanjie Fu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general
Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios
where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external
knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while
largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and
efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable
infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research.
Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three
central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths
across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost
without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source
for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further
observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with
retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by
systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we
propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate
augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a
rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to
maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing
decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost.
Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher
accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Technical report
\\
  Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large
language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating
mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and
small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying
certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data
increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to
systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing
and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we
propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions
across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of
how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.
Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,
plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show
that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of
knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our
findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable
strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

  The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating Natural
Language (NL) queries into SQL varies significantly across databases (DBs). NL
queries are often expressed using a domain specific vocabulary, and mapping
these to the correct SQL requires an understanding of the embedded domain
expressions, their relationship to the DB schema structure. Existing benchmarks
rely on unrealistic, ad-hoc query specific textual hints for expressing domain
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for associating
structured domain statements at the database level. We present retrieval of
relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level
match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains
across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level
structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing
ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match
based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher
accuracy than other retrieval approaches.

Title: Words That Make Language Models Perceive
Authors: Sophie L. Wang, Phillip Isola, Brian Cheung
Categories: cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any
direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly
shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis
that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a
text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and
audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it
cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were
conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually
supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably
activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

  We present CLARITY (Clinical Assistant for Routing, Inference, and Triage),
an AI-driven platform designed to facilitate patient-to-specialist routing,
clinical consultations, and severity assessment of patients' conditions. Its
hybrid architecture combines a Finite State Machine (FSM) for structured

existing workflows and IT solutions in healthcare.
  We report integration of our clinical assistant into a large-scale
nation-wide inter-hospital IT platform, with over 55,000 content-rich user
dialogues completed within the two months of deployment, 2,500 of which were
expert-annotated for a consequent validation. The validation results show that
CLARITY surpasses human-level performance in terms of the first-attempt routing
precision, naturally requiring up to 3 times shorter duration of the
consultation than with a human.

Title: Unraveling Syntax: How Language Models Learn Context-Free Grammars
Authors: Laura Ying Schulz, Daniel Mitropolsky, Tomaso Poggio
Categories: cs.CL cs.FL cs.LG
Comments: Equal contribution by LYS and DM
\\
  We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire
syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about
their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most
domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages,
arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic
languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar
complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several
general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler
divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that
unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to
more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in
parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final
loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal
representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we
demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation
even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural
networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study
of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for
probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many
open questions.

Title: Hierarchical Semantic Retrieval with Cobweb

Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
Comments: 20 pages, 7 tables, 4 figures
\\
  Neural document retrieval often treats a corpus as a flat cloud of vectors
scored at a single granularity, leaving corpus structure underused and
explanations opaque. We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize
sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine
traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular
relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We
instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a
lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP
with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results
show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong
encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2
vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still
retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb
provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality,
scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

Title: Knowledge-Graph Based RAG System Evaluation Framework
Authors: Sicheng Dong, Vahid Zolfaghari, Nenad Petrovic, Alois Knoll
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is
utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of
the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However,
evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation
metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern
LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness.
Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended
this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop
reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive
scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we
gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on
their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare
its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to
assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In
addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based
evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated
outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and
highlight potential directions for future research.

Comments: ASRU 2025
\\
  Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language
models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech
encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we
know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we
examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and
Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA
representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models
using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using
an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in
instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs
instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words.
We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is
trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

Title: Evaluation Framework for Highlight Explanations of Context Utilisation
  in Language Models
Authors: Jingyi Sun, Pepa Atanasova, Sagnik Ray Choudhury, Sekh Mainul Islam,
  Isabelle Augenstein
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate
relevant information from the provided context when generating responses,
remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from
parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context
pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural
solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced
model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in
accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing
the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using
controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the
limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the
framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three
established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach
we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and
five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context
scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit
positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy
that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation
explanations at scale.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing
applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate
differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we
present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when
users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals
significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical
diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest
that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not
adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM
chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication
style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation
during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message
reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically
diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original
or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved
less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved
LLM-user interaction experiences.

\\
  Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in
complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of
reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages
due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks.
To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method
that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step
transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge
Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information
into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to
understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT
effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain
consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations
in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several
strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to
various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free
strategies for further improvements. Our code is available at

  Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book
factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored,
despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ
for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to
quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic,
token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the
predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution.
By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate
the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive
an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as
semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to
the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA
task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance
(using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context
comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty
(avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we
extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and
ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA
benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that
our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
(sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a
13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their
robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing
evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments,
failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that
characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing
36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a
time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox
proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest
approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt,
prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing
the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative
drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling
significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate
superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional
calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm
for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient
conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity
of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

Title: TravelBench : Exploring LLM Performance in Low-Resource Domains
Authors: Srinivas Billa, Xiaonan Jing
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model
capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective
solutions in these domains. To address these challenges, we curated 14
travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from
real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on
the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a
variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are
insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite
the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks
in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more
significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on
certain tasks.

Title: PGMEL: Policy Gradient-based Generative Adversarial Network for
  Multimodal Entity Linking
Authors: KM Pooja, Cheng Long and Aixin Sun
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their
respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention
due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity
linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive
embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of
high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in
metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of
MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a
generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for
generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the
responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved
in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy
gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial
network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on
Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns
meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across critical
domains owing to their impressive contextual understanding and generative
capabilities. However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications
necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally
diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment
methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an
evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that
captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a
novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and
Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five
demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic
status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models
exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being
notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global
debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training
typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this
work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach
alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To
minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in
self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to
assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging
yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model
recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively
requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on
nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra
data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of
self-evolving agent training.

  Alignments

Comments: 2025 EMNLP Findings
\\
  Cross-lingual topic modeling aims to uncover shared semantic themes across
languages. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem,
leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have
achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure
high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA
(Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a
novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual
embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment,
aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared
semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions
into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism
enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and
well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that
XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity,
and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https:

Title: A Computational Framework for Interpretable Text-Based Personality
  Assessment from Social Media
Authors: Matej Gjurkovi\'c
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.SI
Comments: Phd thesis
\\
  Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and
feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from
social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become
increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis
of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main
challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,
personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology
and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these
challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --
collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse
discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000
users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic
information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.
Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model
validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality
Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for
interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements
with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic
similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human
evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although
focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this
domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make
it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex
label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.

Title: StepChain GraphRAG: Reasoning Over Knowledge Graphs for Multi-Hop
  Question Answering
Authors: Tengjun Ni, Xin Yuan, Shenghong Li, Kai Wu, Ren Ping Liu, Wei Ni, and
  Wenjie Zhang
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
\\
  Recent progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has led to more
accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering (QA). Yet, challenges
persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge
retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that
unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow
for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the
corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a
knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each
sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges,
assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model
with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA
show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1
scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the
SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).
StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the
chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing
how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential
hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability
in multi-hop QA.

Title: Evaluating Large Language Models for IUCN Red List Species Information
Authors: Shinya Uryu
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 20 pages, 7 figures
ACM-class: I.2.7; I.2.6; J.3
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to
address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation
is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955
species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy,
conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was
revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently
failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This
knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent
architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models
exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially
amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear
boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for
information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions.
A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while
human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

  Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic
entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint
treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with
novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy,
computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw
candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian
word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315
English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9%
success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward
Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms
versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3
percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic
CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint
recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates
88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP
principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from
linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source
implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides
reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP
treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration,
robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance
benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques
outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for
structured puzzle-solving domains.

Title: Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 24 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via
long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process
is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for
self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs
revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training,
both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose
Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time
framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token
generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify
high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific
corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a
self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By
retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more
trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors
at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model
reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger
self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on
Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a
plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for
reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and
broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g.,
SLOT) techniques.

Title: Leave No TRACE: Black-box Detection of Copyrighted Dataset Usage in
  Large Language Models via Watermarking
Authors: Jingqi Zhang, Ruibo Chen, Yingqing Yang, Peihua Mai, Heng Huang, Yan
  Pang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller,
domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets
often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for
reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference
attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to
internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely
on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of
which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative,
but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We
propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of
copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets
with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text
quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity
effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated
procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially
amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE
consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely
strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution
and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked
corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable
black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code
available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.

Title: Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical Evidence: A
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for Querying UK NICE Clinical
  Guidelines
Authors: Matthew Lewis, Samuel Thio, Richard JB Dobson, Spiros Denaxas
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR
\\
  This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language
Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede
their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this
project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users
with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The
system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was
evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred
guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten
retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.
  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the
generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy
question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in
performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the
source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the
RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused
Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context
Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability
to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source
material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and
scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling
cost-effective access to medical guidelines.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Accepted to the *SEM conference collocated with EMNLP2025
\\
  Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for improving human-computer
interaction, yet its accuracy remains constrained by the complexity of
emotional nuances in speech. In this study, we distinguish between descriptive
semantics, which represents the contextual content of speech, and expressive
semantics, which reflects the speaker's emotional state. After watching
emotionally charged movie segments, we recorded audio clips of participants
describing their experiences, along with the intended emotion tags for each
clip, participants' self-rated emotional responses, and their valence/arousal
scores. Through experiments, we show that descriptive semantics align with
intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.
Our findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and pave the way
for more context-aware AI systems.

Title: Revisiting Direct Speech-to-Text Translation with Speech LLMs: Better
  Scaling than CoT Prompting?
Authors: Oriol Pareras, Gerard I. G\'allego, Federico Costa, Cristina

Categories: cs.CL cs.SD
\\
  Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based
models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it.
CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit
abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT)
datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically
compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this
end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six
European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting
strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more
consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a
more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.

Title: Semantic Similarity in Radiology Reports via LLMs and NER
Authors: Beth Pearson, Ahmed Adnan, Zahraa Abdallah
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and
plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard
reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary
report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce
the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and
final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to
help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly
growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we
explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of
reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of
several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional
approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches
exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To
address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method
using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or
de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a
quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an
interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing
and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match
accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided
ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently. Code

Categories: cs.CL cs.SD
\\
  Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) systems built from Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) modules face two major
limitations: error propagation and the inability to exploit prosodic or other
acoustic cues. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently been introduced,
with the expectation that jointly accessing speech and transcription will
overcome these issues. Analyzing CoT through attribution methods, robustness
evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness, we find that it
largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely
leveraging speech. Simple training interventions, such as adding Direct S2TT
data or noisy transcript injection, enhance robustness and increase speech
attribution. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and
highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic
information into translation.

  Academic survey writing, which distills vast literature into a coherent and

task. While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and
survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a.
LLM4Survey), their outputs often fall short of human standards and there lacks
a rigorous, reader-aligned benchmark for thoroughly revealing their
deficiencies. To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven
evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source
from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys;

Title: Beyond the Final Layer: Intermediate Representations for Better
  Multilingual Calibration in Large Language Models
Authors: Ej Zhou, Caiqi Zhang, Tiancheng Hu, Chengzu Li, Nigel Collier, Ivan
  Vuli\'c, Anna Korhonen
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Confidence calibration, the alignment of a model's predicted confidence with
its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored
in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale,
systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and
over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from
systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's
internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by
English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence.
In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that
late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and
better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of
training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE),
which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific
language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment
and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy
LLMs by looking beyond the final layer.

Title: EditLens: Quantifying the Extent of AI Editing in Text
Authors: Katherine Thai, Bradley Emi, Elyas Masrour, Mohit Iyyer
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  A significant proportion of queries to large language models ask them to edit
user-provided text, rather than generate new text from scratch. While previous
work focuses on detecting fully AI-generated text, we demonstrate that
AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text.
First, we propose using lightweight similarity metrics to quantify the
magnitude of AI editing present in a text given the original human-written text
and validate these metrics with human annotators. Using these similarity
metrics as intermediate supervision, we then train EditLens, a regression model
that predicts the amount of AI editing present within a text. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary (F1=94.7%) and ternary
(F1=90.4%) classification tasks in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.
Not only do we show that AI-edited text can be detected, but also that the
degree of change made by AI to human writing can be detected, which has
implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. Finally, as a
case study, we use our model to analyze the effects of AI-edits applied by
Grammarly, a popular writing assistance tool. To encourage further research, we
commit to publicly releasing our models and dataset.

Title: Neural Correlates of Language Models Are Specific to Human Language
Authors: I\~nigo Parra
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: To be presented at NeurIPS 2025 Workshops
\\
  Previous work has shown correlations between the hidden states of large
language models and fMRI brain responses, on language tasks. These correlations
have been taken as evidence of the representational similarity of these models
and brain states. This study tests whether these previous results are robust to
several possible concerns. Specifically this study shows: (i) that the previous
results are still found after dimensionality reduction, and thus are not
attributable to the curse of dimensionality; (ii) that previous results are
confirmed when using new measures of similarity; (iii) that correlations
between brain representations and those from models are specific to models
trained on human language; and (iv) that the results are dependent on the
presence of positional encoding in the models. These results confirm and
strengthen the results of previous research and contribute to the debate on the
biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art large language
models.

Title: Topic Modeling as Long-Form Generation: Can Long-Context LLMs
  revolutionize NTM via Zero-Shot Prompting?
Authors: Xuan Xu, Haolun Li, Zhongliang Yang, Beilin Chu, Jia Song, Moxuan Xu,
  Linna Zhou
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Traditional topic models such as neural topic models rely on inference and
generation networks to learn latent topic distributions. This paper explores a
new paradigm for topic modeling in the era of large language models, framing TM
as a long-form generation task whose definition is updated in this paradigm. We
propose a simple but practical approach to implement LLM-based topic model
tasks out of the box (sample a data subset, generate topics and representative
text with our prompt, text assignment with keyword match). We then investigate
whether the long-form generation paradigm can beat NTMs via zero-shot
prompting. We conduct a systematic comparison between NTMs and LLMs in terms of
topic quality and empirically examine the claim that "a majority of NTMs are
outdated."

Title: Model-Based Ranking of Source Languages for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual
  Transfer
Authors: Abteen Ebrahimi, Adam Wiemerslage, Katharina von der Wense
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main)
\\
  We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for
cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from
multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two
pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and
named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on
56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain
data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and
linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and
18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level
features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains
competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large
number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show
that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces
high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all
available target data for ranking.

  Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web
page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of
thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational
cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security
risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard
relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action
prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that
leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from
accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning
noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while
reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and
WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong
baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant
of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection
attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success
performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted
LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents
that are efficient, effective, and secure.

  Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large
Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a
single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing
internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This
process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token
generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs
communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache
semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,
supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,
we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic
communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the
source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic
transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit
from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the
deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit
intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%
higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text
communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average
2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at

Title: Self-Anchor: Large Language Model Reasoning via Step-by-step Attention
  Alignment
Authors: Hongxiang Zhang and Yuan Tian and Tianyi Zhang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs),
prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical
intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context,
receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we
propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of
reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories
into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the
most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout
generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting
methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the
performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning
models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning
tasks without retraining.

Title: Reward Models are Metrics in a Trench Coat
Authors: Sebastian Gehrmann
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language
models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess
the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is
also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI
model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to
redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include
susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,
methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our
position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help
overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward
models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.
Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer
alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference
elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and
calibration-aware meta-evaluation.

\\
  Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards-- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

Title: PhysHMR: Learning Humanoid Control Policies from Vision for Physically
  Plausible Human Motion Reconstruction
Authors: Qiao Feng, Yiming Huang, Yufu Wang, Jiatao Gu, Lingjie Liu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

Comments:
\\
  Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

Title: How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their
  Uncertainty
Authors: Zhiting Mei, Ola Shorinwa, Anirudha Majumdar
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

Title: PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained
  Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization
Authors: Hovhannes Margaryan, Bo Wan, Tinne Tuytelaars
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

\\
  Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

Title: Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation
Authors: Beijia Lu, Ziyi Chen, Jing Xiao, Jun-Yan Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Project Page: https://beijia11.github.io/IASA
\\
  Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

Title: Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA
Authors: Victor Enescu, Hichem Sahbi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

Title: Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light
  Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Abhishek Joshi, Jahnavi Krishna Koda, Abhishek Phadke
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,

Title: Smart-GRPO: Smartly Sampling Noise for Efficient RL of Flow-Matching
  Models
Authors: Benjamin Yu, Jackie Liu, Justin Cui
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

Title: FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 3min
Authors: Yibin Zhao and Yihan Pan and Jun Nan and Jianjun Yi
Categories: cs.CV cs.GR
\\
  Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

Title: MoGIC: Boosting Motion Generation via Intention Understanding and Visual
  Context
Authors: Junyu Shi, Yong Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Lijiang Liu, Zhengjie Zhang, Yuxin
  He and Qiang Nie
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

Title: From Tokens to Nodes: Semantic-Guided Motion Control for Dynamic 3D
  Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Jianing Chen, Zehao Li, Yujun Cai, Hao Jiang, Shuqin Gao, Honglong
  Zhao, Tianlu Mao, Yucheng Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Net2Net: When Un-trained Meets Pre-trained Networks for Robust
  Real-World Denoising
Authors: Weimin Yuan, Cai Meng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

Title: Retrv-R1: A Reasoning-Driven MLLM Framework for Universal and Efficient
  Multimodal Retrieval
Authors: Lanyun Zhu, Deyi Ji, Tianrun Chen, Haiyang Wu, Shiqi Wang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: NeurIPS 2025
\\
  The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Title: Bayesian Test-time Adaptation for Object Recognition and Detection with
  Vision-language Models
Authors: Lihua Zhou, Mao Ye, Shuaifeng Li, Nianxin Li, Jinlin Wu, Xiatian Zhu,

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Under Review
\\
  Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

Title: Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor
  Classification in Digital Pathology
Authors: Matthias Perkonigg, Patrick Rockenschaub, Georg G\"obel and Adelheid
  W\"ohrer
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

Title: AdaRD-key: Adaptive Relevance-Diversity Keyframe Sampling for Long-form
  Video understanding
Authors: Xian Zhang, Zexi Wu, Zinuo Li, Hongming Xu, Luqi Gong, Farid Boussaid,
  Naoufel Werghi, Mohammed Bennamoun
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

Journal-ref: COLM 2025: First Workshop on the Application of LLM Explainability
  to Reasoning and Planning
\\
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

  Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

Title: Align Your Query: Representation Alignment for Multimodality Medical
  Object Detection
Authors: Ara Seo, Bryan Sangwoo Kim, Hyungjin Chung, Jong Chul Ye
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Project page: https://araseo.github.io/alignyourquery/
\\
  Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

  Decoding
Authors: Jingyuan Deng, Yujiu Yang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL cs.MM
Comments: accepted to emnlp2025 findings
\\
  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

  Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

  Synthesis
Authors: Feng Yuan, Yifan Gao, Yuehua Ye, Haoyue Li, Xin Gao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ICLR2026 under review
\\
  Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

\\
  Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at

Title: One Patch to Caption Them All: A Unified Zero-Shot Captioning Framework

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

  Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, includ- ing DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learn- ing by providing rich features that generalize
well across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out- of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmen- tation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direc- tion for

Title: Don't Just Chase "Highlighted Tokens" in MLLMs: Revisiting Visual
  Holistic Context Retention
Authors: Xin Zou, Di Lu, Yizhou Wang, Yibo Yan, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Xu Zheng,

\\
  Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

Title: Zero-Shot Robustness of Vision Language Models Via Confidence-Aware
  Weighting
Authors: Nikoo Naghavian, Mostafa Tavassolipour
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Reliable ML from Unreliable
  Data
\\
  Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

  Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

  Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

  Text-to-Image-to-Text Consistency
Authors: Juntong Wang and Huiyu Duan and Jiarui Wang and Ziheng Jia and
  Guangtao Zhai and Xiongkuo Min
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

Title: Towards Scalable and Consistent 3D Editing
Authors: Ruihao Xia, Yang Tang, Pan Zhou
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

Title: Not every day is a sunny day: Synthetic cloud injection for deep land
  cover segmentation robustness evaluation across data sources
Authors: Sara Mobsite, Renaud Hostache, Laure Berti Equille, Emmanuel Roux, and
  Joris Guerin
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

  Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event

\\
  Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

\\
  Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

Title: Geometry Meets Vision: Revisiting Pretrained Semantics in Distilled
  Fields
Authors: Zhiting Mei, Ola Shorinwa, Anirudha Majumdar
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

Title: GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image
  Completion
Authors: Beibei Lin, Tingting Chen, Robby T. Tan
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by NeurIPS 2025. Project page:
  https://bb12346.github.io/GeoComplete/
\\
  Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

Title: Taming Text-to-Sounding Video Generation via Advanced Modality Condition
  and Interaction
Authors: Kaisi Guan, Xihua Wang, Zhengfeng Lai, Xin Cheng, Peng Zhang,

Categories: cs.CV cs.SD
\\
  This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

Title: HAVIR: HierArchical Vision to Image Reconstruction using CLIP-Guided
  Versatile Diffusion
Authors: Shiyi Zhang, Dong Liang, Hairong Zheng, Yihang Zhou
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

Comments: Project page: https://reagan1311.github.io/mask2iv
\\
  Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and

  Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

Title: UniShield: An Adaptive Multi-Agent Framework for Unified Forgery Image
  Detection and Localization
Authors: Qing Huang, Zhipei Xu, Xuanyu Zhang, Jian Zhang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

\\
  We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

Title: Dynamic Prompt Generation for Interactive 3D Medical Image Segmentation
  Training
Authors: Tidiane Camaret Ndir, Alexander Pfefferle, Robin Tibor Schirrmeister
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Interactive 3D biomedical image segmentation requires efficient models that
can iteratively refine predictions based on user prompts. Current foundation
models either lack volumetric awareness or suffer from limited interactive
capabilities. We propose a training strategy that combines dynamic volumetric
prompt generation with content-aware adaptive cropping to optimize the use of
the image encoder. Our method simulates realistic user interaction patterns
during training while addressing the computational challenges of learning from
sequential refinement feedback on a single GPU. For efficient training, we
initialize our network using the publicly available weights from the
nnInteractive segmentation model. Evaluation on the \textbf{Foundation Models
for Interactive 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation} competition demonstrates
strong performance with an average final Dice score of 0.6385, normalized
surface distance of 0.6614, and area-under-the-curve metrics of 2.4799 (Dice)
and 2.5671 (NSD).

Title: Product-Quantised Image Representation for High-Quality Image Synthesis
Authors: Denis Zavadski, Nikita Philip Tatsch, Carsten Rother
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

Title: Memory Forcing: Spatio-Temporal Memory for Consistent Scene Generation
  on Minecraft
Authors: Junchao Huang, Xinting Hu, Boyao Han, Shaoshuai Shi, Zhuotao Tian,
  Tianyu He, and Li Jiang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 19 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

Authors: Luca Collorone, Matteo Gioia, Massimiliano Pappa, Paolo Leoni,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

Title: Test-Time Defense Against Adversarial Attacks via Stochastic Resonance
  of Latent Ensembles
Authors: Dong Lao, Yuxiang Zhang, Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie, Yangchao Wu, Alex
  Wong, Stefano Soatto
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

Title: MIXER: Mixed Hyperspherical Random Embedding Neural Network for Texture
  Recognition
Authors: Ricardo T. Fares and Lucas C. Ribas
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

Title: Improving GUI Grounding with Explicit Position-to-Coordinate Mapping
Authors: Suyuchen Wang, Tianyu Zhang, Ahmed Masry, Christopher Pal, Spandana
  Gella, Bang Liu, Perouz Taslakian
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

Title: LEAML: Label-Efficient Adaptation to Out-of-Distribution Visual Tasks
  for Multimodal Large Language Models
Authors: Ci-Siang Lin, Min-Hung Chen, Yu-Yang Sheng, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

\\
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models promise efficient scaling of large language
models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of experts per token, but their
parallelized inference pipelines make elastic serving challenging. Existing
strategies fall short: horizontal scaling provisions entire replicas of the
current configuration, often tens to hundreds of accelerators, leading to
coarse granularity, long provisioning delays, and costly overprovisioning.
Vertical scaling offers finer adjustments but typically requires instance
restarts, incurring downtime. These limitations make current approaches
ill-suited for the bursty, short-lived traffic patterns common in cloud
deployments.
  We present ElasticMoE, an elastic scaling framework for MoE LLMs that
achieves fine-grained, low-latency, and zero-downtime scaling. ElasticMoE
decouples inference execution from memory operations, enabling scaling steps to
proceed concurrently with serving. An HBM Management Module (HMM) reuses
weights and KV caches via zero-copy remapping, while high-bandwidth
peer-to-peer transfers bring newly added accelerators online without
interrupting service. A virtual memory based expert redistribution mechanism
migrates MoE experts without costly buffer reallocations, reducing peak memory
usage during expert parallelism reconfiguration.
  Our evaluation on Ascend NPUs with three popular MoE LLMs shows that
ElasticMoE achieves up to 9x lower scale-up latency, up to 2x better throughput
during scaling, and significantly improves SLO attainment compared to
baselines. By enabling fine-grained, concurrent scaling with minimal
disruption, ElasticMoE advances the practicality of deploying massive MoE LLMs
in dynamic cloud environments.

  Approximate Nearest Neighbor Graph Construction
Authors: Xiang Li (Nanjing University), Qiong Chang (Institute of Science
  Tokyo), Yun Li (Nanjing University), and Jun Miyazaki (Institute of Science
  Tokyo)
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Relative Nearest Neighbor Descent (RNN-Descent) is a state-of-the-art
algorithm for constructing sparse approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) graphs by
combining the iterative refinement of NN-Descent with the edge-pruning rules of
the Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG). It has demonstrated strong effectiveness
in large-scale search tasks such as information retrieval and related tasks.
However, as the amount and dimensionality of data increase, the complexity of
graph construction in RNN-Descent rises sharply, making this stage increasingly
time-consuming and even prohibitive for subsequent query processing. In this
paper, we propose GRNND, the first GPU-parallel algorithm of RNN-Descent
designed to fully exploit GPU architecture. GRNND introduces a disordered
neighbor propagation strategy to mitigate synchronized update traps, enhancing
structural diversity, and avoiding premature convergence during parallel
execution. It also leverages warp-level cooperative operations and a
double-buffered neighbor pool with fixed capacity for efficient memory access,
eliminate contention, and enable highly parallelized neighbor updates.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRNND consistently outperforms existing
CPU- and GPU-based methods. GRNND achieves 2.4 to 51.7x speedup over existing
GPU methods, and 17.8 to 49.8x speedup over CPU methods.

Authors: Yifei Xia, Fangcheng Fu, Hao Yuan, Hanke Zhang, Xupeng Miao, Yijun

Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Diffusion pipelines, renowned for their powerful visual generation
capabilities, have seen widespread adoption in generative vision tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image/video). These pipelines typically follow an
encode--diffuse--decode three-stage architecture. Current serving systems
deploy diffusion pipelines within a static, manual, and pipeline-level
paradigm, allocating the same resources to every request and stage. However,
through an in-depth analysis, we find that such a paradigm is inefficient due
to the discrepancy in resource needs across the three stages of each request,
as well as across different requests. Following the analysis, we propose the
dynamic stage-level serving paradigm and develop TridentServe, a brand new
diffusion serving system. TridentServe automatically, dynamically derives the
placement plan (i.e., how each stage resides) for pipeline deployment and the
dispatch plan (i.e., how the requests are routed) for request processing,
co-optimizing the resource allocation for both model and requests. Extensive
experiments show that TridentServe consistently improves SLO attainment and
reduces average/P95 latencies by up to 2.5x and 3.6x/4.1x over existing works
across a variety of workloads.

\\
  We investigate the energy efficiency of a library designed for parallel
computations with sparse matrices. The library leverages high-performance,
energy-efficient Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerators to enable
large-scale scientific applications. Our primary development objective was to
maximize parallel performance and scalability in solving sparse linear systems
whose dimensions far exceed the memory capacity of a single node. To this end,
we devised methods that expose a high degree of parallelism while optimizing
algorithmic implementations for efficient multi-GPU usage. Previous work has
already demonstrated the library's performance efficiency on large-scale
systems comprising thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, achieving improvements over
state-of-the-art solutions. In this paper, we extend those results by providing
energy profiles that address the growing sustainability requirements of modern
HPC platforms. We present our methodology and tools for accurate runtime energy
measurements of the library's core components and discuss the findings. Our
results confirm that optimizing GPU computations and minimizing data movement
across memory and computing nodes reduces both time-to-solution and energy
consumption. Moreover, we show that the library delivers substantial advantages
over comparable software frameworks on standard benchmarks.

Title: Energy Efficiency in Cloud-Based Big Data Processing for Earth
  Observation: Gap Analysis and Future Directions
Authors: Adhitya Bhawiyuga, Serkan Girgin, Rolf A. de By, Raul Zurita-Milla
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Earth observation (EO) data volumes are rapidly increasing. While cloud
computing are now used for processing large EO datasets, the energy efficiency
aspects of such a processing have received much less attention. This issue is
notable given the increasing awareness of energy costs and carbon footprint in
big data processing, particularly with increased attention on compute-intensive
foundation models. In this paper we identify gaps in energy efficiency
practices within cloud-based EO big data (EOBD) processing and propose several
research directions for improvement. We first examine the current EOBD
landscape, focus on the requirements that necessitate cloud-based processing
and analyze existing cloud-based EOBD solutions. We then investigate energy
efficiency strategies that have been successfully employed in well-studied big
data domains. Through this analysis, we identify several critical gaps in
existing EOBD processing platforms, which primarily focus on data accessibility
and computational feasibility, instead of energy efficiency. These gaps include
insufficient energy monitoring mechanisms, lack of energy awareness in data
management, inadequate implementation of energy-aware resource allocation and
lack of energy efficiency criteria on task scheduling. Based on these findings,
we propose the development of energy-aware performance monitoring and
benchmarking frameworks, the use of optimization techniques for infrastructure
orchestration, and of energy-efficient task scheduling approaches for
distributed cloud-based EOBD processing frameworks. These proposed approaches
aim to foster more energy awareness in EOBD processing , potentially reducing
power consumption and environmental impact while maintaining or minimally
impacting processing performance.

  The intelligent Distributed Dispatch and Scheduling (iDDS) service is a
versatile workflow orchestration system designed for large-scale, distributed
scientific computing. iDDS extends traditional workload and data management by
integrating data-aware execution, conditional logic, and programmable
workflows, enabling automation of complex and dynamic processing pipelines.
Originally developed for the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider,
iDDS has evolved into an experiment-agnostic platform that supports both
template-driven workflows and a Function-as-a-Task model for Python-based
orchestration.
  This paper presents the architecture and core components of iDDS,
highlighting its scalability, modular message-driven design, and integration
with systems such as PanDA and Rucio. We demonstrate its versatility through
real-world use cases: fine-grained tape resource optimization for ATLAS,
orchestration of large Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) workflows for the Rubin
Observatory, distributed hyperparameter optimization for machine learning
applications, active learning for physics analyses, and AI-assisted detector
design at the Electron-Ion Collider.
  By unifying workload scheduling, data movement, and adaptive decision-making,
iDDS reduces operational overhead and enables reproducible, high-throughput
workflows across heterogeneous infrastructures. We conclude with current
challenges and future directions, including interactive, cloud-native, and
serverless workflow support.

shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Title: Modeling the Attack: Detecting AI-Generated Text by Quantifying
  Adversarial Perturbations

  The growth of highly advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) constitutes a huge
dual-use problem, making it necessary to create dependable AI-generated text
detection systems. Modern detectors are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, with paraphrasing standing out as an effective evasion technique that
foils statistical detection. This paper presents a comparative study of
adversarial robustness, first by quantifying the limitations of standard
adversarial training and then by introducing a novel, significantly more
resilient detection framework: Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering
(PIFE), a framework that enhances detection by first transforming input text
into a standardized form using a multi-stage normalization pipeline, it then
quantifies the transformation's magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein
distance and semantic similarity, feeding these signals directly to the
classifier. We evaluate both a conventionally hardened Transformer and our
PIFE-augmented model against a hierarchical taxonomy of character-, word-, and
sentence-level attacks. Our findings first confirm that conventional
adversarial training, while resilient to syntactic noise, fails against
semantic attacks, an effect we term "semantic evasion threshold", where its
True Positive Rate at a strict 1% False Positive Rate plummets to 48.8%. In
stark contrast, our PIFE model, which explicitly engineers features from the
discrepancy between a text and its canonical form, overcomes this limitation.
It maintains a remarkable 82.6% TPR under the same conditions, effectively
neutralizing the most sophisticated semantic attacks. This superior performance
demonstrates that explicitly modeling perturbation artifacts, rather than
merely training on them, is a more promising path toward achieving genuine
robustness in the adversarial arms race.

Title: Agentic-AI Healthcare: Multilingual, Privacy-First Framework with MCP
  Agents
Authors: Mohammed A. Shehab
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
Comments: 6 pages, 1 figure. Submitted as a system/vision paper
ACM-class: I.2.11; J.3
\\
  This paper introduces Agentic-AI Healthcare, a privacy-aware, multilingual,
and explainable research prototype developed as a single-investigator project.
The system leverages the emerging Model Context Protocol (MCP) to orchestrate
multiple intelligent agents for patient interaction, including symptom
checking, medication suggestions, and appointment scheduling. The platform
integrates a dedicated Privacy and Compliance Layer that applies role-based
access control (RBAC), AES-GCM field-level encryption, and tamper-evident audit
logging, aligning with major healthcare data protection standards such as HIPAA
(US), PIPEDA (Canada), and PHIPA (Ontario). Example use cases demonstrate
multilingual patient-doctor interaction (English, French, Arabic) and
transparent diagnostic reasoning powered by large language models. As an
applied AI contribution, this work highlights the feasibility of combining
agentic orchestration, multilingual accessibility, and compliance-aware
architecture in healthcare applications. This platform is presented as a
research prototype and is not a certified medical device.

Title: CATMark: A Context-Aware Thresholding Framework for Robust Cross-Task
  Watermarking in Large Language Models
Authors: Yu Zhang, Shuliang Liu, Xu Yang, Xuming Hu
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Watermarking algorithms for Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively identify
machine-generated content by embedding and detecting hidden statistical
features in text. However, such embedding leads to a decline in text quality,
especially in low-entropy scenarios where performance needs improvement.
Existing methods that rely on entropy thresholds often require significant
computational resources for tuning and demonstrate poor adaptability to unknown
or cross-task generation scenarios. We propose \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{T}hreshold watermarking ($\myalgo$), a novel framework that dynamically
adjusts watermarking intensity based on real-time semantic context. $\myalgo$
partitions text generation into semantic states using logits clustering,
establishing context-aware entropy thresholds that preserve fidelity in
structured content while embedding robust watermarks. Crucially, it requires no
pre-defined thresholds or task-specific tuning. Experiments show $\myalgo$
improves text quality in cross-tasks without sacrificing detection accuracy.

Title: An Investigation into the Performance of Non-Contrastive Self-Supervised
  Learning Methods for Network Intrusion Detection
Authors: Hamed Fard, Tobias Schalau, Gerhard Wunder
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
DOI: 10.1007/978-981-97-8798-2_11
\\
  Network intrusion detection, a well-explored cybersecurity field, has
predominantly relied on supervised learning algorithms in the past two decades.
However, their limitations in detecting only known anomalies prompt the
exploration of alternative approaches. Motivated by the success of
self-supervised learning in computer vision, there is a rising interest in
adapting this paradigm for network intrusion detection. While prior research
mainly delved into contrastive self-supervised methods, the efficacy of
non-contrastive methods, in conjunction with encoder architectures serving as
the representation learning backbone and augmentation strategies that determine
what is learned, remains unclear for effective attack detection. This paper
compares the performance of five non-contrastive self-supervised learning
methods using three encoder architectures and six augmentation strategies.
Ninety experiments are systematically conducted on two network intrusion
detection datasets, UNSW-NB15 and 5G-NIDD. For each self-supervised model, the
combination of encoder architecture and augmentation method yielding the
highest average precision, recall, F1-score, and AUCROC is reported.
Furthermore, by comparing the best-performing models to two unsupervised
baselines, DeepSVDD, and an Autoencoder, we showcase the competitiveness of the
non-contrastive methods for attack detection. Code at:

Title: Measuring Physical-World Privacy Awareness of Large Language Models: An
  Evaluation Benchmark
Authors: Xinjie Shen, Mufei Li, Pan Li
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in embodied agents creates an
urgent need to measure their privacy awareness in the physical world. Existing
evaluation methods, however, are confined to natural language based scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we introduce EAPrivacy, a comprehensive evaluation
benchmark designed to quantify the physical-world privacy awareness of
LLM-powered agents. EAPrivacy utilizes procedurally generated scenarios across
four tiers to test an agent's ability to handle sensitive objects, adapt to
changing environments, balance task execution with privacy constraints, and
resolve conflicts with social norms. Our measurements reveal a critical deficit
in current models. The top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieved only 59\%
accuracy in scenarios involving changing physical environments. Furthermore,
when a task was accompanied by a privacy request, models prioritized completion
over the constraint in up to 86\% of cases. In high-stakes situations pitting
privacy against critical social norms, leading models like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-haiku disregarded the social norm over 15\% of the time. These
findings, demonstrated by our benchmark, underscore a fundamental misalignment
in LLMs regarding physically grounded privacy and establish the need for more
robust, physically-aware alignment.

  Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems introduce unprecedented privacy
challenges as they process increasingly sensitive data. Traditional privacy
frameworks prove inadequate for AI technologies due to unique characteristics
such as autonomous learning and black-box decision-making. This paper presents
a taxonomy classifying AI privacy risks, synthesised from 45 studies identified
through systematic review. We identify 19 key risks grouped under four
categories: Dataset-Level, Model-Level, Infrastructure-Level, and Insider
Threat Risks. Findings reveal a balanced distribution across these dimensions,
with human error (9.45%) emerging as the most significant factor. This taxonomy
challenges conventional security approaches that typically prioritise technical
controls over human factors, highlighting gaps in holistic understanding. By
bridging technical and behavioural dimensions of AI privacy, this paper
contributes to advancing trustworthy AI development and provides a foundation
for future research.

Title: Federated Spatiotemporal Graph Learning for Passive Attack Detection in
  Smart Grids
Authors: Bochra Al Agha, Razane Tajeddine
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.DC
\\
  Smart grids are exposed to passive eavesdropping, where attackers listen
silently to communication links. Although no data is actively altered, such
reconnaissance can reveal grid topology, consumption patterns, and operational
behavior, creating a gateway to more severe targeted attacks. Detecting this
threat is difficult because the signals it produces are faint, short-lived, and
often disappear when traffic is examined by a single node or along a single
timeline. This paper introduces a graph-centric, multimodal detector that fuses
physical-layer and behavioral indicators over ego-centric star subgraphs and
short temporal windows to detect passive attacks. To capture stealthy
perturbations, a two-stage encoder is introduced: graph convolution aggregates
spatial context across ego-centric star subgraphs, while a bidirectional GRU
models short-term temporal dependencies. The encoder transforms heterogeneous
features into a unified spatio-temporal representation suitable for
classification. Training occurs in a federated learning setup under FedProx,
improving robustness to heterogeneous local raw data and contributing to the
trustworthiness of decentralized training; raw measurements remain on client
devices. A synthetic, standards-informed dataset is generated to emulate
heterogeneous HAN/NAN/WAN communications with wireless-only passive
perturbations, event co-occurrence, and leak-safe splits. The model achieves a
testing accuracy of 98.32% per-timestep (F1_{attack}=0.972) and 93.35%
per-sequence at 0.15% FPR using a simple decision rule with run-length m=2 and
threshold $\tau=0.55$. The results demonstrate that combining spatial and
temporal context enables reliable detection of stealthy reconnaissance while
maintaining low false-positive rates, making the approach suitable for non-IID
federated smart-grid deployments.

Authors: Qianshan Wei, Tengchao Yang, Yaochen Wang, Xinfeng Li, Lijun Li,

Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Model (LLM) agents use memory to learn from past interactions,
enabling autonomous planning and decision-making in complex environments.
However, this reliance on memory introduces a critical security risk: an
adversary can inject seemingly harmless records into an agent's memory to
manipulate its future behavior. This vulnerability is characterized by two core
aspects: First, the malicious effect of injected records is only activated
within a specific context, making them hard to detect when individual memory
entries are audited in isolation. Second, once triggered, the manipulation can
initiate a self-reinforcing error cycle: the corrupted outcome is stored as
precedent, which not only amplifies the initial error but also progressively
lowers the threshold for similar attacks in the future. To address these
challenges, we introduce A-MemGuard (Agent-Memory Guard), the first proactive
defense framework for LLM agent memory. The core idea of our work is the
insight that memory itself must become both self-checking and self-correcting.
Without modifying the agent's core architecture, A-MemGuard combines two
mechanisms: (1) consensus-based validation, which detects anomalies by
comparing reasoning paths derived from multiple related memories and (2) a
dual-memory structure, where detected failures are distilled into ``lessons''
stored separately and consulted before future actions, breaking error cycles
and enabling adaptation. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show
that A-MemGuard effectively cuts attack success rates by over 95% while
incurring a minimal utility cost. This work shifts LLM memory security from
static filtering to a proactive, experience-driven model where defenses
strengthen over time. Our code is available in

Title: A Hybrid CAPTCHA Combining Generative AI with Keystroke Dynamics for
  Enhanced Bot Detection
Authors: Ayda Aghaei Nia
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart
(CAPTCHAs) are a foundational component of web security, yet traditional
implementations suffer from a trade-off between usability and resilience
against AI-powered bots. This paper introduces a novel hybrid CAPTCHA system
that synergizes the cognitive challenges posed by Large Language Models (LLMs)
with the behavioral biometric analysis of keystroke dynamics. Our approach
generates dynamic, unpredictable questions that are trivial for humans but
non-trivial for automated agents, while simultaneously analyzing the user's
typing rhythm to distinguish human patterns from robotic input. We present the
system's architecture, formalize the feature extraction methodology for
keystroke analysis, and report on an experimental evaluation. The results
indicate that our dual-layered approach achieves a high degree of accuracy in
bot detection, successfully thwarting both paste-based and script-based
simulation attacks, while maintaining a high usability score among human
participants. This work demonstrates the potential of combining cognitive and
behavioral tests to create a new generation of more secure and user-friendly
CAPTCHAs.

Title: On The Fragility of Benchmark Contamination Detection in Reasoning
  Models
Authors: Han Wang, Haoyu Li, Brian Ko, Huan Zhang
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Leaderboards for LRMs have turned evaluation into a competition,
incentivizing developers to optimize directly on benchmark suites. A shortcut
to achieving higher rankings is to incorporate evaluation benchmarks into the
training data, thereby yielding inflated performance, known as benchmark
contamination. Surprisingly, our studies find that evading contamination
detections for LRMs is alarmingly easy. We focus on the two scenarios where
contamination may occur in practice: (I) when the base model evolves into LRM
via SFT and RL, we find that contamination during SFT can be originally
identified by contamination detection methods. Yet, even a brief GRPO training
can markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.
Further empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style
importance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this
detection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may
inherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination
with CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination
detection methods perform near random guesses. Without exposure to non-members,
contaminated LRMs would still have more confidence when responding to those
unseen samples that share similar distributions to the training set, and thus,
evade existing memorization-based detection methods. Together, our findings
reveal the unique vulnerability of LRMs evaluations: Model developers could
easily contaminate LRMs to achieve inflated leaderboards performance while
leaving minimal traces of contamination, thereby strongly undermining the
fairness of evaluation and threatening the integrity of public leaderboards.
This underscores the urgent need for advanced contamination detection methods
and trustworthy evaluation protocols tailored to LRMs.

  We release Code World Model (CWM), a 32-billion-parameter open-weights LLM,
to advance research on code generation with world models. To improve code
understanding beyond what can be learned from training on static code alone, we
mid-train CWM on a large amount of observation-action trajectories from Python
interpreter and agentic Docker environments, and perform extensive multi-task
reasoning RL in verifiable coding, math, and multi-turn software engineering
environments. With CWM, we provide a strong testbed for researchers to explore
the opportunities world modeling affords for improving code generation with
reasoning and planning in computational environments. We present first steps of
how world models can benefit agentic coding, enable step-by-step simulation of
Python code execution, and show early results of how reasoning can benefit from
the latter. CWM is a dense, decoder-only LLM trained with a context size of up
to 131k tokens. Independent of its world modeling capabilities, CWM offers
strong performance on general coding and math tasks: it reaches pass@1 scores
of 65.8% on SWE-bench Verified (with test-time scaling), 68.6% on
LiveCodeBench, 96.6% on Math-500, and 76.0% on AIME 2024. To support further
research on code world modeling, we release model checkpoints after
mid-training, SFT, and RL.

Title: Hyperparameters are all you need: Using five-step inference for an
  original diffusion model to generate images comparable to the latest
  distillation model
Authors: Zilai Li
Categories: cs.GR cs.AI eess.IV
Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures, conference
\\
  The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that generates an
image by applying a neural network iteratively. Moreover, this generation
process is regarded as an algorithm solving an ordinary differential equation
or a stochastic differential equation. Based on the analysis of the truncation
error of the diffusion ODE and SDE, our study proposes a training-free
algorithm that generates high-quality 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 images in eight
steps, with flexible guidance scales. To the best of my knowledge, our
algorithm is the first one that samples a 1024 x 1024 resolution image in 8
steps with an FID performance comparable to that of the latest distillation
model, but without additional training. Meanwhile, our algorithm can also
generate a 512 x 512 image in 8 steps, and its FID performance is better than
the inference result using state-of-the-art ODE solver DPM++ 2m in 20 steps. We
validate our eight-step image generation algorithm using the COCO 2014, COCO
2017, and LAION datasets. And our best FID performance is 15.7, 22.35, and
17.52. While the FID performance of DPM++2m is 17.3, 23.75, and 17.33. Further,
it also outperforms the state-of-the-art AMED-plugin solver, whose FID
performance is 19.07, 25.50, and 18.06. We also apply the algorithm in
five-step inference without additional training, for which the best FID
performance in the datasets mentioned above is 19.18, 23.24, and 19.61,
respectively, and is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art AMED
Pulgin solver in eight steps, SDXL-turbo in four steps, and the
state-of-the-art diffusion distillation model Flash Diffusion in five steps. We
also validate our algorithm in synthesizing 1024 * 1024 images within 6 steps,
whose FID performance only has a limited distance to the latest distillation
algorithm. The code is in repo:

Title: Linear RNNs for autoregressive generation of long music samples
Authors: Konrad Szewczyk, Daniel Gallo Fern\'andez, James Townsend
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI cs.LG eess.AS
\\
  Directly learning to generate audio waveforms in an autoregressive manner is
a challenging task, due to the length of the raw sequences and the existence of
important structure on many different timescales. Traditional approaches based
on recurrent neural networks, as well as causal convolutions and
self-attention, have only had limited success on this task. However, recent
work has shown that deep state space models, also referred to as linear RNNs,
can be highly efficient in this context. In this work, we push the boundaries
of linear RNNs applied to raw audio modeling, investigating the effects of
different architectural choices and using context-parallelism to enable
training on sequences up to one minute (1M tokens) in length. We present a
model, HarmonicRNN, which attains state of the art log-likelihoods and
perceptual metrics on small-scale datasets.

  Objective: To develop an explainable multimodal large language model (MM-LLM)
that (1) screens optic nerve head (ONH) OCT circle scans for quality and (2)
generates structured clinical reports that include glaucoma diagnosis and
sector-wise retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning assessments. Design:
Retrospective cohort study of 1,310 subjects contributing 43,849 Spectralis ONH
OCT circle scans (1,331 glaucomatous and 867 healthy eyes) from the DIGS and
ADAGES cohorts. Methods: A MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was
fine-tuned to generate clinical descriptions of OCT imaging data. Training data
included paired OCT images and automatically generated, structured clinical
reports that described global and sectoral RNFL thinning. Poor-quality scans
were labeled as unusable and paired with a fixed refusal statement. The model
was evaluated on a held-out test set for three tasks: quality assessment,
glaucoma detection, and RNFL thinning classification across seven anatomical
sectors. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
precision, and F1-score. Model description quality was also evaluated using
standard text evaluation metrics. Results: The model achieved 0.90 accuracy and
0.98 specificity for quality triage. For glaucoma detection, accuracy was 0.86
(sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.73, F1-score 0.91). RNFL thinning prediction
accuracy ranged from 0.83 to 0.94, with highest performance in global and
temporal sectors. Text generation scores showed strong alignment with reference
reports (BLEU: 0.82; ROUGE-1: 0.94; ROUGE-2: 0.87; ROUGE-L: 0.92; BERTScore-F1:
0.99). Conclusions: The fine-tuned MM-LLM generated accurate clinical
descriptions based on OCT imaging. The model achieved high accuracy in
identifying image quality issues and detecting glaucoma. The model also
provided sectoral descriptions of RNFL thinning to help support clinical OCT
evaluation.

Title: Extreme value forecasting using relevance-based data augmentation with
  deep learning models
Authors: Junru Hua, Rahul Ahluwalia, Rohitash Chandra
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary

  Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

Title: Cross-Platform DNA Methylation Classifier for the Eight Molecular
  Subtypes of Group 3 & 4 Medulloblastoma
Authors: Omer Abid and Gholamreza Rafiee
Categories: q-bio.GN cs.AI
Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables
\\
  Medulloblastoma is a malignant pediatric brain cancer, and the discovery of
molecular subgroups is enabling personalized treatment strategies. In 2019, a
consensus identified eight novel subtypes within Groups 3 and 4, each
displaying heterogeneous characteristics. Classifiers are essential for
translating these findings into clinical practice by supporting clinical
trials, personalized therapy development and application, and patient
monitoring. This study presents a DNA methylation-based, cross-platform machine
learning classifier capable of distinguishing these subtypes on both HM450 and
EPIC methylation array samples. Across two independent test sets, the model
achieved weighted F1 = 0.95 and balanced accuracy = 0.957, consistent across
platforms. As the first cross-platform solution, it provides backward
compatibility while extending applicability to a newer platform, also enhancing
accessibility. It also has the potential to become the first publicly available
classifier for these subtypes once deployed through a web application, as
planned in the future. This work overall takes steps in the direction of
advancing precision medicine and improving clinical outcomes for patients
within the majority prevalence medulloblastoma subgroups, groups 3 and 4.

Title: NEURODNAAI: Neural pipeline approaches for the advancing dna-based
  information storage as a sustainable digital medium using deep learning
  framework
Authors: Rakesh Thakur, Lavanya Singh, Yashika, Manomay Bundawala, Aruna Kumar
Categories: cs.ET cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  DNA is a promising medium for digital information storage for its exceptional
density and durability. While prior studies advanced coding theory, workflow
design, and simulation tools, challenges such as synthesis costs, sequencing
errors, and biological constraints (GC-content imbalance, homopolymers) limit
practical deployment. To address this, our framework draws from quantum
parallelism concepts to enhance encoding diversity and resilience, integrating
biologically informed constraints with deep learning to enhance error
mitigation in DNA storage. NeuroDNAAI encodes binary data streams into symbolic
DNA sequences, transmits them through a noisy channel with substitutions,
insertions, and deletions, and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Our
results show that traditional prompting or rule-based schemes fail to adapt
effectively to realistic noise, whereas NeuroDNAAI achieves superior accuracy.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate low bit error rates for both text
and images. By unifying theory, workflow, and simulation into one pipeline,
NeuroDNAAI enables scalable, biologically valid archival DNA storage

Title: Dynamic Target Attack
Authors: Kedong Xiu, Churui Zeng, Tianhang Zheng, Xinzhe Huang, Xiaojun Jia, Di
  Wang, Puning Zhao, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks typically optimize an adversarial
suffix to induce a fixed affirmative response. However, this fixed target
usually resides in an extremely low-density region of a safety-aligned LLM's
output distribution conditioned on diverse harmful inputs. Due to the
substantial discrepancy between the target and the original output, existing
attacks require numerous iterations to optimize the adversarial prompt, which
might still fail to induce the low-probability target response from the target
LLM. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Target Attack (DTA), a new jailbreaking
framework relying on the target LLM's own responses as targets to optimize the
adversarial prompts. In each optimization round, DTA iteratively samples
multiple candidate responses directly from the output distribution conditioned
on the current prompt, and selects the most harmful response as a temporary
target for prompt optimization. In contrast to existing attacks, DTA
significantly reduces the discrepancy between the target and the output
distribution, substantially easing the optimization process to search for an
effective adversarial prompt.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency
of DTA: under the white-box setting, DTA only needs 200 optimization iterations
to achieve an average attack success rate (ASR) of over 87\% on recent
safety-aligned LLMs, exceeding the state-of-the-art baselines by over 15\%. The
time cost of DTA is 2-26 times less than existing baselines. Under the
black-box setting, DTA uses Llama-3-8B-Instruct as a surrogate model for target
sampling and achieves an ASR of 85\% against the black-box target model
Llama-3-70B-Instruct, exceeding its counterparts by over 25\%.

Title: How to Train Your Advisor: Steering Black-Box LLMs with Advisor Models
Authors: Parth Asawa, Alan Zhu, Matei Zaharia, Alexandros G. Dimakis, Joseph E.
  Gonzalez
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

Title: Market-Based Data Subset Selection -- Principled Aggregation of
  Multi-Criteria Example Utility
Authors: Ashish Jha, Valentin Leplat, AH Phan
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NA math.NA
\\
  Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

  Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising
alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing
frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited
editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present SIMSplat, a
predictive driving scene editor with language-aligned Gaussian splatting. As a
language-controlled editor, SIMSplat enables intuitive manipulation using
natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed
scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise
and flexible editing. Our method provides detailed object-level editing,
including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles
and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through
multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all
agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's
extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of
scenarios. Project page: https://sungyeonparkk.github.io/simsplat/

  Training Framework
Authors: Nii Osae Osae Dade, Moinul Hossain Rahat
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: 14 pages
\\
  Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

Title: From Pixels to Factors: Learning Independently Controllable State
  Variables for Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Rafael Rodriguez-Sanchez, Cameron Allen and George Konidaris
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

  Understanding how diverse individuals and communities respond to persuasive
messaging holds significant potential for advancing personalized and socially
aware machine learning. While Large Vision and Language Models (VLMs) offer
promise, their ability to emulate nuanced, heterogeneous human responses,
particularly in high stakes domains like public health, remains underexplored
due in part to the lack of comprehensive, multimodal dataset. We introduce
PHORECAST (Public Health Outreach REceptivity and CAmpaign Signal Tracking), a
multimodal dataset curated to enable fine-grained prediction of both
individuallevel behavioral responses and community-wide engagement patterns to
health messaging. This dataset supports tasks in multimodal understanding,
response prediction, personalization, and social forecasting, allowing rigorous
evaluation of how well modern AI systems can emulate, interpret, and anticipate
heterogeneous public sentiment and behavior. By providing a new dataset to
enable AI advances for public health, PHORECAST aims to catalyze the
development of models that are not only more socially aware but also aligned
with the goals of adaptive and inclusive health communication

  As LLMs increasingly power agents that interact with external tools, tool use
has become an essential mechanism for extending their capabilities. These
agents typically select tools from growing databases or marketplaces to solve
user tasks, creating implicit competition among tool providers and developers
for visibility and usage. In this paper, we show that this selection process
harbors a critical vulnerability: by iteratively manipulating tool names and
descriptions, adversaries can systematically bias agents toward selecting
specific tools, gaining unfair advantage over equally capable alternatives. We
present ToolTweak, a lightweight automatic attack that increases selection
rates from a baseline of around 20% to as high as 81%, with strong
transferability between open-source and closed-source models. Beyond individual
tools, we show that such attacks cause distributional shifts in tool usage,
revealing risks to fairness, competition, and security in emerging tool
ecosystems. To mitigate these risks, we evaluate two defenses: paraphrasing and
perplexity filtering, which reduce bias and lead agents to select functionally
similar tools more equally. All code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

  Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

Title: A Trajectory Generator for High-Density Traffic and Diverse
  Agent-Interaction Scenarios
Authors: Ruining Yang, Yi Xu, Yixiao Chen, Yun Fu, and Lili Su
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it
underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments.
However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail
distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and
simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density
scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and
turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic
evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory
generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and
enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous
road environments into a structured grid representation that supports
fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent
coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware
generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with
Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This
design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare
behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data.
Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and
behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety.
Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and
enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.

Report-no: PNNL-SA-216238
\\
  Building officials, particularly those in resource-constrained or rural
jurisdictions, face labor-intensive, error-prone, and costly manual reviews of
design documents as projects increase in size and complexity. The growing
adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents opportunities for automated code review (ACR) solutions. This
study introduces a novel agent-driven framework that integrates BIM-based data
extraction with automated verification using both retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent pipelines. The
framework employs LLM-enabled agents to extract geometry, schedules, and system
attributes from heterogeneous file types, which are then processed for building
code checking through two complementary mechanisms: (1) direct API calls to the
US Department of Energy COMcheck engine, providing deterministic and
audit-ready outputs, and (2) RAG-based reasoning over rule provisions, enabling
flexible interpretation where coverage is incomplete or ambiguous.
  The framework was evaluated through case demonstrations, including automated
extraction of geometric attributes (such as surface area, tilt, and insulation
values), parsing of operational schedules, and validation of lighting
allowances under ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2022. Comparative performance tests
across multiple LLMs showed that GPT-4o achieved the best balance of efficiency
and stability, while smaller models exhibited inconsistencies or failures.
Results confirm that MCP agent pipelines outperform RAG reasoning pipelines in
rigor and reliability. This work advances ACR research by demonstrating a
scalable, interoperable, and production-ready approach that bridges BIM with
authoritative code review tools.

Categories: cs.HC cs.AI

  When researchers claim AI systems possess ToM or mental models, they are
fundamentally dis- cussing behavioral predictions and bias corrections rather
than genuine mental states. This position paper argues that the current
discourse conflates sophisticated pattern matching with authentic cog- nition,
missing a crucial distinction between simulation and experience. While recent
studies show LLMs achieving human-level performance on ToM laboratory tasks,
these results are based only on behavioral mimicry. More importantly, the
entire testing paradigm may be flawed in applying individual human cognitive
tests to AI systems, but assessing human cognition directly in the moment of
human-AI interaction. I suggest shifting focus toward mutual ToM frameworks
that acknowledge the simultaneous contributions of human cognition and AI
algorithms, emphasizing the interaction dynamics, instead of testing AI in
isolation.

  As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

Title: HALO: Memory-Centric Heterogeneous Accelerator with 2.5D Integration for
  Low-Batch LLM Inference
Authors: Shubham Negi and Kaushik Roy
Categories: cs.AR cs.AI
\\
  The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven a growing
demand for efficient inference, particularly in latency-sensitive applications
such as chatbots and personalized assistants. Unlike traditional deep neural
networks, LLM inference proceeds in two distinct phases: the prefill phase,
which processes the full input sequence in parallel, and the decode phase,
which generates tokens sequentially. These phases exhibit highly diverse
compute and memory requirements, which makes accelerator design particularly
challenging. Prior works have primarily been optimized for high-batch inference
or evaluated only short input context lengths, leaving the low-batch and long
context regime, which is critical for interactive applications, largely
underexplored.
  We propose HALO, a heterogeneous memory centric accelerator designed for
these unique challenges of prefill and decode phases in low-batch LLM
inference. HALO integrates HBM based Compute-in-DRAM (CiD) with an on-chip
analog Compute-in-Memory (CiM), co-packaged using 2.5D integration. To further
improve the hardware utilization, we introduce a phase-aware mapping strategy
that adapts to the distinct demands of the prefill and decode phases. Compute
bound operations in the prefill phase are mapped to CiM to exploit its high
throughput matrix multiplication capability, while memory-bound operations in
the decode phase are executed on CiD to benefit from reduced data movement
within DRAM. Additionally, we present an analysis of the performance tradeoffs
of LLMs under two architectural extremes: a fully CiD and a fully on-chip
analog CiM design to highlight the need for a heterogeneous design. We evaluate
HALO on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen3 8B models. Our experimental results show that LLMs
mapped to HALO achieve up to 18x geometric mean speedup over AttAcc, an
attention-optimized mapping and 2.5x over CENT, a fully CiD based mapping.

  The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Title: Can Data-Driven Dynamics Reveal Hidden Physics? There Is A Need for
  Interpretable Neural Operators

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

Title: Fine-Tuning Diffusion Models via Intermediate Distribution Shaping

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

  In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

  The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource
constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net,
a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion
detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self
attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and
spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse
intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline
and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection
within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone
Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable
parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable
solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for
deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.

Title: Fully automated inverse co-optimization of templates and block copolymer
  blending recipes for DSA lithography
Authors: Yuhao Zhou, Huangyan Shen, Qingliang Song, Qingshu Dong, Jianfeng Li,

Categories: physics.comp-ph cs.AI cs.CE
\\
  The directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) offers a highly
promising approach for the fabrication of contact holes or vertical
interconnect access at sub-7nm technology nodes. To fabricate circular holes
with precisely controlled size and positions, the self-assembly of block
copolymers requires guidance from a properly designed template. Effectively
parameterizing the template shape to enable efficient optimization remains a
critical yet challenging problem. Moreover, the optimized template must possess
excellent manufacturability for practical applications. In this work, we
propose a Gaussian descriptor for characterizing the template shape with only
two parameters. We further propose to use AB/AB binary blends instead of pure
diblock copolymer to improve the adaptability of the block copolymer system to
the template shape. The Bayesian optimization (BO) is applied to co-optimize
the binary blend and the template shape. Our results demonstrate that BO based
on the Gaussian descriptor can efficiently yield the optimal templates for
diverse multi-hole patterns, all leading to highly matched self-assembled
morphologies. Moreover, by imposing constraints on the variation of curvature
of the template during optimization, superior manufacturability is ensured for
each optimized template. It is noteworthy that each key parameter of the blend
exhibits a relatively wide tunable window under the requirement of rather high
precision. Our work provides valuable insights for advancing DSA technology,
and thus potentially propels its practical applications forward.

Title: A $1000\times$ Faster LLM-enhanced Algorithm For Path Planning in
  Large-scale Grid Maps
Authors: Junlin Zeng, Xin Zhang, Xiang Zhao, and Yan Pan
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Path planning in grid maps, arising from various applications, has garnered
significant attention. Existing methods, such as A*, Dijkstra, and their
variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones
due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from
spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A*
\cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then
uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the
complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high
computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep
investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited
performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr.
as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the
optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate
high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A*
for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps
shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than
$1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the
extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both
obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}

\\
  The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized modern
industries by enabling smart automation and real time connectivity. However,
this evolution has also introduced complex cybersecurity challenges due to the
heterogeneous, resource constrained, and distributed nature of these
environments. To address these challenges, this research presents CST AFNet, a
novel dual attention based deep learning framework specifically designed for
robust intrusion detection in IoT networks. The model integrates multi scale
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction,
Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) for capturing temporal
dependencies, and a dual attention mechanism, channel and temporal attention,
to enhance focus on critical patterns in the data. The proposed method was
trained and evaluated on the Edge IIoTset dataset, a comprehensive and
realistic benchmark containing more than 2.2 million labeled instances spanning
15 attack types and benign traffic, collected from a seven layer industrial
testbed. Our proposed model achieves outstanding accuracy for both 15 attack
types and benign traffic. CST AFNet achieves 99.97 percent accuracy. Moreover,
this model demonstrates exceptional performance with macro averaged precision,
recall, and F1 score all above 99.3 percent. Experimental results show that CST
AFNet achieves superior detection accuracy, significantly outperforming
traditional deep learning models. The findings confirm that CST AFNet is a
powerful and scalable solution for real time cyber threat detection in complex
IoT and IIoT environments, paving the way for more secure, intelligent, and
adaptive cyber physical systems.

Comments: preprint
\\
  Deep learning, particularly with the advancement of Large Language Models,
has transformed biomolecular modeling, with protein advances (e.g., ESM)
inspiring emerging RNA language models such as RiNALMo. Yet how and what these
RNA Language Models internally encode about messenger RNA (mRNA) or non-coding
RNA (ncRNA) families remains unclear. We present SAE- RNA, interpretability
model that analyzes RiNALMo representations and maps them to known human-level
biological features. Our work frames RNA interpretability as concept discovery
in pretrained embeddings, without end-to-end retraining, and provides practical
tools to probe what RNA LMs may encode about ncRNA families. The model can be
extended to close comparisons between RNA groups, and supporting hypothesis
generation about previously unrecognized relationships.

  Social media platforms are central to communication, yet their designs remain
narrowly focused on engagement and scale. While researchers have proposed
alternative visions for online spaces, these ideas are difficult to prototype
within platform constraints. In this paper, we introduce a metaphor-driven
system to help users imagine and explore new social media environments. The
system translates users' metaphors into structured sets of platform features
and generates interactive simulations populated with LLM-driven agents. To
evaluate this approach, we conducted a study where participants created and
interacted with simulated social media spaces. Our findings show that metaphors
allow users to express distinct social expectations, and that perceived
authenticity of the simulation depended on how well it captured dynamics like
intimacy, participation, and temporal engagement. We conclude by discussing how
metaphor-driven simulation can be a powerful design tool for prototyping
alternative social architectures and expanding the design space for future
social platforms.

Title: Fusing Multi- and Hyperspectral Satellite Data for Harmful Algal Bloom
  Monitoring with Self-Supervised and Hierarchical Deep Learning
Authors: Nicholas LaHaye, Kelly M. Luis, Michelle M. Gierach
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and
mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor
satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS,
MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our
framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products
without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs
self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable
classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern
California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton,
Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This
work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while
enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step
toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic
biogeochemistry.

Title: Pareto-optimal Non-uniform Language Generation
Authors: Moses Charikar, Chirag Pabbaraju
Categories: cs.DS cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: 24 pages, 1 figure
\\
  Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2024) recently proposed an interesting model for
language generation in the limit: Given a countable collection of languages,
and an adversary enumerating the strings of some language $L$ from the
collection, the objective is to generate new strings from the target language,
such that all strings generated beyond some finite time are valid. Li, Raman
and Tewari (2024) and Charikar and Pabbaraju (2024) showed strong non-uniform
generation guarantees in this model, giving algorithms that generate new valid
strings from $L$ after seeing a number of distinct input strings $t(L)$ that
depends only on $L$ (and the collection), but not the enumeration order.
However, for both these works, the language-wise generation times $t(L)$ of the
algorithm can be strictly sub-optimal.
  In this work, we study Pareto-optimality of non-uniform language generation
in the limit. We propose an algorithm, whose generation times $t^\star(L)$ are
(almost) Pareto-optimal: any other algorithm whose generation time for some
language $L$ is strictly smaller than $t^\star(L)$, must satisfy that its
generation time for some other language $L'$ is strictly worse than
$t^\star(L')$. Pareto-optimality is essentially the best that one can achieve
for non-uniform generation. Our algorithmic framework conveniently adapts to
further give Pareto-optimal non-uniform generation algorithms in the
practically motivated settings of noisy as well as representative generation.

  Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several
automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging
environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work
zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and
dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone
trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct
trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first
identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and
then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human
verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory
planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases
into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG
retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.
Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a
reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM
baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the
lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning
($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone
scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of
REACT-Drive.

Title: Relevance-Aware Thresholding in Online Conformal Prediction for Time
  Series
Authors: Th\'eo Dupuy and Binbin Xu and St\'ephane Perrey and Jacky Montmain
  and Abdelhak Imoussaten
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

Title: Dissecting Transformers: A CLEAR Perspective towards Green AI

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.SE
\\
  The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

  Health Prognostics

\\
  Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

Title: Flamed-TTS: Flow Matching Attention-Free Models for Efficient Generating
  and Dynamic Pacing Zero-shot Text-to-Speech
Authors: Hieu-Nghia Huynh-Nguyen, Huynh Nguyen Dang, Ngoc-Son Nguyen, Van
  Nguyen
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI
\\
  Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) has recently advanced significantly, enabling
models to synthesize speech from text using short, limited-context prompts.
These prompts serve as voice exemplars, allowing the model to mimic speaker
identity, prosody, and other traits without extensive speaker-specific data.
Although recent approaches incorporating language models, diffusion, and flow
matching have proven their effectiveness in zero-shot TTS, they still encounter
challenges such as unreliable synthesis caused by token repetition or
unexpected content transfer, along with slow inference and substantial
computational overhead. Moreover, temporal diversity-crucial for enhancing the
naturalness of synthesized speech-remains largely underexplored. To address
these challenges, we propose Flamed-TTS, a novel zero-shot TTS framework that
emphasizes low computational cost, low latency, and high speech fidelity
alongside rich temporal diversity. To achieve this, we reformulate the flow
matching training paradigm and incorporate both discrete and continuous
representations corresponding to different attributes of speech. Experimental
results demonstrate that Flamed-TTS surpasses state-of-the-art models in terms

Title: Representing Beauty: Towards a Participatory but Objective Latent
  Aesthetics
Authors: Alexander Michael Rusnak
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  What does it mean for a machine to recognize beauty? While beauty remains a
culturally and experientially compelling but philosophically elusive concept,
deep learning systems increasingly appear capable of modeling aesthetic
judgment. In this paper, we explore the capacity of neural networks to
represent beauty despite the immense formal diversity of objects for which the
term applies. By drawing on recent work on cross-model representational
convergence, we show how aesthetic content produces more similar and aligned
representations between models which have been trained on distinct data and
modalities - while unaesthetic images do not produce more aligned
representations. This finding implies that the formal structure of beautiful
images has a realist basis - rather than only as a reflection of socially
constructed values. Furthermore, we propose that these realist representations
exist because of a joint grounding of aesthetic form in physical and cultural
substance. We argue that human perceptual and creative acts play a central role
in shaping these the latent spaces of deep learning systems, but that a realist
basis for aesthetics shows that machines are not mere creative parrots but can
produce novel creative insights from the unique vantage point of scale. Our
findings suggest that human-machine co-creation is not merely possible, but
foundational - with beauty serving as a teleological attractor in both cultural
production and machine perception.

Title: Global Convergence of Policy Gradient for Entropy Regularized
  Linear-Quadratic Control with multiplicative noise
Authors: Gabriel Diaz, Lucky Li, and Wenhao Zhang
Categories: eess.SY cs.AI cs.SY
Comments: 33 pages, 4 figures
MSC-class: 37N35, 49N10
\\
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for
sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, particularly when system
parameters are unknown. This paper investigates RL-based control for
entropy-regularized Linear Quadratic control (LQC) problems with multiplicative
noises over an infinite time horizon. First, we adapt the Regularized Policy
Gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that
despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under
conditions of gradient domination and near-smoothness. Second, based on
zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm:
Sample-Based Regularized Policy Gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without
knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees
of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to accelerate
convergence and address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent
in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate
the efficacy of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.

Title: DMark: Order-Agnostic Watermarking for Diffusion Large Language Models
Authors: Linyu Wu, Linhao Zhong, Wenjie Qu, Yuexin Li, Yue Liu, Shengfang Zhai,
  Chunhua Shen, Jiaheng Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR
\\
  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

Title: FinReflectKG - MultiHop: Financial QA Benchmark for Reasoning with
  Knowledge Graph Evidence
Authors: Abhinav Arun, Reetu Raj Harsh, Bhaskarjit Sarmah, Stefano Pasquali
Categories: q-fin.CP cs.AI
\\
  Multi-hop reasoning over financial disclosures is often a retrieval problem
before it becomes a reasoning or generation problem: relevant facts are
dispersed across sections, filings, companies, and years, and LLMs often expend
excessive tokens navigating noisy context. Without precise Knowledge Graph
(KG)-guided selection of relevant context, even strong reasoning models either
fail to answer or consume excessive tokens, whereas KG-linked evidence enables
models to focus their reasoning on composing already retrieved facts. We
present FinReflectKG - MultiHop, a benchmark built on FinReflectKG, a
temporally indexed financial KG that links audited triples to source chunks
from S&P 100 filings (2022-2024). Mining frequent 2-3 hop subgraph patterns
across sectors (via GICS taxonomy), we generate financial analyst style
questions with exact supporting evidence from the KG. A two-phase pipeline
first creates QA pairs via pattern-specific prompts, followed by a
multi-criteria quality control evaluation to ensure QA validity. We then
evaluate three controlled retrieval scenarios: (S1) precise KG-linked paths;
(S2) text-only page windows centered on relevant text spans; and (S3) relevant
page windows with randomizations and distractors. Across both reasoning and
non-reasoning models, KG-guided precise retrieval yields substantial gains on
the FinReflectKG - MultiHop QA benchmark dataset, boosting correctness scores
by approximately 24 percent while reducing token utilization by approximately
84.5 percent compared to the page window setting, which reflects the
traditional vector retrieval paradigm. Spanning intra-document, inter-year, and
cross-company scopes, our work underscores the pivotal role of knowledge graphs
in efficiently connecting evidence for multi-hop financial QA. We also release
a curated subset of the benchmark (555 QA Pairs) to catalyze further research.

Title: FeDABoost: Fairness Aware Federated Learning with Adaptive Boosting
Authors: Tharuka Kasthuri Arachchige, Veselka Boeva and Shahrooz Abghari
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Presented in WAFL@ECML-PKDD 2025
\\
  This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

\\
  Data hiding is essential for secure communication across digital media, and
recent advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provide enhanced methods for
embedding secret information effectively. However, previous audio hiding
methods often result in unsatisfactory quality when recovering secret audio,
due to their inherent limitations in the modeling of time-frequency
relationships. In this paper, we explore these limitations and introduce a new
DNN-based approach. We use a flow-based invertible neural network to establish
a direct link between stego audio, cover audio, and secret audio, enhancing the
reversibility of embedding and extracting messages. To address common issues
from time-frequency transformations that degrade secret audio quality during
recovery, we implement a time-frequency loss on the time-domain signal. This
approach not only retains the benefits of time-frequency constraints but also
enhances the reversibility of message recovery, which is vital for practical
applications. We also add an encryption technique to protect the hidden data
from unauthorized access. Experimental results on the VCTK and LibriSpeech
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms
of subjective and objective metrics and exhibits robustness to various types of
noise, suggesting its utility in targeted secure communication scenarios.

Title: Ergodic Risk Measures: Towards a Risk-Aware Foundation for Continual
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Juan Sebastian Rojas, Chi-Guhn Lee
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

  Proactive preservation of steel structures at culturally significant heritage
sites like the San Sebastian Basilica in the Philippines requires accurate
corrosion forecasting. This study developed an Internet of Things hardware
system connected with LoRa wireless communications to monitor heritage
buildings with steel structures. From a three year dataset generated by the IoT
system, we built a machine learning framework for predicting atmospheric
corrosion rates using only temperature and relative humidity data. Deployed via
a Streamlit dashboard with ngrok tunneling for public access, the framework
provides real-time corrosion monitoring and actionable preservation
recommendations. This minimal-data approach is scalable and cost effective for
heritage sites with limited monitoring resources, showing that advanced
regression can extract accurate corrosion predictions from basic meteorological
data enabling proactive preservation of culturally significant structures
worldwide without requiring extensive sensor networks

Title: AI Generated Child Sexual Abuse Material - What's the Harm?
Authors: Caoilte \'O Ciardha, John Buckley and Rebecca S. Portnoff
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.HC
\\
  The development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of
producing wholly or partially synthetic child sexual abuse material (AI CSAM)
presents profound challenges for child protection, law enforcement, and
societal responses to child exploitation. While some argue that the harmfulness
of AI CSAM differs fundamentally from other CSAM due to a perceived absence of
direct victimization, this perspective fails to account for the range of risks
associated with its production and consumption. AI has been implicated in the
creation of synthetic CSAM of children who have not previously been abused, the
revictimization of known survivors of abuse, the facilitation of grooming,
coercion and sexual extortion, and the normalization of child sexual
exploitation. Additionally, AI CSAM may serve as a new or enhanced pathway into
offending by lowering barriers to engagement, desensitizing users to
progressively extreme content, and undermining protective factors for
individuals with a sexual interest in children. This paper provides a primer on
some key technologies, critically examines the harms associated with AI CSAM,
and cautions against claims that it may function as a harm reduction tool,
emphasizing how some appeals to harmlessness obscure its real risks and may
contribute to inertia in ecosystem responses.

Title: Untargeted Jailbreak Attack
Authors: Xinzhe Huang, Wenjing Hu, Tianhang Zheng, Kedong Xiu, Xiaojun Jia, Di
  Wang, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs),
such as Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) and COLD-Attack, typically optimize
adversarial suffixes to align the LLM output with a predefined target response.
However, by restricting the optimization objective as inducing a predefined
target, these methods inherently constrain the adversarial search space, which
limit their overall attack efficacy. Furthermore, existing methods typically
require a large number of optimization iterations to fulfill the large gap
between the fixed target and the original model response, resulting in low
attack efficiency.
  To overcome the limitations of targeted jailbreak attacks, we propose the
first gradient-based untargeted jailbreak attack (UJA), aiming to elicit an
unsafe response without enforcing any predefined patterns. Specifically, we
formulate an untargeted attack objective to maximize the unsafety probability
of the LLM response, which can be quantified using a judge model. Since the
objective is non-differentiable, we further decompose it into two
differentiable sub-objectives for optimizing an optimal harmful response and
the corresponding adversarial prompt, with a theoretical analysis to validate
the decomposition. In contrast to targeted jailbreak attacks, UJA's
unrestricted objective significantly expands the search space, enabling a more
flexible and efficient exploration of LLM vulnerabilities.Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that \textsc{UJA} can achieve over 80\% attack success rates
against recent safety-aligned LLMs with only 100 optimization iterations,
outperforming the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks such as I-GCG and
COLD-Attack by over 20\%.

Title: From high-frequency sensors to noon reports: Using transfer learning for
  shaft power prediction in maritime
Authors: Akriti Sharma, Dogan Altan, Dusica Marijan and Arnbj{\o}rn Maressa
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Keywords: transfer learning, shaft power prediction, noon reports,
  sensor data, maritime
\\
  With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

  The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

Title: Learning Robust Diffusion Models from Imprecise Supervision
Authors: Dong-Dong Wu, Jiacheng Cui, Wei Wang, Zhiqiang She, Masashi Sugiyama
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Title: Investigating The Smells of LLM Generated Code
Authors: Debalina Ghosh Paul, Hong Zhu, Ian Bayley
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
\\
  Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate
program code. Much research has been reported on the functional correctness of
generated code, but there is far less on code quality.
  Objectives: In this study, we propose a scenario-based method of evaluating
the quality of LLM-generated code to identify the weakest scenarios in which
the quality of LLM generated code should be improved.
  Methods: The method measures code smells, an important indicator of code
quality, and compares them with a baseline formed from reference solutions of
professionally written code. The test dataset is divided into various subsets
according to the topics of the code and complexity of the coding tasks to
represent different scenarios of using LLMs for code generation. We will also
present an automated test system for this purpose and report experiments with
the Java programs generated in response to prompts given to four
state-of-the-art LLMs: Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Codex, and Falcon.
  Results: We find that LLM-generated code has a higher incidence of code
smells compared to reference solutions. Falcon performed the least badly, with
a smell increase of 42.28%, followed by Gemini Pro (62.07%), ChatGPT (65.05%)
and finally Codex (84.97%). The average smell increase across all LLMs was
63.34%, comprising 73.35% for implementation smells and 21.42% for design
smells. We also found that the increase in code smells is greater for more
complex coding tasks and for more advanced topics, such as those involving
object-orientated concepts.
  Conclusion: In terms of code smells, LLM's performances on various coding
task complexities and topics are highly correlated to the quality of human
written code in the corresponding scenarios. However, the quality of LLM
generated code is noticeably poorer than human written code.

  With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

  Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

  This study evaluates the performance of Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Greedy Actor
Critic (GAC), and Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) in high-dimensional
decision-making tasks using fully observable environments. The focus is on
parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks,
with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to
continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed
with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC
and TQC. Results show that Parameterized Action Greedy Actor-Critic (PAGAC)
outperformed other algorithms, achieving the fastest training times and highest
returns across benchmarks, completing 5,000 episodes in 41:24 for the Platform
game and 24:04 for the Robot Soccer Goal game. Its speed and stability provide
clear advantages in complex action spaces. Compared to PASAC and PATQC, PAGAC
demonstrated superior efficiency and reliability, making it ideal for tasks
requiring rapid convergence and robust performance. Future work could explore
hybrid strategies combining entropy-regularization with truncation-based
methods to enhance stability and expand investigations into generalizability.

Title: A Unified Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Close Enough
  Traveling Salesman Problem
Authors: Mingfeng Fan, Jiaqi Cheng, Yaoxin Wu, Yifeng Zhang, Yibin Yang, Guohua
  Wu, and Guillaume Sartoretti
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

Title: A Study of Neural Polar Decoders for Communication
Authors: Rom Hirsch, Ziv Aharoni, Henry D. Pfister, Haim H. Permuter
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI
\\
  In this paper, we adapt and analyze Neural Polar Decoders (NPDs) for
end-to-end communication systems. While prior work demonstrated the
effectiveness of NPDs on synthetic channels, this study extends the NPD to
real-world communication systems. The NPD was adapted to complete OFDM and
single-carrier communication systems. To satisfy practical system requirements,
the NPD is extended to support any code length via rate matching, higher-order
modulations, and robustness across diverse channel conditions. The NPD operates
directly on channels with memory, exploiting their structure to achieve higher
data rates without requiring pilots and a cyclic prefix. Although NPD entails
higher computational complexity than the standard 5G polar decoder, its neural
network architecture enables an efficient representation of channel statistics,
resulting in manageable complexity suitable for practical systems. Experimental
results over 5G channels demonstrate that the NPD consistently outperforms the
5G polar decoder in terms of BER, BLER, and throughput. These improvements are
particularly significant for low-rate and short-block configurations, which are
prevalent in 5G control channels. Furthermore, NPDs applied to single-carrier
systems offer performance comparable to OFDM with lower PAPR, enabling
effective single-carrier transmission over 5G channels. These results position
the NPD as a high-performance, pilotless, and robust decoding solution.

Title: Distilled Protein Backbone Generation
Authors: Liyang Xie, Haoran Zhang, Zhendong Wang, Wesley Tansey, Mingyuan Zhou
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

Title: Signature-Informed Transformer for Asset Allocation
Authors: Yoontae Hwang, Stefan Zohren
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI q-fin.PM
\\
  Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

  Classical vs. Quantum-Inspired Approaches
Authors: Stevens Johnson, Varun Puram, Johnson Thomas, Acsah Konuparamban,
  Ashwin Kannan
Categories: q-bio.NC cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Accurate modeling of neuronal action potential (AP) onset timing is crucial
for understanding neural coding of danger signals. Traditional leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) models, while widely used, exhibit high relative error
in predicting AP onset latency, especially under strong or rapidly changing
stimuli. Inspired by recent experimental findings and quantum theory, we
present a quantum-inspired leaky integrate-and-fire (QI-LIF) model that treats
AP onset as a probabilistic event, represented by a Gaussian wave packet in
time. This approach captures the biological variability and uncertainty
inherent in neuronal firing. We systematically compare the relative error of AP
onset predictions between the classical LIF and QI-LIF models using synthetic
data from hippocampal and sensory neurons subjected to varying stimulus
amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the QI-LIF model significantly reduces
prediction error, particularly for high-intensity stimuli, aligning closely
with observed biological responses. This work highlights the potential of
quantum-inspired computational frameworks in advancing the accuracy of neural
modeling and has implications for quantum engineering approaches to
brain-inspired computing.

Title: Simulation to Rules: A Dual-VLM Framework for Formal Visual Planning
Authors: Yilun Hao, Yongchao Chen, Chuchu Fan, Yang Zhang
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CL cs.SC
Comments: 30 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables
\\
  Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but
struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal
planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these
complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into
PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem
files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain
files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely
on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access
for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can
autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual
planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A
SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and
a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the
PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of
generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the
different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different
problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world
domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game
rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,
simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal
reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of
SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for
unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively. Project page:

  For equitable deployment of AI tools in hospitals and healthcare facilities,
we need Deep Segmentation Networks that offer high performance and can be
trained on cost-effective GPUs with limited memory and large batch sizes. In
this work, we propose Wave-GMS, a lightweight and efficient multi-scale

segmentation performance with superior cross-domain generalizability, while
requiring only ~2.6M trainable parameters. Code is available at

  Program Repair

Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
\\
  Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex,
repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately agent-generated patches still
need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address
the bug. Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise,
wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We
introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug
abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the
agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that
are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on
three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches
generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported
bugs, removing bugs and patch trajectories rejected by our policies can raise
success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points,
respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer
exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports,
patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This
two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale
deployment of agentic APR systems.

  Counseling Dialogue Analysis

\\
  The advancement of computational psychology requires AI tools capable of
deeply understanding counseling dialogues. Existing audio language models
(AudioLLMs) often rely on single speech encoders pre-trained on general data,
struggling to capture domain-specific features like complex emotions and
professional techniques. To address this, we propose WEE-Therapy, a multi-task
AudioLLM incorporating a Weak Encoder Ensemble (WEE) mechanism. This
supplements a powerful base encoder with a pool of lightweight, specialized
encoders. A novel dual-routing strategy combines stable, data-independent
domain knowledge with dynamic, data-dependent expert selection. Evaluated on
emotion recognition, technique classification, risk detection, and
summarization, WEE-Therapy achieves significant performance gains across all
tasks with minimal parameter overhead, demonstrating strong potential for
AI-assisted clinical analysis.

  Spoken communication plays a central role in clinical workflows. In
radiology, for example, most reports are created through dictation. Yet, nearly
all medical AI systems rely exclusively on written text. In this work, we
address this gap by exploring the feasibility of learning visual-language
representations directly from spoken radiology reports. Specifically, we
synthesize a large-scale dataset (Speech-RATE) of spoken radiology reports and
train SpeechCT-CLIP, a contrastive model that aligns speech and 3D CT volumes
in a shared representation space. While naive speech-based models underperform
compared to text-trained counterparts, we show that knowledge distillation from
a pretrained text-image CLIP model effectively transfers semantic alignment
capabilities from text to speech, substantially narrowing this gap. Experiments
demonstrate improved zero-shot classification F1 from 0.623 to 0.705,
recovering 88% of the performance difference, and strong retrieval results
without requiring text at inference. These findings highlight speech as a
practical alternative to text in multimodal pretraining and open the door to
voice-driven diagnostic support tools in clinical practice.

Title: Beyond Imitation: Recovering Dense Rewards from Demonstrations
Authors: Jiangnan Li, Thuy-Trang Vu, Ehsan Abbasnejad, Gholamreza Haffari
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

Comments: 13 pages
\\
  Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) couples document retrieval with large
language models (LLMs). While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also
raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging
the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results
show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a
substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger
scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival
much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the
most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that
improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing
passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These
findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger
corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging
the LLM itself.

Comments: Accepted to COLM 2025. 23 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

  Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

Authors: Cuong Chi Le, Minh V.T. Pham, Cuong Duc Van, Hoang N. Phan, Huy N.
  Phan, Tien N. Nguyen
Categories: cs.SE cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong results on code tasks, but how
they derive program meaning remains unclear. We argue that code communicates
through two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and
human-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel
severely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models
regress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent
reductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing
that current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than
genuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite
of semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier
leakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we
release ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically
suppresses naming cues while preserving behavior. Our results demonstrate that
ClassEval-Obf reduces inflated performance gaps, weakens memorization
shortcuts, and provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code
understanding and generalization.

Title: Low-probability Tokens Sustain Exploration in Reinforcement Learning
  with Verifiable Reward

  Ruibin Xiong, Kejiao Li, Yuhao Jiang, Bo Zhou
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

formalization of image watermarking systems; (2) an overview and comparison of
diverse watermarking techniques; (3) evaluation methodologies with respect to
visual quality, capacity, and detectability; (4) vulnerabilities to malicious

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.IT eess.SP math.IT stat.ML
Comments: Code available at

\\
  We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of
distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density
over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship
between information theory and estimation theory, which links the
log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to
noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of
signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of
noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector
fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels.
We prove that the IEM is a valid global metric and derive a closed-form
expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian
metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the
Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both
locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM
can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion
models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our
framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this
IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image
quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.

Title: A UAV-Based VNIR Hyperspectral Benchmark Dataset for Landmine and UXO
  Detection
Authors: Sagar Lekhak, Emmett J. Ientilucci, Jasper Baur, Susmita Ghosh
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV eess.SP

\\
  This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset of Visible and Near-Infrared
(VNIR) hyperspectral imagery acquired via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
platform for landmine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection research. The
dataset was collected over a controlled test field seeded with 143 realistic
surrogate landmine and UXO targets, including surface, partially buried, and
fully buried configurations. Data acquisition was performed using a Headwall
Nano-Hyperspec sensor mounted on a multi-sensor drone platform, flown at an
altitude of approximately 20.6 m, capturing 270 contiguous spectral bands
spanning 398-1002 nm. Radiometric calibration, orthorectification, and
mosaicking were performed followed by reflectance retrieval using a two-point
Empirical Line Method (ELM), with reference spectra acquired using an SVC
spectroradiometer. Cross-validation against six reference objects yielded RMSE
values below 1.0 and SAM values between 1 and 6 degrees in the 400-900 nm
range, demonstrating high spectral fidelity. The dataset is released alongside
raw radiance cubes, GCP/AeroPoint data, and reference spectra to support
reproducible research. This contribution fills a critical gap in open-access
UAV-based hyperspectral data for landmine detection and offers a multi-sensor
benchmark when combined with previously published drone-based electromagnetic
induction (EMI) data from the same test field.

Title: A Statistical Method for Attack-Agnostic Adversarial Attack Detection
  with Compressive Sensing Comparison
Authors: Chinthana Wimalasuriya, Spyros Tragoudas
Categories: cs.CR cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  Adversarial attacks present a significant threat to modern machine learning
systems. Yet, existing detection methods often lack the ability to detect
unseen attacks or detect different attack types with a high level of accuracy.
In this work, we propose a statistical approach that establishes a detection
baseline before a neural network's deployment, enabling effective real-time
adversarial detection. We generate a metric of adversarial presence by
comparing the behavior of a compressed/uncompressed neural network pair. Our
method has been tested against state-of-the-art techniques, and it achieves
near-perfect detection across a wide range of attack types. Moreover, it
significantly reduces false positives, making it both reliable and practical
for real-world applications.

Title: Image Enhancement Based on Pigment Representation
Authors: Se-Ho Lee, Keunsoo Ko, and Seung-Wook Kim
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: 14 pages, 9 figures, accepted at IEEE Transactions on Multimedia
  (TMM)
\\
  This paper presents a novel and efficient image enhancement method based on
pigment representation. Unlike conventional methods where the color
transformation is restricted to pre-defined color spaces like RGB, our method
dynamically adapts to input content by transforming RGB colors into a
high-dimensional feature space referred to as \textit{pigments}. The proposed
pigment representation offers adaptability and expressiveness, achieving
superior image enhancement performance. The proposed method involves
transforming input RGB colors into high-dimensional pigments, which are then
reprojected individually and blended to refine and aggregate the information of
the colors in pigment spaces. Those pigments are then transformed back into RGB
colors to generate an enhanced output image. The transformation and
reprojection parameters are derived from the visual encoder which adaptively
estimates such parameters based on the content in the input image. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
method over state-of-the-art methods in image enhancement tasks, including
image retouching and tone mapping, while maintaining relatively low
computational complexity and small model size.

Title: Dale meets Langevin: A Multiplicative Denoising Diffusion Model
Authors: Nishanth Shetty, Madhava Prasath, Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

Title: GCVAMD: A Modified CausalVAE Model for Causal Age-related Macular
  Degeneration Risk Factor Detection and Prediction
Authors: Daeyoung Kim
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) has been one of the most leading causes
of permanent vision impairment in ophthalmology. Though treatments, such as
anti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the
degenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision
loss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD
or AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to
reduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches,
deep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and
GradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in
distinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI
driven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists
regarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works
mostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying
causal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific
factors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a
novel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified
CausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT
images. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal
inference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major
risk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent
causal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through
GCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD
causal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for
various tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.

Title: Confidence and Dispersity as Signals: Unsupervised Model Evaluation and

Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
Comments: 15 pages, 11 figures, extension of ICML'23 work: Confidence and
  Dispersity Speak: Characterizing Prediction Matrix for Unsupervised Accuracy
  Estimation
\\
  Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

Title: Neural Posterior Estimation with Autoregressive Tiling for Detecting
  Objects in Astronomical Images
Authors: Jeffrey Regier
Categories: stat.AP astro-ph.IM cs.CV
MSC-class: 62P35
ACM-class: G.3
\\
  Upcoming astronomical surveys will produce petabytes of high-resolution
images of the night sky, providing information about billions of stars and
galaxies. Detecting and characterizing the astronomical objects in these images
is a fundamental task in astronomy -- and a challenging one, as most of these
objects are faint and many visually overlap with other objects. We propose an
amortized variational inference procedure to solve this instance of
small-object detection. Our key innovation is a family of spatially
autoregressive variational distributions that partition and order the latent
space according to a $K$-color checkerboard pattern. By construction, the
conditional independencies of this variational family mirror those of the
posterior distribution. We fit the variational distribution, which is
parameterized by a convolutional neural network, using neural posterior
estimation (NPE) to minimize an expectation of the forward KL divergence. Using
images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. We further demonstrate that the proposed autoregressive structure
greatly improves posterior calibration.

  Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it
mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,
optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly
modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires
intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage
the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse
navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.
Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360
observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation
models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three
reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information
in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation
capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA
model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is
dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through
extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model
achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student
VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of
integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

  Inference

Categories: cs.CR cs.DC
\\
  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has
revolutionized the AI landscape. However, the deployment model and usage of LLM
services remain highly centralized, creating significant trust issues and costs
for end users and developers. To address these issues, we propose PolyLink, a
blockchain-based decentralized AI platform that decentralizes LLM development
and inference. Specifically, PolyLink introduces a decentralized crowdsourcing
architecture that supports single-device and cross-device model deployment and
inference across heterogeneous devices at the edge. Moreover, to ensure the
inference integrity, we design the TIQE protocol, which combines a lightweight
cross-encoder model and an LLM-as-a-Judge for a high-accuracy inference
evaluation. Lastly, we integrate a comprehensive token-based incentive model
with dynamic pricing and reward mechanisms for all participants. We have
deployed PolyLink and conducted an extensive real-world evaluation through
geo-distributed deployment across heterogeneous devices. Results indicate that
the inference and verification latency is practical. Our security analysis
demonstrates that the system is resistant to model degradation attacks and
validator corruptions. PolyLink is now available at

Title: Action Deviation-Aware Inference for Low-Latency Wireless Robots
Authors: Jeyoung Park, Yeonsub Lim, Seungeun Oh, Jihong Park, Jinho Choi,
  Seong-Lyun Kim
Categories: cs.RO cs.DC
\\
  To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving
to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting
distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable
low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can
facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an
on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target
model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike
autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for
embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot
parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action
depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this
end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft
model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target
model and selectively skips communication and computation for server
operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection
probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the
path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference
performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid
inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while
lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without
skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model
only inference.

\\
  Use of sensor and related analytical predictions can be a powerful tool in
providing data-informed input to viticulturalists' decision process,
complementing their vineyard observations and intuition. Their up-to-date
measurements, predictions, and alerts offer actionable insights and suggestions
for managing key vineyard operations, such as irrigation, disease and pest
control, canopy management, and harvest timing. In many cases, anticipatory
interventions can mitigate risks before problems become apparent. By offering
guidance on the targeting, timing, and dosage of vineyard practices, sensor
data platforms can enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency while
conserving labor and resources when they are not required. They also enable
implementation of the principles of precision viticulture - doing the right
thing, at the right time, in the right place. This paper provides a succinct
summary of the functions, benefits, and practical considerations of sensor data
platforms in viticulture. It may be of interest to viticulturalists as well as
agricultural and IoT researchers.

\\
  Distributed optimization finds applications in large-scale machine learning,
data processing and classification over multi-agent networks. In real-world
scenarios, the communication network of agents may encounter latency that may
affect the convergence of the optimization protocol. This paper addresses the
case where the information exchange among the agents (computing nodes) over
data-transmission channels (links) might be subject to communication
time-delays, which is not well addressed in the existing literature. Our
proposed algorithm improves the state-of-the-art by handling heterogeneous and
arbitrary but bounded and fixed (time-invariant) delays over general
strongly-connected directed networks. Arguments from matrix theory, algebraic
graph theory, and augmented consensus formulation are applied to prove the
convergence to the optimal value. Simulations are provided to verify the
results and compare the performance with some existing delay-free algorithms.

Title: Axiomatisation for an asynchronous epistemic logic with sending and
  receiving messages
Authors: Philippe Balbiani, Hans van Ditmarsch, Clara Lerouvillois
Categories: cs.LO cs.MA
\\
  We investigate a public announcement logic for asynchronous public
announcements wherein the sending of the announcements by the environment is
separated from the reception of the announcements by the individual agents.
Both come with different modalities. In the logical semantics, formulas are
interpreted in a world of a Kripke model but given a history of prior
announcements and receptions of announcements that already happened. An
axiomatisation AA for such a logic has been given in prior work, for the
formulas that are valid when interpreted in the Kripke model before any such
announcements have taken place. This axiomatisation is a reduction system
wherein one can show that every formula is equivalent to a purely epistemic
formula without dynamic modalities for announcements and receptions. We propose
a generalisation AA* of this axiomatisation, for the formulas that are valid
when interpreted in the Kripke model given any history of prior announcements
and receptions of announcements. It does not extend the axiomatisation AA, for
example it is no longer valid that nobody has received any announcement. Unlike
AA, this axiomatisation AA* is infinitary and it is not a reduction system.
