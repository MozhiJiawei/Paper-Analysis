Title: An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems
Authors: Thomas J Sheffler
Categories: cs.AI cs.ET
Comments: 15 pages, 5 figures
\\
  This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

Title: LATTS: Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
Authors: Theo Uscidda and Matthew Trager and Michael Kleinman and Aditya
  Chattopadhyay and Wei Xia and Stefano Soatto
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

Title: Philosophy-informed Machine Learning
Authors: MZ Naser
Categories: cs.AI cs.CY cs.LG
\\
  Philosophy-informed machine learning (PhIML) directly infuses core ideas from
analytic philosophy into ML model architectures, objectives, and evaluation
protocols. Therefore, PhIML promises new capabilities through models that
respect philosophical concepts and values by design. From this lens, this paper
reviews conceptual foundations to demonstrate philosophical gains and
alignment. In addition, we present case studies on how ML users/designers can
adopt PhIML as an agnostic post-hoc tool or intrinsically build it into ML
model architectures. Finally, this paper sheds light on open technical barriers
alongside philosophical, practical, and governance challenges and outlines a
research roadmap toward safe, philosophy-aware, and ethically responsible
PhIML.

Title: InsightGUIDE: An Opinionated AI Assistant for Guided Critical Reading of
  Scientific Literature
Authors: Paris Koloveas, Serafeim Chatzopoulos, Thanasis Vergoulis, Christos
  Tryfonopoulos
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.DL cs.HC
Comments: Accepted for publication on ICTAI 2025
\\
  The proliferation of scientific literature presents an increasingly
significant challenge for researchers. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
promise, existing tools often provide verbose summaries that risk replacing,
rather than assisting, the reading of the source material. This paper
introduces InsightGUIDE, a novel AI-powered tool designed to function as a
reading assistant, not a replacement. Our system provides concise, structured
insights that act as a "map" to a paper's key elements by embedding an expert's
reading methodology directly into its core AI logic. We present the system's
architecture, its prompt-driven methodology, and a qualitative case study
comparing its output to a general-purpose LLM. The results demonstrate that
InsightGUIDE produces more structured and actionable guidance, serving as a
more effective tool for the modern researcher.

Title: Reconstruction-Based Adaptive Scheduling Using AI Inferences in
  Safety-Critical Systems
Authors: Samer Alshaer, Ala Khalifeh, and Roman Obermaisser
Categories: cs.AI cs.DC
Comments: 14 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

Title: Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms
  During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications
Authors: Samer Alshaer, Ala Khalifeh, and Roman Obermaisser
Categories: cs.AI cs.DC cs.LG
Comments: 18 pages, 21 figures
\\
  Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

Title: A Compound Classification System Based on Fuzzy Relations Applied to the
  Noise-Tolerant Control of a Bionic Hand via EMG Signal Recognition
Authors: Pawel Trajdos and Marek Kurzynski
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

Title: SAMULE: Self-Learning Agents Enhanced by Multi-level Reflection
Authors: Yubin Ge, Salvatore Romeo, Jason Cai, Monica Sunkara, Yi Zhang
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Main Conference
\\
  Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Title: Adaptive Cybersecurity Architecture for Digital Product Ecosystems Using
  Agentic AI
Authors: Oluwakemi T. Olayinka, Sumeet Jeswani, and Divine Iloh
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat
mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this
framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Title: Accelerate Creation of Product Claims Using Generative AI
Authors: Po-Yu Liang, Yong Zhang, Tatiana Hwa, Aaron Byers
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: This paper has been accepted at the GenProCC workshop (NeurIPS 2025)
\\
  The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

\\
  Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

Title: Fairy: Interactive Mobile Assistant to Real-world Tasks via LMM-based
  Multi-agent
Authors: Jiazheng Sun, Te Yang, Jiayang Niu, Mingxuan Li, Yongyong Lu, Ruimeng

Categories: cs.AI cs.HC cs.MA
Comments: 20 pages, 12 figures
\\
  Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

Title: Parallel Thinking, Sequential Answering: Bridging NAR and AR for
  Efficient Reasoning
Authors: Qihang Ai, Haiyun Jiang
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 4 pages
\\
  We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Title: Meta-Memory: Retrieving and Integrating Semantic-Spatial Memories for
  Robot Spatial Reasoning
Authors: Yufan Mao, Hanjing Ye, Wenlong Dong, Chengjie Zhang, Hong Zhang
Categories: cs.AI cs.RO
\\
  Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

Title: LogReasoner: Empowering LLMs with Expert-like Coarse-to-Fine Reasoning
  for Log Analysis Tasks
Authors: Lipeng Ma, Yixuan Li, Weidong Yang, Mingjie Zhou, Xinyi Liu, Ben Fei,

Comments: under review
\\
  Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Title: DeFacto: Counterfactual Thinking with Images for Enforcing
  Evidence-Grounded and Faithful Reasoning
Authors: Tianrun Xu, Haoda Jing, Ye Li, Yuquan Wei, Jun Feng, Guanyu Chen,
  Haichuan Gao, Tianren Zhang, and Feng Chen
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

Title: GALAX: Graph-Augmented Language Model for Explainable
  Reinforcement-Guided Subgraph Reasoning in Precision Medicine
Authors: Heming Zhang, Di Huang, Wenyu Li, Michael Province, Yixin Chen, Philip
  Payne, Fuhai Li
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

Comments: 34 pages, 21 figures
\\
  Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Title: CORE: Full-Path Evaluation of LLM Agents Beyond Final State
Authors: Panagiotis Michelakis, Yiannis Hadjiyiannis, Dimitrios Stamoulis

\\
  Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

Title: Who Gets Cited Most? Benchmarking Long-Context Language Models on
  Scientific Articles
Authors: Miao Li, Alexander Gurung, Irina Saparina, Mirella Lapata
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 31 pages
\\
  This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

Title: CLAUSE: Agentic Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Reasoning via Dynamic
  Learnable Context Engineering
Authors: Yang Zhao, Chengxiao Dai, Wei Zhuo, Yue Xiu, Dusit Niyato
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

\\
  Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Title: Disagreements in Reasoning: How a Model's Thinking Process Dictates
  Persuasion in Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Haodong Zhao, Jidong Li, Zhaomin Wu, Tianjie Ju, Zhuosheng Zhang,
  Bingsheng He, Gongshen Liu
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: Work in progress
\\
  The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Title: Recon-Act: A Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Browser-Use System via Web
  Reconnaissance, Tool Generation, and Task Execution
Authors: Kaiwen He, Zhiwei Wang, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

  The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

Title: Expanding Reasoning Potential in Foundation Model by Learning Diverse
  Chains of Thought Patterns
Authors: Xuemiao Zhang, Can Ren, Chengying Tu, Rongxiang Weng, Shuo Wang,
  Hongfei Yan, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Title: RL Squeezes, SFT Expands: A Comparative Study of Reasoning LLMs
Authors: Kohsei Matsutani, Shota Takashiro, Gouki Minegishi, Takeshi Kojima,
  Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

Title: ToMPO: Training LLM Strategic Decision Making from a Multi-Agent
  Perspective
Authors: Yiwen Zhang, Ziang Chen, Fanqi Kong, Yizhe Huang, Xue Feng
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA
Comments: 22 pages, 14 figures
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

Title: Embodied Representation Alignment with Mirror Neurons
Authors: Wentao Zhu, Zhining Zhang, Yuwei Ren, Yin Huang, Hao Xu, Yizhou Wang
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: ICCV 2025
\\
  Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

Title: Distributed Specialization: Rare-Token Neurons in Large Language Models
Authors: Jing Liu, Haozheng Wang, Yueheng Li
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

Title: A Fano-Style Accuracy Upper Bound for LLM Single-Pass Reasoning in
  Multi-Hop QA
Authors: Kaiyang Wan, Lang Gao, Honglin Mu, Preslav Nakov, Yuxia Wang, Xiuying
  Chen
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 21 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

Title: What Do LLM Agents Do When Left Alone? Evidence of Spontaneous
  Meta-Cognitive Patterns
Authors: Stefan Szeider
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

Categories: cs.AI
Comments: under review
\\
  Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark

  Abilities, and Scaling
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

Title: Interpreting Public Sentiment in Diplomacy Events: A Counterfactual
  Analysis Framework Using Large Language Models
Authors: Leyi Ouyang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.CY
Comments: 2 Figures, 7 Tables, 1 Algorithm
\\
  Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

Title: Speaker Style-Aware Phoneme Anchoring for Improved Cross-Lingual Speech
  Emotion Recognition
Authors: Shreya G. Upadhyay, Carlos Busso, and Chi-Chun Lee
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of
complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains
underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past
decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging
testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce
CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components --
CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM
performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver
reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability,
solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes
a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation
of numerical experiments for complex physical systems. Code and data are

Title: Assessing Classical Machine Learning and Transformer-based Approaches
  for Detecting AI-Generated Research Text
Authors: Sharanya Parimanoharan and Ruwan D. Nawarathna
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

  Language Models

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at

Title: SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Authors: Tomoaki Isoda
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

Title: Beyond Global Emotion: Fine-Grained Emotional Speech Synthesis with
  Dynamic Word-Level Modulation
Authors: Sirui Wang, Andong Chen, Tiejun Zhao
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

Title: USB-Rec: An Effective Framework for Improving Conversational
  Recommendation Capability of Large Language Model
Authors: Jianyu Wen, Jingyun Wang, Cilin Yan, Jiayin Cai, Xiaolong Jiang, Ying
  Zhang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Accepted by Recsys'25
\\
  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

\\
  Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

Title: MARS: toward more efficient multi-agent collaboration for LLM reasoning
Authors: Xiao Wang, Jia Wang, Yijie Wang, Pengtao Dang, Sha Cao, Chi Zhang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at
https://github.com/xwang97/MARS.

existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,

utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

Title: SwasthLLM: a Unified Cross-Lingual, Multi-Task, and Meta-Learning
  Zero-Shot Framework for Medical Diagnosis Using Contrastive Representations
Authors: Ayan Sar, Pranav Singh Puri, Sumit Aich, Tanupriya Choudhury, Abhijit
  Kumar
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR
Comments: Submitted to International Conference on Big Data 2025
\\
  In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

Title: Dynamic Reasoning Chains through Depth-Specialized Mixture-of-Experts in

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR

\\
  Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

Title: Hierarchical Resolution Transformers: A Wavelet-Inspired Architecture
  for Multi-Scale Language Understanding
Authors: Ayan Sar, Sampurna Roy, Kanav Gupta, Anurag Kaushish, Tanupriya

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR
Comments: Submitted in IEEE International Conference on Big Data 2025
\\
  Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

Title: FS-DFM: Fast and Accurate Long Text Generation with Few-Step Diffusion
  Language Models
Authors: Amin Karimi Monsefi, Nikhil Bhendawade, Manuel Rafael Ciosici, Dominic
  Culver, Yizhe Zhang, Irina Belousova
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

Title: Look Before you Leap: Estimating LLM Benchmark Scores from Descriptions
Authors: Jungsoo Park, Ethan Mendes, Gabriel Stanovsky, Alan Ritter
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 24 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

Title: Building Tailored Speech Recognizers for Japanese Speaking Assessment
Authors: Yotaro Kubo, Richard Sproat, Chihiro Taguchi, Llion Jones
Categories: cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS
\\
  This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

Title: Enhancing Molecular Property Prediction with Knowledge from Large
  Language Models

\\
  Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

Title: RedHerring Attack: Testing the Reliability of Attack Detection
Authors: Jonathan Rusert
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures, Accepted to EMNLP 2025
ACM-class: I.2.7
\\
  In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

Title: Overcoming Black-box Attack Inefficiency with Hybrid and Dynamic Select
  Algorithms
Authors: Abhinay Shankar Belde, Rohit Ramkumar, Jonathan Rusert

Comments: 34 pages, 3 figures, Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025
ACM-class: I.2.7
\\
  Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

Title: MI-Fuse: Label Fusion for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with
  Closed-Source Large-Audio Language Model
Authors: Hsiao-Ying Huang, Yi-Cheng Lin, Hung-yi Lee
Categories: cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

  Unsupervised Neural Grammar Induction
Authors: Jinwook Park, Kangil Kim
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted in EMNLP2025 Main, 12 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables
\\
  Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

Title: Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning for Zero-shot Question Answering
Authors: Youwon Jang, Woo Suk Choi, Minjoon Jung, Minsu Lee, Byoung-Tak Zhang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 18 pages (including references and appendix)
\\
  We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

  Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

Title: Towards Atoms of Large Language Models
Authors: Chenhui Hu, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

Title: Few-Shot and Training-Free Review Generation via Conversational
  Prompting
Authors: Genki Kusano
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
\\
  Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

Title: Enrich-on-Graph: Query-Graph Alignment for Complex Reasoning with LLM
  Enriching
Authors: Songze Li, Zhiqiang Liu, Zhengke Gui, Huajun Chen, Wen Zhang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

Title: Leveraging What's Overfixed: Post-Correction via LLM Grammatical Error
  Overcorrection
Authors: Taehee Park, Heejin Do, Gary Geunbae Lee
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: EMNLP 2025
\\
  Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Findings)
\\
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

Title: Zero-Shot Privacy-Aware Text Rewriting via Iterative Tree Search
Authors: Shuo Huang, Xingliang Yuan, Gholamreza Haffari, Lizhen Qu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

Title: Concise and Sufficient Sub-Sentence Citations for Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation
Authors: Guo Chen, Qiuyuan Li, Qiuxian Li, Hongliang Dai, Xiang Chen, Piji Li
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

Title: WeFT: Weighted Entropy-driven Fine-Tuning for dLLMs
Authors: Guowei Xu, Wenxin Xu, Jiawang Zhao, Kaisheng Ma
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: preprint
\\
  Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

  This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

Title: Learning to Summarize by Learning to Quiz: Adversarial Agentic
  Collaboration for Long Document Summarization
Authors: Weixuan Wang, Minghao Wu, Barry Haddow, Alexandra Birch
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

Title: MemLens: Uncovering Memorization in LLMs with Activation Trajectories
Authors: Zirui He, Haiyan Zhao, Ali Payani, Mengnan du
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 20pages, 11 figures, 7 tables
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

Title: Cross-Linguistic Analysis of Memory Load in Sentence Comprehension:
  Linear Distance and Structural Density
Authors: Krishna Aggarwal
Categories: cs.CL q-bio.NC
Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures (Figure 2 has 3 sub-divisions)
\\
  This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and

Title: Tool Calling for Arabic LLMs: Data Strategies and Instruction Tuning
Authors: Asim Ersoy, Enes Altinisik, Husrev Taha Sencar, Kareem Darwish
Categories: cs.CL
Journal-ref: ArabicNLP 2025
\\
  Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

Title: Analysis of instruction-based LLMs' capabilities to score and judge
  text-input problems in an academic setting
Authors: Valeria Ramirez-Garcia, David de-Fitero-Dominguez, Antonio
  Garcia-Cabot, Eva Garcia-Lopez
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

  Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) face text-heavy
workloads, from policy documents to scientific and engineering papers, that are
slow to analyze manually. We show how large language models can accelerate
summarization, classification, extraction, and sense-making with only a few
input-output examples. To enable use in sensitive government contexts, we apply
OnPrem$.$LLM, an open-source framework for secure and flexible application of
generative AI. Case studies on defense policy documents and scientific corpora,
including the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and National Science
Foundation (NSF) Awards, demonstrate how this approach enhances oversight and
strategic analysis while maintaining auditability and data sovereignty.

Title: Behind RoPE: How Does Causal Mask Encode Positional Information?

Comments: Codes available at:

\\
  While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

\\
  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

Title: SoM-1K: A Thousand-Problem Benchmark Dataset for Strength of Materials
Authors: Qixin Wan, Zilong Wang, Jingwen Zhou, Wanting Wang, Ziheng Geng,

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

Title: Which Cultural Lens Do Models Adopt? On Cultural Positioning Bias and
  Agentic Mitigation in LLMs
Authors: Yixin Wan, Xingrun Chen, Kai-Wei Chang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.CY
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

Title: BESPOKE: Benchmark for Search-Augmented Large Language Model
  Personalization via Diagnostic Feedback
Authors: Hyunseo Kim, Sangam Lee, Kwangwook Seo, Dongha Lee
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
Comments: Work in progress
\\
  Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at
https://augustinlib.github.io/BESPOKE/.

Title: VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias
  of Spoken Language Model
Authors: Junhyuk Choi, Ro-hoon Oh, Jihwan Seol, Bugeun Kim
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted EMNLP 2025 main
\\
  We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

Title: Acoustic-based Gender Differentiation in Speech-aware Language Models

  Kim
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Under Review
\\
  Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

Comments: Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Main Conference
\\
  Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

Comments: NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight
\\
  For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

\\
  The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 16 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables. Under review as a conference paper at

\\
  Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

  Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

Title: CLaw: Benchmarking Chinese Legal Knowledge in Large Language Models - A
  Fine-grained Corpus and Reasoning Analysis
Authors: Xinzhe Xu, Liang Zhao, Hongshen Xu, Chen Chen
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

Title: Query-Centric Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation
Authors: Yaxiong Wu, Jianyuan Bo, Yongyue Zhang, Sheng Liang, Yong Liu

  Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

Title: Un-Doubling Diffusion: LLM-guided Disambiguation of Homonym Duplication
Authors: Evgeny Kaskov, Elizaveta Petrova, Petr Surovtsev, Anna Kostikova, Ilya
  Mistiurin, Alexander Kapitanov, Alexander Nagaev
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

Title: LLM Output Homogenization is Task Dependent
Authors: Shomik Jain, Jack Lanchantin, Maximilian Nickel, Karen Ullrich, Ashia
  Wilson, Jamelle Watson-Daniels
Categories: cs.CL cs.CY
\\
  A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

  AI-Written Text
Authors: Irina Tolstykh, Aleksandra Tsybina, Sergey Yakubson, Maksim

Categories: cs.CL
MSC-class: cs.CL
\\
  The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

Title: Bounds of Chain-of-Thought Robustness: Reasoning Steps, Embed Norms, and
  Beyond
Authors: Dingzirui Wang, Xuanliang Zhang, Keyan Xu, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che,
  Yang Deng
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

  Vision-Language Understanding
Authors: Kin Ian Lo and Hala Hawashin and Mina Abbaszadeh and Tilen

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

Comments: Under Review
\\
  Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

Title: Sycophancy Is Not One Thing: Causal Separation of Sycophantic Behaviors
  in LLMs
Authors: Daniel Vennemeyer, Phan Anh Duong, Tiffany Zhan, Tianyu Jiang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

Title: RLBFF: Binary Flexible Feedback to bridge between Human Feedback &
  Verifiable Rewards
Authors: Zhilin Wang, Jiaqi Zeng, Olivier Delalleau, Ellie Evans, Daniel Egert,

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and
sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed
cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and
reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills
deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering
up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and
scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction,
(iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence

Title: Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs
Authors: Ofir Azachi, Kfir Eliyahu, Eyal El Ani, Rom Himelstein, Roi Reichart,
  Yuval Pinter, Nitay Calderon
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

Title: Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent
  Offline Signature Verification
Authors: Elias N. Zois, Moises Diaz, Salem Said and Miguel A. Ferrer
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 9 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

  We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on

Title: A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection
Authors: Samia Saeed and Khuram Naveed
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

  Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

  Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

  We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

Title: A Comparative Benchmark of Real-time Detectors for Blueberry Detection
  towards Precision Orchard Management

  character limit
\\
  Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

Title: Region-of-Interest Augmentation for Mammography Classification under
  Patient-Level Cross-Validation
Authors: Farbod Bigdeli, Mohsen Mohammadagha and Ali Bigdeli
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

Title: Reflect3r: Single-View 3D Stereo Reconstruction Aided by Mirror
  Reflections
Authors: Jing Wu, Zirui Wang, Iro Laina, Victor Adrian Prisacariu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

  Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

Title: Human Semantic Representations of Social Interactions from Moving Shapes
Authors: Yiling Yun, Hongjing Lu
Categories: cs.CV cs.CE cs.CL
\\
  Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Title: Enhancing Cross-View Geo-Localization Generalization via Global-Local
  Consistency and Geometric Equivariance
Authors: Xiaowei Wang, Di Wang, Ke Li, Yifeng Wang, Chengjian Wang, Libin Sun,
  Zhihong Wu, Yiming Zhang, Quan Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Title: DENet: Dual-Path Edge Network with Global-Local Attention for Infrared
  Small Target Detection
Authors: Jiayi Zuo, Songwei Pei and Qian Li
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

  and Danni Xu and Xian Zhong and Zheng Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

  Detection
Authors: Yu Guo, Shengfeng He, Yuxu Lu, Haonan An, Yihang Tao, Huilin Zhu,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

Title: AI-Enabled Crater-Based Navigation for Lunar Mapping
Authors: Sofia McLeod, Chee-Kheng Chng, Matthew Rodda, Tat-Jun Chin
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 41 pages, 21 figures
\\
  Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

Title: Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels: Deep Representational
  Alignment Between Vision and Language Models
Authors: Zoe Wanying He, Sean Trott, Meenakshi Khosla
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (camera-ready)
\\
  Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

Title: FreeInsert: Personalized Object Insertion with Geometric and Style
  Control
Authors: Yuhong Zhang, Han Wang, Yiwen Wang, Rong Xie, Li Song
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

  With the increasing use of neural network (NN)-based computer vision
applications that process image and video data as input, interest has emerged
in video compression technology optimized for computer vision tasks. In fact,
given the variety of vision tasks, associated NN models and datasets, a
consolidated platform is needed as a common ground to implement and evaluate
compression methods optimized for downstream vision tasks. CompressAI-Vision is

compete to efficiently compress the input of vision network while retaining
task accuracy in the context of two different inference scenarios: "remote" and
"split" inferencing. Our study showcases various use cases of the evaluation

compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.
This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is

Title: Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training for Semi-supervised Medical
  Domain Generalization
Authors: Jincai Song, Haipeng Chen, Jun Qin, Na Zhao

Comments: 13 pages, 14 figures
DOI: 10.1109/TMM.2025.3613080
\\
  Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

Title: DAC-LoRA: Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum for Efficient and Robust
  Few-Shot Adaptation
Authors: Ved Umrajkar

Comments: Accepted at ICCV2025 Workshop on Safe and Trustworthy Multimodal AI
  Systems
\\
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

Title: Federated Domain Generalization with Domain-specific Soft Prompts
  Generation

Comments: Accepted to the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision
  (ICCV 2025)
\\
  Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Comments: 12 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

Title: Poisoning Prompt-Guided Sampling in Video Large Language Models
Authors: Yuxin Cao, Wei Song, Jingling Xue, Jin Song Dong
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

  Learnable Regularizer
Authors: Abdur Rehman, S M A Sharif, Md Abdur Rahaman, Mohamed Jismy Aashik

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

\\
  The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

  Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

Title: SD-RetinaNet: Topologically Constrained Semi-Supervised Retinal Lesion
  and Layer Segmentation in OCT
Authors: Botond Fazekas, Guilherme Aresta, Philipp Seeb\"ock, Julia Mai, Ursula
  Schmidt-Erfurth, Hrvoje Bogunovi\'c
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

  The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This

  Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications 2025
\\
  Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

Title: The Unanticipated Asymmetry Between Perceptual Optimization and
  Assessment
Authors: Jiabei Zhang, Qi Wang, Siyu Wu, Du Chen, Tianhe Wu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

  Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

  Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

  The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

Title: Concepts in Motion: Temporal Bottlenecks for Interpretable Video
  Classification
Authors: Patrick Knab, Sascha Marton, Philipp J. Schubert, Drago Guggiana,
  Christian Bartelt
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

\\
  3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

Title: SwinMamba: A hybrid local-global mamba framework for enhancing semantic
  segmentation of remotely sensed images
Authors: Qinfeng Zhu, Han Li, Liang He, Lei Fan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

Title: Revisiting Data Challenges of Computational Pathology: A Pack-based
  Multiple Instance Learning Framework
Authors: Wenhao Tang, Heng Fang, Ge Wu, Xiang Li, Ming-Ming Cheng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 26 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

Title: SimDiff: Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model for Physically Plausible
  Motion Generation
Authors: Akihisa Watanabe, Jiawei Ren, Li Siyao, Yichen Peng, Erwin Wu, Edgar
  Simo-Serra
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Title: Unlocking Noise-Resistant Vision: Key Architectural Secrets for Robust
  Models
Authors: Bum Jun Kim, Makoto Kawano, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 30 pages, 5 figures
\\
  While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

  Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new
generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and
training.

Title: A Real-Time On-Device Defect Detection Framework for Laser Power-Meter
  Sensors via Unsupervised Learning
Authors: Dongqi Zheng, Wenjin Fu, Guangzong Chen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.
The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality
control and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device
implementation.

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for
research. The dataset and code are available at:

Title: An Adaptor for Triggering Semi-Supervised Learning to Out-of-Box Serve
  Deep Image Clustering
Authors: Yue Duan, Lei Qi, Yinghuan Shi, Yang Gao
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)
\\
  Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

\\
  Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

  Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth
observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor
configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose
Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

Title: A Single Neuron Works: Precise Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image
  Diffusion Models
Authors: Qinqin He, Jiaqi Weng, Jialing Tao, Hui Xue
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

Title: OmniPlantSeg: Species Agnostic 3D Point Cloud Organ Segmentation for
  High-Resolution Plant Phenotyping Across Modalities
Authors: Andreas Gilson, Lukas Meyer, Oliver Scholz, Ute Schmid
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

Title: Background Prompt for Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection
Authors: Songyue Cai, Zongqian Wu, Yujie Mo, Liang Peng, Ping Hu, Xiaoshuang
  Shi, and Xiaofeng Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

\\
  Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

Title: EnGraf-Net: Multiple Granularity Branch Network with Fine-Coarse Graft
  Grained for Classification Task
Authors: Riccardo La Grassa and Ignazio Gallo and Nicola Landro
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 8
\\
  Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

  The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

Comments: NeuriIPS 2025
\\
  We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

\\
  Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

Title: MOSS-ChatV: Reinforcement Learning with Process Reasoning Reward for
  Video Temporal Reasoning
Authors: Sicheng Tao, Jungang Li, Yibo Yan, Junyan Zhang, Yubo Gao, Hanqian Li,

\\
  Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Title: MotionFlow:Learning Implicit Motion Flow for Complex Camera Trajectory
  Control in Video Generation
Authors: Guojun Lei, Chi Wang, Yikai Wang, Hong Li, Ying Song, Weiwei Xu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ICME2025
\\
  Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Title: The Unwinnable Arms Race of AI Image Detection
Authors: Till Aczel, Lorenzo Vettor, Andreas Plesner, Roger Wattenhofer
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Title: WAVECLIP: Wavelet Tokenization for Adaptive-Resolution CLIP
Authors: Moshe Kimhi, Erez Koifman, Ehud Rivlin, Eli Schwartz, Chaim Baskin
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.MM
\\
  We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Title: Can Less Precise Be More Reliable? A Systematic Evaluation of
  Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy
Authors: Aymen Bouguerra, Daniel Montoya, Alexandra Gomez-Villa, Fabio Arnez,
  Chokri Mraidha
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

Title: TABLET: A Large-Scale Dataset for Robust Visual Table Understanding
Authors: I\~nigo Alonso, Imanol Miranda, Eneko Agirre, Mirella Lapata
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
\\
  While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

Title: Learning Conformal Explainers for Image Classifiers
Authors: Amr Alkhatib and Stephanie Lowry
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

Title: Sigma: Semantically Informative Pre-training for Skeleton-based Sign
  Language Understanding
Authors: Muxin Pu, Mei Kuan Lim, Chun Yong Chong, Chen Change Loy
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
\\
  Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

  Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

  Representation Learning in Digital Pathology
Authors: Shakib Khan, Fariba Dambandkhameneh, Nazim Shaikh, Yao Nie, Raghavan
  Venugopal, Xiao Li
Categories: cs.CV q-bio.QM
\\
  Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

  Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent
performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.
Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for

\\
  The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

  Evaluation
Authors: Seyed Amir Kasaei, Mohammad Hossein Rohban
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
Comments: Accepted at GenProCC NeurIPS 2025 Workshop
\\
  In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

  Recognition via Distributionally Robust Optimization
Authors: Feng-Qi Cui, Jinyang Huang, Anyang Tong, Ziyu Jia, Jie Zhang, Zhi Liu,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

Title: Dense Semantic Matching with VGGT Prior
Authors: Songlin Yang, Tianyi Wei, Yushi Lan, Zeqi Xiao, Anyi Rao, Xingang Pan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

  High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

  Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

  Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

Title: Does FLUX Already Know How to Perform Physically Plausible Image
  Composition?
Authors: Shilin Lu, Zhuming Lian, Zihan Zhou, Shaocong Zhang, Chen Zhao, Adams

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Preprint
\\
  Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

Title: NewtonGen: Physics-Consistent and Controllable Text-to-Video Generation

\\
  A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

  We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step
generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce
gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.

  Scientific Data Compression Pipelines
Authors: Skyler Ruiter, Jiannan Tian, Fengguang Song
Categories: cs.DC
DOI: 10.1145/3731599.3767376
\\
  Modern scientific simulations and instruments generate data volumes that
overwhelm memory and storage, throttling scalability. Lossy compression
mitigates this by trading controlled error for reduced footprint and throughput
gains, yet optimal pipelines are highly data and objective specific, demanding
compression expertise. GPU compressors supply raw throughput but often
hard-code fused kernels that hinder rapid experimentation, and underperform in
rate-distortion. We present FZModules, a heterogeneous framework for assembling
error-bounded custom compression pipelines from high-performance modules
through a concise extensible interface. We further utilize an asynchronous
task-backed execution library that infers data dependencies, manages memory
movement, and exposes branch and stage level concurrency for powerful
asynchronous compression pipelines. Evaluating three pipelines built with
FZModules on four representative scientific datasets, we show they can compare
end-to-end speedup of fused-kernel GPU compressors while achieving similar
rate-distortion to higher fidelity CPU or hybrid compressors, enabling rapid,
domain-tailored design.

  Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) applications are built from
specialized components -- inference servers, object storage, vector and graph
databases, and user interfaces -- interconnected via web-based APIs. While
these components are often containerized and deployed in cloud environments,
such capabilities are still emerging at High-Performance Computing (HPC)
centers. In this paper, we share our experience deploying GenAI workloads
within an established HPC center, discussing the integration of HPC and cloud
computing environments. We describe our converged computing architecture that
integrates HPC and Kubernetes platforms running containerized GenAI workloads,
helping with reproducibility. A case study illustrates the deployment of the
Llama Large Language Model (LLM) using a containerized inference server (vLLM)
across both Kubernetes and HPC platforms using multiple container runtimes. Our
experience highlights practical considerations and opportunities for the HPC
container community, guiding future research and tool development.

Categories: cs.DC cs.MS
Comments: 32 pages
ACM-class: G.4
\\
  We present scalable distributed-memory algorithms for sparse matrix
permutation, extraction, and assignment. Our methods follow an
Identify-Exchange-Build (IEB) strategy where each process identifies the local
nonzeros to be sent, exchanges the required data, and then builds its local
submatrix from the received elements. This approach reduces communication
compared to SpGEMM-based methods in distributed memory. By employing
synchronization-free multithreaded algorithms, we further accelerate local
computations, achieving substantially better performance than existing
libraries such as CombBLAS and PETSc. We design efficient software for these
operations and evaluate their performance on two university clusters and the
Perlmutter supercomputer. Our experiments span a variety of application
scenarios, including matrix permutation for load balancing, matrix reordering,
subgraph extraction, and streaming graph applications. In all cases, we compare
our algorithms against CombBLAS, the most comprehensive distributed library for
these operations, and, in some scenarios, against PETSc. Overall, this work
provides a comprehensive study of algorithms, software implementations,
experimental evaluations, and applications for sparse matrix permutation,
extraction, and assignment.

  Scientific workflows increasingly involve both HPC and machine-learning
tasks, combining MPI-based simulations, training, and inference in a single
execution. Launchers such as Slurm's srun constrain concurrency and throughput,
making them unsuitable for dynamic and heterogeneous workloads. We present a
performance study of RADICAL-Pilot (RP) integrated with Flux and Dragon, two
complementary runtime systems that enable hierarchical resource management and
high-throughput function execution. Using synthetic and production-scale
workloads on Frontier, we characterize the task execution properties of RP
across runtime configurations. RP+Flux sustains up to 930 tasks/s, and
RP+Flux+Dragon exceeds 1,500 tasks/s with over 99.6% utilization. In contrast,
srun peaks at 152 tasks/s and degrades with scale, with utilization below 50%.
For IMPECCABLE.v2 drug discovery campaign, RP+Flux reduces makespan by 30-60%
relative to srun/Slurm and increases throughput more than four times on up to
1,024. These results demonstrate hybrid runtime integration in RP as a scalable
approach for hybrid AI-HPC workloads.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a pivotal post-training technique for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
synchronous RL post-training often suffers from significant GPU
underutilization, referred to as bubbles, caused by imbalanced response lengths
within rollout steps. Many RL systems attempt to alleviate this problem by
relaxing synchronization, but this can compromise training accuracy. In this
paper, we introduce tail batching, a novel rollout scheduling strategy for
synchronous RL that systematically consolidates prompts leading to long-tail
responses into a small subset of rollout steps (long rounds), while ensuring
that the majority of steps (short rounds) involve only balanced, short
rollouts. By excluding long responses from short rounds and rescheduling them
into a few designated long rounds, tail batching effectively reduces GPU idle
time during rollouts and significantly accelerates RL training without
sacrificing accuracy. We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the
benefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL
stages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation
and scheduling for reward, and stream-based training. Empirical results show
that RollPacker achieves a 2.03x-2.56x end-to-end training time reduction
compared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse for the Qwen2.5
family of LLMs on up to 128 H800 GPUs.

  Schur complement matrices emerge in many domain decomposition methods that
can solve complex engineering problems using supercomputers. Today, as most of
the high-performance clusters' performance lies in GPUs, these methods should
also be accelerated.
  Typically, the offloaded components are the explicitly assembled dense Schur
complement matrices used later in the iterative solver for multiplication with
a vector. As the explicit assembly is expensive, it represents a significant
overhead associated with this approach to acceleration. It has already been
shown that the overhead can be minimized by assembling the Schur complements
directly on the GPU.
  This paper shows that the GPU assembly can be further improved by wisely
utilizing the sparsity of the input matrices. In the context of FETI methods,
we achieved a speedup of 5.1 in the GPU section of the code and 3.3 for the
whole assembly, making the acceleration beneficial from as few as 10
iterations.

  We explore the performance and portability of the novel Mojo language for
scientific computing workloads on GPUs. As the first language based on the
LLVM's Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) compiler infrastructure,
Mojo aims to close performance and productivity gaps by combining Python's
interoperability and CUDA-like syntax for compile-time portable GPU
programming. We target four scientific workloads: a seven-point stencil
(memory-bound), BabelStream (memory-bound), miniBUDE (compute-bound), and
Hartree-Fock (compute-bound with atomic operations); and compare their
performance against vendor baselines on NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300A GPUs. We
show that Mojo's performance is competitive with CUDA and HIP for memory-bound
kernels, whereas gaps exist on AMD GPUs for atomic operations and for fast-math
compute-bound kernels on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. Although the learning curve
and programming requirements are still fairly low-level, Mojo can close
significant gaps in the fragmented Python ecosystem in the convergence of
scientific computing and AI.

  The exponential growth of computational workloads is surpassing the
capabilities of conventional architectures, which are constrained by
fundamental limits. In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising
alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency
and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional
architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained
optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains
cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory
primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays
of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates
robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric
block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We
integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate
performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against
GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our
RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of
magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results
demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the
transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving
large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.

Title: Data-Centric Elastic Pipeline Parallelism for Efficient Long-Context LLM
  Training
Authors: Shiju Wang, Yujie Wang, Ao Sun, Fangcheng Fu, Zijian Zhu, Bin Cui, Xu
  Han, Kaisheng Ma
Categories: cs.DC cs.AI
\\
  Long context training is crucial for LLM's context extension. Existing
schemes, such as sequence parallelism, incur substantial communication
overhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness
hinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples
exhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level
PP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur
hardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP
granularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence
length distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a
challenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP
scheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism
(EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource
and workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system
that unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and
workload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short
ones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline
schedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware
chunk-level adaptive checkpointing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
InfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems.

Title: Structuring Collective Action with LLM-Guided Evolution: From
  Ill-Structured Problems to Executable Heuristics
Authors: Kevin Bradley Dsouza, Graham Alexander Watt, Yuri Leonenko, Juan
  Moreno-Cruz
Categories: cs.MA cs.LG
\\
  Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with
collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For
an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes
are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear
algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present
ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into
a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering
compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework
operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from
Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral
policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference & Messaging for
Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages
that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a
large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and
context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains
those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We
demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape
management, where local farming decisions impact global ecological
connectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics
compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align
simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling
algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms
the cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level
instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice
and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.

Title: RadAgents: Multimodal Agentic Reasoning for Chest X-ray Interpretation
  with Radiologist-like Workflows
Authors: Kai Zhang, Corey D Barrett, Jangwon Kim, Lichao Sun, Tara Taghavi, and
  Krishnaram Kenthapadi
Categories: cs.MA cs.CL cs.CV
Comments: In progress
\\
  Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks
through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and
external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation,
prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither
clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere
aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused,
yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems
rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled
verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a
multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with
task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and
multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts,
resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with
clinical practice.

Title: AI-driven formative assessment and adaptive learning in data-science
  education: Evaluating an LLM-powered virtual teaching assistant
Authors: Fadjimata I Anaroua, Qing Li, Yan Tang, Hong P. Liu
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.HC
ACM-class: F.2.2, I.2.7
\\
  This paper presents VITA (Virtual Teaching Assistants), an adaptive
distributed learning (ADL) platform that embeds a large language model
(LLM)-powered chatbot (BotCaptain) to provide dialogic support, interoperable
analytics, and integrity-aware assessment for workforce preparation in data
science. The platform couples context-aware conversational tutoring with
formative-assessment patterns designed to promote reflective reasoning. The
paper describes an end-to-end data pipeline that transforms chat logs into
Experience API (xAPI) statements, instructor dashboards that surface outliers
for just-in-time intervention, and an adaptive pathway engine that routes
learners among progression, reinforcement, and remediation content. The paper
also benchmarks VITA conceptually against emerging tutoring architectures,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)--based assistants and Learning
Tools Interoperability (LTI)--integrated hubs, highlighting trade-offs among
content grounding, interoperability, and deployment complexity. Contributions
include a reusable architecture for interoperable conversational analytics, a
catalog of patterns for integrity-preserving formative assessment, and a
practical blueprint for integrating adaptive pathways into data-science
courses. The paper concludes with implementation lessons and a roadmap (RAG
integration, hallucination mitigation, and LTI~1.3 / OpenID Connect) to guide
multi-course evaluations and broader adoption. In light of growing demand and
scalability constraints in traditional instruction, the approach illustrates
how conversational AI can support engagement, timely feedback, and personalized
learning at scale. Future work will refine the platform's adaptive intelligence
and examine applicability across varied educational settings.

Title: ACCeLLiuM: Supervised Fine-Tuning for Automated OpenACC Pragma
  Generation
Authors: Samyak Jhaveri, Vanessa Klotzmann, Crista Lopes
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.PL
\\
  The increasing ubiquity of GPUs is accompanied by the increasing complexity
of their hardware and parallel programming frameworks. Directive-based parallel
programming standards like OpenACC simplify GPU programming to some extent by
abstracting away low-level complexities, but a fair amount of expertise is
still required in order to use those directives effectively.
  We introduce ACCeLLiuM, two open weights Large Language Models specifically
fine-tuned for generating expert OpenACC directives for data-parallel loops,
along with the supervised fine-tuning dataset that was used to train them. The
ACCeLLiuM SFT dataset contains 4,033 OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from
public GitHub C/C++ repositories, with 3,223 pairs for training and 810 for
testing. Experimental evaluations show a pronounced performance gap in
generating correct OpenACC pragmas between base LLMs and our fine-tuned
versions. On the held-out test set, base LLMs fail to consistently generate
valid pragmas, whereas LLMs fine-tuned on the ACCeLLiuM dataset generate valid
pragmas with the correct directive type for $87\%$ of the data-parallel loops,
and exact pragmas--including directives, clauses, clause order, and clause
variables--for $50\%$ of the cases. Even when not exact, generated pragmas
frequently incorporate the correct clauses in a different order than the
ground-truth label, or include additional clauses that enable finer control
over parallel execution, data movement, and concurrency, offering practical
value beyond strict string-matching. By publicly releasing the code, models,
and dataset as ACCeLLiuM we hope to establish a reproducible benchmark for
LLM-powered OpenACC pragma generation, and lower the barrier to automated GPU
offloading of serially written programs.

Comments: 5 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables
\\
  ECG biometrics offer a unique, secure authentication method, yet their
deployment on wearable devices faces real-time processing, privacy, and
spoofing vulnerability challenges. This paper proposes a lightweight deep
learning model (MobileNetV1+GRU) for ECG-based authentication, injection of
20dB Gaussian noise & custom preprocessing. We simulate wearable conditions and
edge deployment using the ECGID, MIT-BIH, CYBHi, and PTB datasets, achieving
accuracies of 99.34%, 99.31%, 91.74%, and 98.49%, F1-scores of 0.9869, 0.9923,
0.9125, and 0.9771, Precision of 0.9866, 0.9924, 0.9180 and 0.9845, Recall of
0.9878, 0.9923, 0.9129, and 0.9756, equal error rates (EER) of 0.0009, 0.00013,
0.0091, and 0.0009, and ROC-AUC values of 0.9999, 0.9999, 0.9985, and 0.9998,
while under FGSM adversarial attacks, accuracy drops from 96.82% to as low as
0.80%. This paper highlights federated learning, adversarial testing, and the
need for diverse wearable physiological datasets to ensure secure and scalable
biometrics.

Title: MARS: A Malignity-Aware Backdoor Defense in Federated Learning
Authors: Wei Wan, Yuxuan Ning, Zhicong Huang, Cheng Hong, Shengshan Hu, Ziqi
  Zhou, Yechao Zhang, Tianqing Zhu, Wanlei Zhou, Leo Yu Zhang
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
Comments: NeurIPS 2025
\\
  Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed paradigm aimed at protecting
participant data privacy by exchanging model parameters to achieve high-quality
model training. However, this distributed nature also makes FL highly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Notably, the recently proposed state-of-the-art
(SOTA) attack, 3DFed (SP2023), uses an indicator mechanism to determine whether
the backdoor models have been accepted by the defender and adaptively optimizes
backdoor models, rendering existing defenses ineffective. In this paper, we
first reveal that the failure of existing defenses lies in the employment of
empirical statistical measures that are loosely coupled with backdoor attacks.
Motivated by this, we propose a Malignity-Aware backdooR defenSe (MARS) that
leverages backdoor energy (BE) to indicate the malicious extent of each neuron.
To amplify malignity, we further extract the most prominent BE values from each
model to form a concentrated backdoor energy (CBE). Finally, a novel
Wasserstein distance-based clustering method is introduced to effectively
identify backdoor models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MARS can
defend against SOTA backdoor attacks and significantly outperforms existing
defenses.

Title: R1-Fuzz: Specializing Language Models for Textual Fuzzing via
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Jiayi Lin, Liangcai Su, Junzhe Li, Chenxiong Qian
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.PL cs.SE
\\
  Fuzzing is effective for vulnerability discovery but struggles with complex
targets such as compilers, interpreters, and database engines, which accept
textual input that must satisfy intricate syntactic and semantic constraints.
Although language models (LMs) have attracted interest for this task due to
their vast latent knowledge and reasoning potential, their practical adoption
has been limited. The major challenges stem from insufficient exploration of
deep program logic among real-world codebases, and the high cost of leveraging
larger models. To overcome these challenges, we propose R1-Fuzz, the first
framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to specialize
cost-efficient LMs and integrate them for complex textual fuzzing input
generation. R1-Fuzz introduces two key designs: coverage-slicing-based question
construction and a distance-based reward calculation. Through RL-based
post-training of a model with our constructed dataset, R1-Fuzz designs a
fuzzing workflow that tightly integrates LMs to reason deep program semantics
during fuzzing. Evaluations on diverse real-world targets show that our design
enables a small model, named R1-Fuzz-7B, to rival or even outperform much
larger models in real-world fuzzing. Notably, R1-Fuzz achieves up to 75\%
higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers and discovers 29 previously
unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating its practicality.

Title: Dynamic ReAct: Scalable Tool Selection for Large-Scale MCP Environments
Authors: Nishant Gaurav, Adit Akarsh, Ankit Ranjan, Manoj Bajaj
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.IR
\\
  We present Dynamic ReAct, a novel approach for enabling ReAct agents to ef-
ficiently operate with extensive Model Control Protocol (MCP) tool sets that
exceed the contextual memory limitations of large language models. Our approach
addresses the fundamental challenge of tool selection in environments
containing hundreds or thousands of available tools, where loading all tools
simultaneously is computationally infeasible. We propose and evaluate five
distinct architectures that progressively refine the tool selection process,
culminating in a search-and-load mechanism that achieves intelligent tool
selection with minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces tool loading by up to 50% while
maintaining task completion accuracy, advancing the path towards truly
general-purpose AI agents capable of dynamically adapting to diverse task
environments.

Title: Can You Trust Your Copilot? A Privacy Scorecard for AI Coding Assistants
Authors: Amir AL-Maamari
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  The rapid integration of AI-powered coding assistants into developer
workflows has raised significant privacy and trust concerns. As developers
entrust proprietary code to services like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and
GitHub Copilot, the unclear data handling practices of these tools create
security and compliance risks. This paper addresses this challenge by
introducing and applying a novel, expert-validated privacy scorecard. The
methodology involves a detailed analysis of four document types; from legal
policies to external audits; to score five leading assistants against 14
weighted criteria. A legal expert and a data protection officer refined these
criteria and their weighting. The results reveal a distinct hierarchy of
privacy protections, with a 20-point gap between the highest- and lowest-ranked
tools. The analysis uncovers common industry weaknesses, including the
pervasive use of opt-out consent for model training and a near-universal
failure to filter secrets from user prompts proactively. The resulting
scorecard provides actionable guidance for developers and organizations,
enabling evidence-based tool selection. This work establishes a new benchmark
for transparency and advocates for a shift towards more user-centric privacy
standards in the AI industry.

Title: The Secret Agenda: LLMs Strategically Lie and Our Current Safety Tools
  Are Blind
Authors: Caleb DeLeeuw, Gaurav Chawla, Aniket Sharma, Vanessa Dietze
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 9 pages plus citations and appendix, 7 figures
\\
  We investigate strategic deception in large language models using two
complementary testbeds: Secret Agenda (across 38 models) and Insider Trading
compliance (via SAE architectures). Secret Agenda reliably induced lying when
deception advantaged goal achievement across all model families. Analysis
revealed that autolabeled SAE features for "deception" rarely activated during
strategic dishonesty, and feature steering experiments across 100+
deception-related features failed to prevent lying. Conversely, insider trading
analysis using unlabeled SAE activations separated deceptive versus compliant
responses through discriminative patterns in heatmaps and t-SNE visualizations.
These findings suggest autolabel-driven interpretability approaches fail to
detect or control behavioral deception, while aggregate unlabeled activations
provide population-level structure for risk assessment. Results span Llama
8B/70B SAE implementations and GemmaScope under resource constraints,
representing preliminary findings that motivate larger studies on feature
discovery, labeling methodology, and causal interventions in realistic
deception contexts.

  and Roman Zhukov
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.CL cs.CR
\\
  This paper introduces the Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC), a novel framework
designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the development and
deployment of AI systems. The HASC builds upon existing model card and system
card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's
security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of
identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement
existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent
communication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of
truth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed
decisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also
compare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and
discuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater
transparency and accountability for AI systems.

the hard challenge of the communication latency overhead across space.
Decentralized architectures are better alternatives in the longer term,

Title: Data-Efficient ASR Personalization for Non-Normative Speech Using an
  Uncertainty-Based Phoneme Difficulty Score for Guided Sampling
Authors: Niclas Pokel, Pehu\'en Moure, Roman Boehringer, Yingqiang Gao
Categories: eess.AS cs.AI cs.SD
\\
  Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with non-normative speech
from individuals with impairments caused by conditions like cerebral palsy or
structural anomalies. The high acoustic variability and scarcity of training
data severely degrade model performance. This work introduces a data-efficient
personalization method that quantifies phoneme-level uncertainty to guide
fine-tuning. We leverage Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate which phonemes a model
finds most difficult and use these estimates for a targeted oversampling
strategy. We validate our method on English and German datasets. Crucially, we
demonstrate that our model-derived uncertainty strongly correlates with
phonemes identified as challenging in an expert clinical logopedic report,
marking, to our knowledge, the first work to successfully align model
uncertainty with expert assessment of speech difficulty. Our results show that
this clinically-validated, uncertainty-guided sampling significantly improves
ASR accuracy, delivering a practical framework for personalized and inclusive
ASR.

Title: Variational Low-Rank Adaptation for Personalized Impaired Speech
  Recognition
Authors: Niclas Pokel, Pehu\'en Moure, Roman Boehringer, Shih-Chii Liu,

Categories: eess.AS cs.AI
\\
  Speech impairments resulting from congenital disorders, such as cerebral
palsy, down syndrome, or apert syndrome, as well as acquired brain injuries due
to stroke, traumatic accidents, or tumors, present major challenges to
automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Despite recent advancements,
state-of-the-art ASR models like Whisper still struggle with non-normative
speech due to limited training data availability and high acoustic variability.
Moreover, collecting and annotating non-normative speech is burdensome:
speaking is effortful for many affected individuals, while laborious annotation
often requires caregivers familiar with the speaker. This work introduces a
novel ASR personalization method based on Bayesian Low-rank Adaptation for
data-efficient fine-tuning. We validate our method on the English UA-Speech
dataset and a newly collected German speech dataset, BF-Sprache, from a child
with structural speech impairment. The dataset and approach are designed to
reflect the challenges of low-resource settings that include individuals with
speech impairments. Our method significantly improves ASR accuracy for impaired
speech while maintaining data and annotation efficiency, offering a practical
path toward inclusive ASR.

Title: Defending against Stegomalware in Deep Neural Networks with Permutation
  Symmetry
Authors: Birk Torpmann-Hagen, Michael A. Riegler, P{\aa}l Halvorsen, Dag
  Johansen
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Deep neural networks are being utilized in a growing number of applications,
both in production systems and for personal use. Network checkpoints are as a
consequence often shared and distributed on various platforms to ease the
development process. This work considers the threat of neural network
stegomalware, where malware is embedded in neural network checkpoints at a
negligible cost to network accuracy. This constitutes a significant security
concern, but is nevertheless largely neglected by the deep learning
practitioners and security specialists alike. We propose the first effective
countermeasure to these attacks. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art
neural network stegomalware can be efficiently and effectively neutralized
through shuffling the column order of the weight- and bias-matrices, or
equivalently the channel-order of convolutional layers. We show that this
effectively corrupts payloads that have been embedded by state-of-the-art
methods in neural network steganography at no cost to network accuracy,
outperforming competing methods by a significant margin. We then discuss
possible means by which to bypass this defense, additional defense methods, and
advocate for continued research into the security of machine learning systems.

  Machine learning-based cybersecurity systems are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) act as both
powerful attack enablers and promising defenses. This survey systematically
reviews GAN-based adversarial defenses in cybersecurity (2021--August 31,
2025), consolidating recent progress, identifying gaps, and outlining future
directions. Using a PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review protocol, we
searched five major digital libraries. From 829 initial records, 185
peer-reviewed studies were retained and synthesized through quantitative trend
analysis and thematic taxonomy development. We introduce a four-dimensional
taxonomy spanning defensive function, GAN architecture, cybersecurity domain,
and adversarial threat model. GANs improve detection accuracy, robustness, and
data utility across network intrusion detection, malware analysis, and IoT
security. Notable advances include WGAN-GP for stable training, CGANs for
targeted synthesis, and hybrid GAN models for improved resilience. Yet,
persistent challenges remain such as instability in training, lack of
standardized benchmarks, high computational cost, and limited explainability.
GAN-based defenses demonstrate strong potential but require advances in stable
architectures, benchmarking, transparency, and deployment. We propose a roadmap
emphasizing hybrid models, unified evaluation, real-world integration, and
defenses against emerging threats such as LLM-driven cyberattacks. This survey
establishes the foundation for scalable, trustworthy, and adaptive GAN-powered
defenses.

  Classification

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 20 pages (14 pages Main text and 6 pages Supplementary Material)
\\
  Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

Title: AI-Specific Code Smells: From Specification to Detection
Authors: Brahim Mahmoudi and Naouel Moha and Quentin Stievenert and Florent
  Avellaneda
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
\\
  The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how software systems
are developed and maintained. However, AI-based systems give rise to new
software issues that existing detection tools often miss. Among these, we focus
on AI-specific code smells, recurring patterns in the code that may indicate
deeper problems such as unreproducibility, silent failures, or poor model
generalization. We introduce SpecDetect4AI, a tool-based approach for the
specification and detection of these code smells at scale. This approach
combines a high-level declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for rule
specification with an extensible static analysis tool that interprets and
detects these rules for AI-based systems. We specified 22 AI-specific code
smells and evaluated SpecDetect4AI on 826 AI-based systems (20M lines of code),
achieving a precision of 88.66% and a recall of 88.89%, outperforming other
existing detection tools. Our results show that SpecDetect4AI supports the
specification and detection of AI-specific code smells through dedicated rules
and can effectively analyze large AI-based systems, demonstrating both
efficiency and extensibility (SUS 81.7/100).

  Prediction with TopoGraph-and-VisitInfo-Aware Prompting
Authors: Boqi Li, Siyuan Li, Weiyi Wang, Anran Li, Zhong Cao, Henry X. Liu
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language
navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad
practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a
particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural
language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions.
We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective
waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor
operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints,
which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with
explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded
into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration
history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for
error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of
41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization
Authors: Luca Serfilippi, Giorgio Franceschelli, Antonio Corradi, Mirco
  Musolesi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

\\
  University research labs often rely on chat-based platforms for communication
and project management, where valuable knowledge surfaces but is easily lost in
message streams. Documentation can preserve knowledge, but it requires ongoing
maintenance and is challenging to navigate. Drawing on formative interviews
that revealed organizational memory challenges in labs, we designed CHOIR, an
LLM-based chatbot that supports organizational memory through four key
functions: document-grounded Q&A, Q&A sharing for follow-up discussion,
knowledge extraction from conversations, and AI-assisted document updates. We
deployed CHOIR in four research labs for one month (n=21), where the lab
members asked 107 questions and lab directors updated documents 38 times in the
organizational memory. Our findings reveal a privacy-awareness tension:
questions were asked privately, limiting directors' visibility into
documentation gaps. Students often avoided contribution due to challenges in
generalizing personal experiences into universal documentation. We contribute
design implications for privacy-preserving awareness and supporting
context-specific knowledge documentation.

Title: Understanding and Improving Adversarial Robustness of Neural
  Probabilistic Circuits
Authors: Weixin Chen, Han Zhao
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: NeurIPS 2025 Camera Ready
\\
  Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

Title: GraspFactory: A Large Object-Centric Grasping Dataset
Authors: Srinidhi Kalgundi Srinivas, Yash Shukla, Adam Arnold, Sachin Chitta
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Robotic grasping is a crucial task in industrial automation, where robots are
increasingly expected to handle a wide range of objects. However, a significant
challenge arises when robot grasping models trained on limited datasets
encounter novel objects. In real-world environments such as warehouses or
manufacturing plants, the diversity of objects can be vast, and grasping models
need to generalize to this diversity. Training large, generalizable
robot-grasping models requires geometrically diverse datasets. In this paper,
we introduce GraspFactory, a dataset containing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps
collectively for the Franka Panda (with 14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85
grippers (with 33,710 objects). GraspFactory is designed for training
data-intensive models, and we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of
one such model trained on a subset of GraspFactory in both simulated and
real-world settings. The dataset and tools are made available for download at
https://graspfactory.github.io/.

\\
  Recent advances in multi-agent systems (MAS) enable tools for information
search and ideation by assigning personas to agents. However, how users can
effectively control, steer, and critically evaluate collaboration among
multiple domain-expert agents remains underexplored. We present Perspectra, an
interactive MAS that visualizes and structures deliberation among LLM agents
via a forum-style interface, supporting @-mention to invite targeted agents,
threading for parallel exploration, with a real-time mind map for visualizing
arguments and rationales. In a within-subjects study with 18 participants, we
compared Perspectra to a group-chat baseline as they developed research
proposals. Our findings show that Perspectra significantly increased the
frequency and depth of critical-thinking behaviors, elicited more
interdisciplinary replies, and led to more frequent proposal revisions than the
group chat condition. We discuss implications for designing multi-agent tools
that scaffold critical thinking by supporting user control over multi-agent
adversarial discourse.

\\
  Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

  Recent developments in Generative AI enable creators to stylize 3D models
based on text prompts. These methods change the 3D model geometry, which can
compromise the model's structural integrity once fabricated. We present
MechStyle, a system that enables creators to stylize 3D printable models while
preserving their structural integrity. MechStyle accomplishes this by
augmenting the Generative AI-based stylization process with feedback from a
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation. As the stylization process modifies
the geometry to approximate the desired style, feedback from the FEA simulation
reduces modifications to regions with increased stress. We evaluate the
effectiveness of FEA simulation feedback in the augmented stylization process
by comparing three stylization control strategies. We also investigate the time
efficiency of our approach by comparing three adaptive scheduling strategies.
Finally, we demonstrate MechStyle's user interface that allows users to
generate stylized and structurally viable 3D models and provide five example
applications.

Title: Every Character Counts: From Vulnerability to Defense in Phishing
  Detection
Authors: Maria Chiper, Radu Tudor Ionescu
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: Accepted at ICTAI 2025
\\
  Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an
increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic
detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new
phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide
both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures
adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and
CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple
sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard
training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial
attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to
develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under
limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to
be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show
vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially
improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able
to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model.

  Traditional approaches to network management have been accessible only to a
handful of highly-trained network operators with significant expert knowledge.
This creates barriers for lay users to easily manage their networks without
resorting to experts. With recent development of powerful large language models
(LLMs) for language comprehension, we design a system to make network
management accessible to a broader audience of non-experts by allowing users to
converse with networks in natural language. To effectively leverage
advancements in LLMs, we propose an agentic framework that uses an intermediate
representation to streamline configuration across diverse vendor equipment,
retrieves the network state from memory in real-time, and provides an interface
for external feedback. We also conduct pilot studies to collect real user data
of natural language utterances for network control, and present a visualization
interface to facilitate dialogue-driven user interaction and enable large-scale
data collection for future development. Preliminary experiments validate the
effectiveness of our proposed system components with LLM integration on both
synthetic and real user utterances. Through our data collection and
visualization efforts, we pave the way for more effective use of LLMs and
democratize network control for everyday users.

Title: MMG: Mutual Information Estimation via the MMSE Gap in Diffusion
Authors: Longxuan Yu, Xing Shi, Xianghao Kong, Tong Jia, Greg Ver Steeg
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Accepted to the SPIGM Workshop at NeurIPS 2025
\\
  Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

Title: Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning for Modeling Heterogeneity in
  Multi-site fMRI Data
Authors: Yipu Zhang, Chengshuo Zhang, Ziyu Zhou, Gang Qu, Hao Zheng, Yuping
  Wang, Hui Shen, Hongwen Deng
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

  Correctional Facilities

  We find AI embeddings obtained using a pre-trained transformer-based Large
Language Model (LLM) of 80,000-120,000 written affirmations and correction
exchanges among residents in low-security correctional facilities to be highly
predictive of recidivism. The prediction accuracy is 30\% higher with embedding
vectors than with only pre-entry covariates. However, since the text embedding
vectors are high-dimensional, we perform Zero-Shot classification of these
texts to a low-dimensional vector of user-defined classes to aid interpretation
while retaining the predictive power. To shed light on the social dynamics
inside the correctional facilities, we estimate peer effects in these
LLM-generated numerical representations of language with a multivariate peer
effect model, adjusting for network endogeneity. We develop new methodology and
theory for peer effect estimation that accommodate sparse networks,
multivariate latent variables, and correlated multivariate outcomes. With these
new methods, we find significant peer effects in language usage for interaction
and feedback.

  Large Language Model Attacks

Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI
deployment, enabling autonomous and semi-autonomous applications across
industries through intuitive language interfaces and continuous improvements in
model development. However, the attendant increase in autonomy and expansion of
access permissions among AI applications also make these systems compelling
targets for malicious attacks. Their inherent susceptibility to security flaws
necessitates robust defenses, yet no known approaches can prevent zero-day or
novel attacks against LLMs. This places AI protection systems in a category
similar to established malware protection systems: rather than providing
guaranteed immunity, they minimize risk through enhanced observability,
multi-layered defense, and rapid threat response, supported by a threat
intelligence function designed specifically for AI-related threats.
  Prior work on LLM protection has largely evaluated individual detection
models rather than end-to-end systems designed for continuous, rapid adaptation
to a changing threat landscape. We present a production-grade defense system
rooted in established malware detection and threat intelligence practices. Our
platform integrates three components: a threat intelligence system that turns
emerging threats into protections; a data platform that aggregates and enriches
information while providing observability, monitoring, and ML operations; and a
release platform enabling safe, rapid detection updates without disrupting
customer workflows. Together, these components deliver layered protection
against evolving LLM threats while generating training data for continuous
model improvement and deploying updates without interrupting production.

  Human-AI collaboration is typically offered in one of two of user control
levels: guidance, where the AI provides suggestions and the human makes the
final decision, and delegation, where the AI acts autonomously within
user-defined constraints. Systems that integrate both modes, common in robotic
surgery or driving assistance, often overlook shifts in user preferences within
a task in response to factors like evolving trust, decision complexity, and
perceived control. In this work, we investigate how users dynamically switch
between higher and lower levels of control during a sequential decision-making
task. Using a hand-and-brain chess setup, participants either selected a piece
and the AI decided how it moved (brain mode), or the AI selected a piece and
the participant decided how it moved (hand mode). We collected over 400
mode-switching decisions from eight participants, along with gaze, emotional
state, and subtask difficulty data. Statistical analysis revealed significant
differences in gaze patterns and subtask complexity prior to a switch and in
the quality of the subsequent move. Based on these results, we engineered
behavioral and task-specific features to train a lightweight model that
predicted control level switches ($F1 = 0.65$). The model performance suggests
that real-time behavioral signals can serve as a complementary input alongside
system-driven mode-switching mechanisms currently used. We complement our
quantitative results with qualitative factors that influence switching
including perceived AI ability, decision complexity, and level of control,
identified from post-game interview analysis. The combined behavioral and
modeling insights can help inform the design of shared autonomy systems that
need dynamic, subtask-level control switches aligned with user intent and
evolving task demands.

  Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

  Recent work shows that one-class learning can detect unseen deepfake attacks
by modeling a compact distribution of bona fide speech around a single
centroid. However, the single-centroid assumption can oversimplify the bona
fide speech representation and overlook useful cues, such as speech quality,
which reflects the naturalness of the speech. Speech quality can be easily
obtained using existing speech quality assessment models that estimate it
through Mean Opinion Score. In this paper, we propose QAMO: Quality-Aware
Multi-Centroid One-Class Learning for speech deepfake detection. QAMO extends
conventional one-class learning by introducing multiple quality-aware
centroids. In QAMO, each centroid is optimized to represent a distinct speech
quality subspaces, enabling better modeling of intra-class variability in bona
fide speech. In addition, QAMO supports a multi-centroid ensemble scoring
strategy, which improves decision thresholding and reduces the need for quality
labels during inference. With two centroids to represent high- and low-quality
speech, our proposed QAMO achieves an equal error rate of 5.09% in In-the-Wild
dataset, outperforming previous one-class and quality-aware systems.

Title: Efficient Construction of Implicit Surface Models From a Single Image
  for Motion Generation

Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

\\
  In speech deepfake detection (SDD), data augmentation (DA) is commonly used
to improve model generalization across varied speech conditions and spoofing
attacks. However, during training, the backpropagated gradients from original
and augmented inputs may misalign, which can result in conflicting parameter
updates. These conflicts could hinder convergence and push the model toward
suboptimal solutions, thereby reducing the benefits of DA. To investigate and
address this issue, we design a dual-path data-augmented (DPDA) training
framework with gradient alignment for SDD. In our framework, each training
utterance is processed through two input paths: one using the original speech
and the other with its augmented version. This design allows us to compare and
align their backpropagated gradient directions to reduce optimization
conflicts. Our analysis shows that approximately 25% of training iterations
exhibit gradient conflicts between the original inputs and their augmented
counterparts when using RawBoost augmentation. By resolving these conflicts
with gradient alignment, our method accelerates convergence by reducing the
number of training epochs and achieves up to an 18.69% relative reduction in
Equal Error Rate on the In-the-Wild dataset compared to the baseline.

  Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

Title: Incorporating LLM Embeddings for Variation Across the Human Genome
Authors: Hongqian Niu, Jordan Bryan, Xihao Li, Didong Li
Categories: stat.AP cs.AI q-bio.GN
\\
  Recent advances in large language model (LLM) embeddings have enabled
powerful representations for biological data, but most applications to date
focus only on gene-level information. We present one of the first systematic
frameworks to generate variant-level embeddings across the entire human genome.
Using curated annotations from FAVOR, ClinVar, and the GWAS Catalog, we
constructed semantic text descriptions for 8.9 billion possible variants and
generated embeddings at three scales: 1.5 million HapMap3+MEGA variants, ~90
million imputed UK Biobank variants, and ~9 billion all possible variants.
Embeddings were produced with both OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large and the
open-source Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B models. Baseline experiments demonstrate high
predictive accuracy for variant properties, validating the embeddings as
structured representations of genomic variation. We outline two downstream
applications: embedding-informed hypothesis testing by extending the
Frequentist And Bayesian framework to genome-wide association studies, and
embedding-augmented genetic risk prediction that enhances standard polygenic
risk scores. These resources, publicly available on Hugging Face, provide a
foundation for advancing large-scale genomic discovery and precision medicine.

Title: Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization For Feasible Robot Motion Generation
  from Video Demonstrations
Authors: Xiaoxiang Dong, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Weiming Zhi
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

Title: RobotDancing: Residual-Action Reinforcement Learning Enables Robust
  Long-Horizon Humanoid Motion Tracking

Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle
because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading
to error accumulation. We propose RobotDancing, a simple, scalable framework
that predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics
discrepancies. The pipeline is end-to-end--training, sim-to-sim validation, and
zero-shot sim-to-real--and uses a single-stage reinforcement learning (RL)
setup with a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. We
evaluate primarily on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and
validate transfer on H1/H1-2. RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy
behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) and deploys zero-shot to hardware with
high motion tracking quality.

  As designers become familiar with Generative AI, a new concept is emerging:
Agentic AI. While generative AI produces output in response to prompts, agentic
AI systems promise to perform mundane tasks autonomously, potentially freeing
designers to focus on what they love: being creative. But how do designers feel
about integrating agentic AI systems into their workflows? Through design
fiction, we investigated how designers want to interact with a collaborative
agentic AI platform. Ten professional designers imagined and discussed
collaborating with an AI agent to organise inspiration sources and ideate. Our
findings highlight the roles AI agents can play in supporting designers, the
division of authority between humans and AI, and how designers' intent can be
explained to AI agents beyond prompts. We synthesise our findings into a
conceptual framework that identifies authority distribution among humans and AI
agents and discuss directions for utilising AI agents in future design
workflows.

Title: Measuring LLM Sensitivity in Transformer-based Tabular Data Synthesis
Authors: Maria F. Davila R and Azizjon Turaev and Wolfram Wingerath
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

Categories: cs.IR cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  In this work, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based system
for provenance analysis of archaeological artifacts, designed to support expert
reasoning by integrating multimodal retrieval and large vision-language models
(VLMs). The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts
and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to
identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by
the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological,
geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications.
We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from
the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces
meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting
points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of
navigating vast comparative corpora.

Title: IConv: Focusing on Local Variation with Channel Independent Convolution
  for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
Authors: Gawon Lee, Hanbyeol Park, Minseop Kim, Dohee Kim, Hyerim Bae
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Submitted to AAAI
\\
  Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

Title: Even More Kawaii than Real-Person-Driven VTubers? Understanding How
  Viewers Perceive AI-Driven VTubers
Authors: Yiluo Wei, Yupeng He, Gareth Tyson
Categories: cs.HC cs.AI cs.CY
\\
  VTubers, digital personas represented by animated avatars, have gained
massive popularity. Traditionally, VTubers are operated and voiced by human
controllers known as Nakanohito. The reliance on Nakanohito, however, poses
risks due to potential personal controversies and operational disruptions. The
emergence of AI-driven VTubers offers a new model free from these human
constraints. While AI-driven VTubers present benefits such as continuous
operation and reduced scandal risk, they also raise questions about
authenticity and audience engagement. Therefore, to gain deeper insights, we
conduct a case study, investigating viewer perceptions of Neuro-sama, the most
popular AI-driven VTuber with 845k followers on Twitch and 753k followers on
YouTube. We analyze 108k Reddit posts and 136k YouTube comments, aiming to
better understand viewer motivations, how AI constructs the virtual persona,
and perceptions of the AI as Nakanohito. Our findings enhance the understanding
of AI-driven VTubers and their impact on digital streaming culture.

  Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

  Semantic communication (SemCom) has the potential to significantly reduce
communication delay in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications within
vehicular networks (VNs). However, the deployment of vehicular SemCom networks
(VN-SemComNets) faces critical trust challenges in information transmission,
semantic encoding, and communication entity reliability. This paper proposes an
innovative three-layer trustworthy VN-SemComNet architecture. Specifically, we
introduce a semantic camouflage transmission mechanism leveraging defensive
adversarial noise for active eavesdropping defense, a robust federated
encoder-decoder training framework to mitigate encoder-decoder poisoning
attacks, and an audit game-based distributed vehicle trust management mechanism
to deter untrustworthy vehicles. A case study validates the effectiveness of
the proposed solutions. Lastly, essential future research directions are
pointed out to advance this emerging field.

Title: Security-aware Semantic-driven ISAC via Paired Adversarial Residual
  Networks
Authors: Yu Liu, Boxiang He, and Fanggang Wang
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  This paper proposes a novel and flexible security-aware semantic-driven
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework, namely security semantic
ISAC (SS-ISAC). Inspired by the positive impact of the adversarial attack, a
pair of pluggable encryption and decryption modules is designed in the proposed
SS-ISAC framework. The encryption module is installed after the semantic
transmitter, adopting a trainable adversarial residual network (ARN) to create
the adversarial attack. Correspondingly, the decryption module before the
semantic receiver utilizes another trainable ARN to mitigate the adversarial
attack and noise. These two modules can be flexibly assembled considering the
system security demands, without drastically modifying the hardware
infrastructure. To ensure the sensing and communication (SAC) performance while
preventing the eavesdropping threat, the above ARNs are jointly optimized by
minimizing a carefully designed loss function that relates to the adversarial
attack power, SAC performance, as well as the privacy leakage risk. Simulation
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ISAC framework in terms
of both SAC and eavesdropping prevention performance.

Title: Verification Limits Code LLM Training

  Gall\'e, and Marzieh Fadaee
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic
data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by
models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously
unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and
diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of
synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification
design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we
verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test
suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while
quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring
relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By
allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,
we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in
pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and
diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary
through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions
and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields
consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as
currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it
cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification
with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break
the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

  End-to-End Policy for Robotic Manipulation

Comments: First two authors contribute equally. Project page:

\\
  End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by
isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end
neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large
VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and
hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

  Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)

and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior

  Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

Title: StyleBench: Evaluating thinking styles in Large Language Models
Authors: Junyu Guo, Shangding Gu, Ming Jin, Costas Spanos, Javad Lavaei
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in

Title: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning under Random Observation Delays
Authors: Armin Karamzade, Kyungmin Kim, JB Lanier, Davide Corsi, Roy Fox
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

Title: On Theoretical Interpretations of Concept-Based In-Context Learning
Authors: Huaze Tang and Tianren Peng and Shao-lun Huang
Categories: cs.IT cs.AI cs.CL math.IT
\\
  In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural
language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the
theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims
to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called
concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on
applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs
well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In
addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by
the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the
prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights
and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover,
the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM
embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally,
several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical
usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.

Title: Improving Early Sepsis Onset Prediction Through Federated Learning
Authors: Christoph D\"using and Philipp Cimiano
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Accepted at the 1st Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for
  Biomedical Data (AIBio) 2025
\\
  Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

Title: Deep Learning for Crime Forecasting: The Role of Mobility at
  Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Scales

Journal-ref: Albors Zumel, A., Tizzoni, M., & Campedelli, G.M. (2025). Deep
  Learning for Crime Forecasting: The Role of Mobility at Fine-grained
  Spatiotemporal Scales. Journal of Quantitative Criminology
DOI: 10.1007/s10940-025-09629-3
\\
  Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

  Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enables organizations to anticipate, detect,
and mitigate evolving cyber threats. Its effectiveness depends on high-quality
datasets, which support model development, training, evaluation, and
benchmarking. Building such datasets is crucial, as attack vectors and
adversary tactics continually evolve. Recently, Telegram has gained prominence
as a valuable CTI source, offering timely and diverse threat-related
information that can help address these challenges. In this work, we address
these challenges by presenting an end-to-end automated pipeline that
systematically collects and filters threat-related content from Telegram. The
pipeline identifies relevant Telegram channels and scrapes 145,349 messages
from 12 curated channels out of 150 identified sources. To accurately filter
threat intelligence messages from generic content, we employ a BERT-based
classifier, achieving an accuracy of 96.64%. From the filtered messages, we
compile a dataset of 86,509 malicious Indicators of Compromise, including
domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs. This approach not only produces a
large-scale, high-fidelity CTI dataset but also establishes a foundation for
future research and operational applications in cyber threat detection.

Title: Flow Matching in the Low-Noise Regime: Pathologies and a Contrastive
  Remedy
Authors: Weili Zeng, Yichao Yan
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

  We experiment with a low-latency, end-to-end voice-to-voice communication
model to optimize it for real-time conversational applications. By analyzing
components essential to voice to voice (V-2-V) system viz. automatic speech
recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and dialog management, our work
analyzes how to reduce processing time while maintaining high-quality
interactions to identify the levers for optimizing V-2-V system. Our work
identifies that TTS component which generates life-like voice, full of emotions
including natural pauses and exclamations has highest impact on Real time
factor (RTF). The experimented V-2-V architecture utilizes CSM1b has the
capability to understand tone as well as context of conversation by ingesting
both audio and text of prior exchanges to generate contextually accurate
speech. We explored optimization of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)
iterations by the TTS decoder which come at a cost of decrease in the quality
of voice generated. Our experimental evaluations also demonstrate that for
V-2-V implementations based on CSM most important optimizations can be brought
by reducing the number of RVQ Iterations along with the codebooks used in Mimi.

  Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA 2025)
\\
  Phishing emails pose a persistent and increasingly sophisticated threat,
undermining email security through deceptive tactics designed to exploit both
semantic and structural vulnerabilities. Traditional detection methods, often
based on isolated analysis of email content or embedded URLs, fail to
comprehensively address these evolving attacks. In this paper, we propose a
dual-path phishing detection framework that integrates transformer-based
natural language processing (NLP) with classical machine learning to jointly
analyze email text and embedded URLs. Our approach leverages the complementary
strengths of semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures
(e.g., DistilBERT) and structural link analysis via character-level TF-IDF
vectorization paired with classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest).
Empirical evaluation on representative email and URL datasets demonstrates that
this combined approach significantly improves detection accuracy. Specifically,
the DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest
notably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs.
The modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble
integration, facilitating real-world adoption. Collectively, our results
highlight the efficacy and practical value of this dual-path approach,
establishing a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution capable of
enhancing email security against contemporary phishing threats.

  Medicine

\\
  The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

Title: FracAug: Fractional Augmentation boost Graph-level Anomaly Detection
  under Limited Supervision
Authors: Xiangyu Dong, Xingyi Zhang, Sibo Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

Title: Rejuvenating Cross-Entropy Loss in Knowledge Distillation for
  Recommender Systems
Authors: Zhangchi Zhu, Wei Zhang
Categories: cs.IR cs.AI
\\
  This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD)
for recommender systems. KD for recommender systems targets at distilling
rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be
computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the
connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when
performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound
of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the
item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our
goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically
demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the
gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated
Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items
given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked
by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy
is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption
of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RCE-KD.

Title: Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language
  Models
Authors: Hakaze Cho, Haolin Yang, Brian M. Kurkoski, Naoya Inoue
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: 36 pages, 41 figures, 3 tables
\\
  Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

\\
  The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

  We address natural language pick-and-place in unseen, unpredictable indoor
environments with AnywhereVLA, a modular framework for mobile manipulation. A
user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task
graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic
mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then
selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For
interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick
and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual
context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs
fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception
and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining
real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static
scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\%$
overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By
combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system
inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task
generalization of language-conditioned manipulation.

  Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing.
Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit
representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages,
making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional
surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely
used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling,
leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a
novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit
functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large
neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the
domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the
encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric
information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving
unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while
maintaining competitive speed.

Title: ExMolRL: Phenotype-Target Joint Generation of De Novo Molecules via
  Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Haotian Guo, Hui Liu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

Title: Automatic Red Teaming LLM-based Agents with Model Context Protocol Tools
Authors: Ping He, Changjiang Li, Binbin Zhao, Tianyu Du, Shouling Ji
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.SE
\\
  The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide
application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions
between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP)
tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into
these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of
tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents.
Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red
teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving
the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool
poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose
AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by
generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool
effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior
of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms,
thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.

Title: Mechanism of Task-oriented Information Removal in In-context Learning
Authors: Hakaze Cho, Haolin Yang, Gouki Minegishi, Naoya Inoue
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: 67 pages, 70 figures, 7 tables
\\
  In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

Title: Predicting LLM Reasoning Performance with Small Proxy Model
Authors: Woosung Koh, Juyoung Suk, Sungjun Han, Se-Young Yun, Jay Shin
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Pre-print
\\
  Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

  Recently, the outstanding performance reached by neural networks in many
tasks has led to their deployment in autonomous systems, such as robots and
vehicles. However, neural networks are not yet trustworthy, being prone to
different types of misbehavior, such as anomalous samples, distribution shifts,
adversarial attacks, and other threats. Furthermore, frameworks for
accelerating the inference of neural networks typically run on rich operating
systems that are less predictable in terms of timing behavior and present
larger surfaces for cyber-attacks.
  To address these issues, this paper presents a software architecture for
enhancing safety, security, and predictability levels of learning-based
autonomous systems. It leverages two isolated execution domains, one dedicated
to the execution of neural networks under a rich operating system, which is
deemed not trustworthy, and one responsible for running safety-critical
functions, possibly under a different operating system capable of handling
real-time constraints.
  Both domains are hosted on the same computing platform and isolated through a
type-1 real-time hypervisor enabling fast and predictable inter-domain
communication to exchange real-time data. The two domains cooperate to provide
a fail-safe mechanism based on a safety monitor, which oversees the state of
the system and switches to a simpler but safer backup module, hosted in the
safety-critical domain, whenever its behavior is considered untrustworthy.
  The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated by a set of
experiments performed on two control systems: a Furuta pendulum and a rover.
The results confirm the utility of the fall-back mechanism in preventing faults
due to the learning component.

Title: Efficient Ensemble Conditional Independence Test Framework for Causal
  Discovery
Authors: Zhengkang Guan, Kun Kuang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

Title: SupCLAP: Controlling Optimization Trajectory Drift in Audio-Text
  Contrastive Learning with Support Vector Regularization
Authors: Jiehui Luo, Yuguo Yin, Yuxin Xie, Jinghan Ru, Xianwei Zhuang, Minghua

Categories: cs.SD cs.AI
\\
  Contrastive language-audio pretraining, which aims to unify multimodal
representations in a shared embedding space, serves as a cornerstone for
building a wide range of applications, from cross-modal retrieval to
cutting-edge multimodal large language models. However, we find that the
perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in
contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary
information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes
optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we
propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an
auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to
harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift.
The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we
explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an
adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its
predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across
classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard
audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results
on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of
our SVR method.

Title: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Enhances Activation Intensity and
  Diversity in the Internal Circuitry of LLMs
Authors: Honglin Zhang, Qianyue Hao, Fengli Xu, Yong Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

Title: ScaleDiff: Scaling Difficult Problems for Advanced Mathematical
  Reasoning

\\
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

Title: TyphoonMLA: A Mixed Naive-Absorb MLA Kernel For Shared Prefix
Authors: Ahmet Caner Y\"uz\"ug\"uler, Ahmet \c{C}elik, Jiawei Zhuang, Lukas
  Cavigelli
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

Title: Best-of-$\infty$ -- Asymptotic Performance of Test-Time Compute
Authors: Junpei Komiyama and Daisuke Oba and Masafumi Oyamada
Categories: stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  We study best-of-$N$ for large language models (LLMs) where the selection is
based on majority voting. In particular, we analyze the limit $N \to \infty$,
which we denote as Best-of-$\infty$. While this approach achieves impressive
performance in the limit, it requires an infinite test-time budget. To address
this, we propose an adaptive generation scheme that selects $N$ based on answer
agreement, thereby efficiently allocating inference-time computation. Beyond
adaptivity, we extend the framework to weighted ensembles of multiple LLMs,
showing that such mixtures can outperform any individual model. The optimal
ensemble weighting is formulated and efficiently computed as a mixed-integer
linear program. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach.

Title: GraphUniverse: Enabling Systematic Evaluation of Inductive
  Generalization
Authors: Louis Van Langendonck, Guillermo Bern\'ardez, Nina Miolane, Pere
  Barlet-Ros
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at
https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.

Title: Cross-Modal Instructions for Robot Motion Generation
Authors: William Barron, Xiaoxiang Dong, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Weiming Zhi
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

Title: Teaching RL Agents to Act Better: VLM as Action Advisor for Online
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Xiefeng Wu, Jing Zhao, Shu Zhang, Mingyu Hu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

Categories: cs.SD cs.AI
\\
  The ultimate goal of expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is to
accurately translate spoken content while preserving the speaker identity and
emotional style. However, progress in this field is largely hindered by three
key challenges: the scarcity of paired speech data that retains expressive
styles, the complexity of multi-stage processing pipelines, and the limited
transfer of translation capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this
work, we address these challenges by introducing UniSS, a novel single-stage
framework for expressive S2ST. Our approach features carefully designed speech
semantic and style modeling, enabling seamless integration with existing
text-based LLM frameworks to develop a unified text-speech language model. To
transfer translation capabilities from text to speech, we propose a cross-modal
chain-of-thought prompting process that progressively aligns audio semantics
with text and ensures style preservation in the decoded results. Furthermore,
we construct and release a large-scale, high-quality expressive S2ST dataset,
UniST, comprising 44.8k hours of data. Experimental results show that UniSS
significantly outperforms previous methods in translation fidelity and speech
quality while preserving voice, emotion, and duration consistency. Our work
establishes a simpler and more effective paradigm for building the next
generation of expressive S2ST systems. Audio samples are available at

  Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training while
keeping raw data decentralized, making it a conduit for leveraging the power of
IoT devices while maintaining privacy of the locally collected data. However,
existing privacy- preserving techniques present notable hurdles. Methods such
as Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Differential
Privacy (DP) often incur high compu- tational costs and suffer from limited

enhancing both privacy and efficiency in FL, including Trusted Execution

(QC), Chaos-Based Encryption (CBE), Neuromorphic Computing (NC), and Swarm
Intelligence (SI). For each paradigm, we assess its relevance to the FL

We conclude by highlighting open challenges and prospective research avenues,
offering a detailed roadmap for advancing secure and scalable FL systems.

Title: LAVA: Explainability for Unsupervised Latent Embeddings
Authors: Ivan Stresec and Joana P. Gon\c{c}alves
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 28 pages, including references and appendix
\\
  Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

Title: GRPO is Secretly a Process Reward Model
Authors: Michael Sullivan
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 14 pages, 6 figures; under review at ICLR 2026
\\
  We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting
automated code review due to their impressive capabilities in context
understanding and reasoning. However, these capabilities are still limited
compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the
training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved
performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared
to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code
review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is
hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This
paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that
trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions
of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured
information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that
frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that
combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning
pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context
knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of
the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset
and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model,
such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art
methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with
its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.

Title: Adoption, usability and perceived clinical value of a UK AI clinical
  reference platform (iatroX): a mixed-methods formative evaluation of
  real-world usage and a 1,223-respondent user survey
Authors: Kolawole Tytler
Categories: cs.HC cs.AI cs.CY cs.IR
\\
  Clinicians face growing information overload from biomedical literature and
guidelines, hindering evidence-based care. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
with large language models may provide fast, provenance-linked answers, but
requires real-world evaluation. We describe iatroX, a UK-centred RAG-based
clinical reference platform, and report early adoption, usability, and
perceived clinical value from a formative implementation evaluation. Methods
comprised a retrospective analysis of usage across web, iOS, and Android over
16 weeks (8 April-31 July 2025) and an in-product intercept survey. Usage
metrics were drawn from web and app analytics with bot filtering. A client-side
script randomized single-item prompts to approx. 10% of web sessions from a
predefined battery assessing usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent.
Proportions were summarized with Wilson 95% confidence intervals; free-text
comments underwent thematic content analysis. iatroX reached 19,269 unique web
users, 202,660 engagement events, and approx. 40,000 clinical queries. Mobile
uptake included 1,960 iOS downloads and Android growth (peak >750 daily active
users). The survey yielded 1,223 item-level responses: perceived usefulness
86.2% (95% CI 74.8-93.9%; 50/58); would use again 93.3% (95% CI 68.1-99.8%;
14/15); recommend to a colleague 88.4% (95% CI 75.1-95.9%; 38/43); perceived
accuracy 75.0% (95% CI 58.8-87.3%; 30/40); reliability 79.4% (95% CI
62.1-91.3%; 27/34). Themes highlighted speed, guideline-linked answers, and UK
specificity. Early real-world use suggests iatroX can mitigate information
overload and support timely answers for UK clinicians. Limitations include
small per-item samples and early-adopter bias; future work will include
accuracy audits and prospective studies on workflow and care quality.

Title: Human-like Navigation in a World Built for Humans

\\
  When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

Title: Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection:
  Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy
Authors: Tian Lan, Hao Duong Le, Jinbo Li, Wenjun He, Meng Wang, Chenghao Liu
  and Chen Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

  Protecting privacy in social graphs requires preventing sensitive
information, such as community affiliations, from being inferred by graph
analysis, without substantially altering the graph topology. We address this
through the problem of \emph{community membership hiding} (CMH), which seeks
edge modifications that cause a target node to exit its original community,
regardless of the detection algorithm employed. Prior work has focused on
non-overlapping community detection, where trivial strategies often suffice,
but real-world graphs are better modeled by overlapping communities, where such
strategies fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formalize
and address CMH in this setting. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) approach that learns effective modification policies, including
the use of proxy nodes, while preserving graph structure. Experiments on
real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing
baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, offering a principled tool for
privacy-preserving graph modification with overlapping communities.

Title: Tree Search for LLM Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yuxiang Ji, Ziyu Ma, Yong Wang, Guanhua Chen, Xiangxiang Chu, Liaoni
  Wu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

Title: Explaining Fine Tuned LLMs via Counterfactuals A Knowledge Graph Driven
  Framework
Authors: Yucheng Wang, Ziyang Chen, Md Faisal Kabir
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 16 pages, 9 figures
\\
  The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

Title: Semantic Edge-Cloud Communication for Real-Time Urban Traffic
  Surveillance with ViT and LLMs over Mobile Networks
Authors: Murat Arda Onsu, Poonam Lohan, Burak Kantarci, Aisha Syed, Matthew
  Andrews, Sean Kennedy
Categories: cs.NI cs.AI
Comments: 17 pages, 12 figures
\\
  Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle
trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras
across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road
conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a
robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface
for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can
interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment
on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM
inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from
edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential
delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we
propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces
transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)
using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into
compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings
are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the
cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to
generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9%
reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy
of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original
cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT
and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic
surveillance.

Title: A Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Model for Multi-Region and
  Multi-Pollutant Air Quality Forecasting
Authors: Junxin Lu, Shiliang Sun
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 25 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based
environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

Title: It's Not You, It's Clipping: A Soft Trust-Region via Probability
  Smoothing for LLM RL
Authors: Madeleine Dwyer, Adam Sobey, Adriane Chapman
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

Title: No Prior, No Leakage: Revisiting Reconstruction Attacks in Trained
  Neural Networks
Authors: Yehonatan Refael, Guy Smorodinsky, Ofir Lindenbaum, Itay Safran
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical
procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved
lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation
Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients
for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With
millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law
of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain
compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune
them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative
Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general
and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant
demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves
state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot
leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site
patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various
patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its
ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be
open-sourced.

  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

  Optimization in Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Zhenpeng Su, Leiyu Pan, Minxuan Lv, Yuntao Li, Wenping Hu, Fuzheng
  Zhang, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

  Short form video platforms are central sites for health advice, where
alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than
adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in
nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority
signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform
corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate
each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative
strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates
automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal
model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong
agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home
settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority
cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with
persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of
mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales
links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel
with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.

Title: CLUE: Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning Framework
Authors: Hang Chen and Jiaying Zhu and Xinyu Yang and Wenya Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

Title: DELTA-Code: How Does RL Unlock and Transfer New Programming Algorithms
  in LLMs?
Authors: Yiyou Sun, Yuhan Cao, Pohao Huang, Haoyue Bai, Hannaneh Hajishirzi,
  Nouha Dziri, Dawn Song
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

  with Channel Constraints
Authors: Jiahao Huo, Shuliang Liu, Bin Wang, Junyan Zhang, Yibo Yan, Aiwei Liu,
  Xuming Hu, Mingxun Zhou
Categories: cs.CR cs.CL
\\
  Semantic-level watermarking (SWM) for large language models (LLMs) enhances
watermarking robustness against text modifications and paraphrasing attacks by
treating the sentence as the fundamental unit. However, existing methods still
lack strong theoretical guarantees of robustness, and reject-sampling-based
generation often introduces significant distribution distortions compared with
unwatermarked outputs. In this work, we introduce a new theoretical framework
on SWM through the concept of proxy functions (PFs) $\unicode{x2013}$ functions
that map sentences to scalar values. Building on this framework, we propose
PMark, a simple yet powerful SWM method that estimates the PF median for the
next sentence dynamically through sampling while enforcing multiple PF
constraints (which we call channels) to strengthen watermark evidence. Equipped
with solid theoretical guarantees, PMark achieves the desired distortion-free
property and improves the robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks. We
also provide an empirically optimized version that further removes the
requirement for dynamical median estimation for better sampling efficiency.
Experimental results show that PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM
baselines in both text quality and robustness, offering a more effective
paradigm for detecting machine-generated text. Our code will be released at
[this URL](https://github.com/PMark-repo/PMark).

  Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

  Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that
limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these
coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and
intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific
item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in
inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a
persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately
undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation
Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within
mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users
to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control
over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support
this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser
Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a
Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly
policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ
simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance
while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and

Title: BlockFUL: Enabling Unlearning in Blockchained Federated Learning
Authors: Xiao Liu, Mingyuan Li, Xu Wang, Guangsheng Yu, Wei Ni, Lixiang Li,

Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) presents significant challenges, as
models grow and evolve with complex inheritance relationships. This complexity
is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and
traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain
records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper,
we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework
with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for
enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces
two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which
can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and
re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning
process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus
operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate
that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead,
thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within
BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2 models.

Title: SceneWeaver: All-in-One 3D Scene Synthesis with an Extensible and

Authors: Yandan Yang, Baoxiong Jia, Shujie Zhang, Siyuan Huang

\\
  Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.

  Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)
DOI: 10.1109/WHISPERS65427.2024.10876524
\\
  We propose a novel approach based on optimal transport (OT) for tackling the
problem of highly mixed data in blind hyperspectral unmixing. Our method
constrains the distribution of the estimated abundance matrix to resemble a
targeted Dirichlet distribution more closely. The novelty lies in using OT to
measure the discrepancy between the targeted and true abundance distributions,
which we incorporate as a regularization term in our optimization problem. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our method through a case study involving an
unsupervised deep learning approach. Our experiments show that the proposed
approach allows for a better estimation of the endmembers in the presence of
highly mixed data, while displaying robustness to the choice of target
abundance distribution.

Title: Beyond Visual Similarity: Rule-Guided Multimodal Clustering with
  explicit domain rules
Authors: Kishor Datta Gupta, Mohd Ariful Haque, Marufa Kamal, Ahmed Rafi Hasan,
  Md. Mahfuzur Rahman, Roy George
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

\\
  Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in
GPS-denied environments. While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme
weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather
operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an
equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm
pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the
graph, and employs separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature
processing. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse
radar data, improving inter-frame correspondence. Experiments on the
open-source dataset and self-collected dataset show Equi-RO outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy and robustness. Overall, our method
achieves 10.7% and 20.0% relative improvements in translation and rotation
accuracy, respectively, compared to the best baseline on the open-source
dataset.

  Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Title: ArtUV: Artist-style UV Unwrapping
Authors: Yuguang Chen and Xinhai Liu and Yang Li and Victor Cheung and Zhuo
  Chen and Dongyu Zhang and Chunchao Guo
Categories: cs.GR cs.CV
\\
  UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various
visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV
unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of
semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An
artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as
overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level
standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and
semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method
for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV
mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and
artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used
to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the
parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method,
along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an
artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves
topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate
ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile
solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering
tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.

  Reinforcement Learning

  and Zhuo Chen and Dongyu Zhang and Chunchao Guo
Categories: cs.GR cs.CV
\\
  Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV
parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe
UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis
and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure
mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To
address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam
generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch
point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological
and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we
fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference
dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses
seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise
preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and
fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency
and visual fidelity.

Title: SLAM-Free Visual Navigation with Hierarchical Vision-Language Perception
  and Coarse-to-Fine Semantic Topological Planning
Authors: Guoyang Zhao, Yudong Li, Weiqing Qi, Kai Zhang, Bonan Liu, Kai Chen,
  Haoang Li, Jun Ma
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

Title: MASt3R-Fusion: Integrating Feed-Forward Visual Model with IMU, GNSS for
  High-Functionality SLAM
Authors: Yuxuan Zhou, Xingxing Li, Shengyu Li, Zhuohao Yan, Chunxi Xia,
  Shaoquan Feng
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

Categories: cs.CE cs.CV cs.LG cs.NA math.NA
\\
  Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich
microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time
horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net
surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and
time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware
padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and
adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short,
small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of
convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional
solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors
typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating
to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to
16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early
step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

Title: FERD: Fairness-Enhanced Data-Free Robustness Distillation
Authors: Zhengxiao Li, Liming Lu, Xu Zheng, Siyuan Liang, Zhenghan Chen,
  Yongbin Zhou, Shuchao Pang
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

  Prediction

Comments: NeurIPS 2025, Project Page: https://jblei.site/proj/armesh
\\
  Directly generating 3D meshes, the default representation for 3D shapes in
the graphics industry, using auto-regressive (AR) models has become popular
these days, thanks to their sharpness, compactness in the generated results,
and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative
models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which
does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent
with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images,
such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating
meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically,
we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to
build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we
generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR
model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of
level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and
gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology
is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel
progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over
generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive
process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing.

  Models

Categories: cs.GR cs.CV cs.MM
\\
  Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as
a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged
virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable
immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing
accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture
in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However,
existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on
hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across
diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal
architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable
data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA
annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of
approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a
multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia
Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel
coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic
segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural
images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose
an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate
reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated
images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis
annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to
provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We
perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone
,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.

  and Multi-Objective Policy Refinement
Authors: Jianbo Zhao, Taiyu Ban, Xiangjie Li, Xingtai Gui, Hangning Zhou, Lei
  Liu, Hongwei Zhao, Bin Li
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

Title: KeyWorld: Key Frame Reasoning Enables Effective and Efficient World
  Models
Authors: Sibo Li, Qianyue Hao, Yu Shang, Yong Li
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

  We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework
for anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on
realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime
hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that
challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh
modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and
unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible
control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points
represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric
parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both
artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this
representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that
effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By
interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential "hair language", our
autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle
topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate
both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct
AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with
separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and
generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime
hairstyle modeling. Project page: https://hyzcluster.github.io/charm/

  Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

Title: A Unified Framework for Diffusion Model Unlearning with f-Divergence
Authors: Nicola Novello and Federico Fontana and Luigi Cinque and Deniz Gunduz
  and Andrea M. Tonello
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Title: Differential-Integral Neural Operator for Long-Term Turbulence
  Forecasting
Authors: Hao Wu, Yuan Gao, Fan Xu, Fan Zhang, Qingsong Wen, Kun Wang, Xiaomeng
  Huang, Xian Wu
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Title: A Theory of Multi-Agent Generative Flow Networks
Authors: Leo Maxime Brunswic, Haozhi Wang, Shuang Luo, Jianye Hao, Amir Rasouli
  and Yinchuan Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC
Comments: Accepted at SPIGM Workshop NeurIPS 2025
\\
  Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

Title: Guiding Application Users via Estimation of Computational Resources for
  Massively Parallel Chemistry Computations
Authors: Tanzila Tabassum, Omer Subasi, Ajay Panyala, Epiya Ebiapia, Gerald
  Baumgartner, Erdal Mutlu, P. (Saday) Sadayappan, Karol Kowalski
Categories: cs.LG cs.CE cs.DC
\\
  In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

  In this paper, we propose RecIS, a unified Sparse-Dense training framework
designed to achieve two primary goals: 1. Unified Framework To create a Unified
sparse-dense training framework based on the PyTorch ecosystem that meets the
training needs of industrial-grade recommendation models that integrated with
large models. 2.System Optimization To optimize the sparse component, offering
superior efficiency over the TensorFlow-based recommendation models. The dense
component, meanwhile, leverages existing optimization technologies within the
PyTorch ecosystem. Currently, RecIS is being used in Alibaba for numerous
large-model enhanced recommendation training tasks, and some traditional sparse
models have also begun training in it.

Title: Go With The Flow: Churn-Tolerant Decentralized Training of Large
  Language Models
Authors: Nikolay Blagoev, Bart Cox, J\'er\'emie Decouchant, Lydia Y. Chen
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC
\\
  Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

Title: SuperOffload: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale LLM Training on
  Superchips
Authors: Xinyu Lian, Masahiro Tanaka, Olatunji Ruwase, Minjia Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC
Comments: 16 pages, 15 figures
\\
  The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

Title: A Category Theoretic Approach to Approximate Game Theory
Authors: Neil Ghani (MSP Group, University of Strathclyde)
Categories: cs.GT cs.LO cs.MA cs.SC
Comments: In Proceedings ACT 2024, arXiv:2509.18357
Journal-ref: EPTCS 429, 2025, pp. 190-202
DOI: 10.4204/EPTCS.429.10
\\
  This paper uses category theory to develop an entirely new approach to
approximate game theory. Game theory is the study of how different agents
within a multi-agent system take decisions. At its core, game theory asks what
an optimal decision is in a given scenario. Thus approximate game theory asks
what is an approximately optimal decision in a given scenario. This is
important in practice as -- just like in much of computing -- exact answers
maybe too difficult to compute or even impossible to compute given inherent
uncertainty in input.
  We consider first "Selection Functions" which are functions and develop a
simple yet robust model of approximate equilibria. We develop the algebraic
properties of approximation wrt selection functions and also relate
approximation to the compositional structure of selection functions. We then
repeat this process successfully for Open Games -- a more advanced model of
game theory.

Title: Study on Locomotive Epidemic Dynamics in a Stochastic Spatio-Temporal
  Simulation Model on a Multiplex Network
Authors: H.M. Shadman Tabib, Jaber Ahmed Deedar, K.M. Ariful Kabir
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.MA
\\
  This study presents an integrated approach to understanding epidemic dynamics
through a stochastic spatio-temporal simulation model on a multiplex network,
blending physical and informational layers. The physical layer maps the
geographic movement of individuals, while the information layer tracks the
spread of knowledge and health behavior via social interactions. We explore the
interplay between physical mobility, information flow, and epidemic outcomes by
simulating disease spread within this dual-structured network. Our model
employs stochastic elements to mirror human behavior, mobility, and information
dissemination uncertainties. Through simulations, we assess the impact of
network structure, mobility patterns, and information spread speed on epidemic
dynamics. The findings highlight the crucial role of effective communication in
curbing disease transmission, even in highly mobile societies. Additionally,
our agent-based simulation allows for real-time scenario analysis through a
user interface, offering insights into leveraging physical and informational
networks for epidemic control. This research sheds light on designing strategic
interventions in complex social systems to manage disease outbreaks.
