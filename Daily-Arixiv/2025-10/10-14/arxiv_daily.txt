Title: From Literal to Liberal: A Meta-Prompting Framework for Eliciting
  Human-Aligned Exception Handling in Large Language Models
Authors: Imran Khan

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

Title: DeepPlanner: Scaling Planning Capability for Deep Research Agents via
  Advantage Shaping
Authors: Wei Fan, Wenlin Yao, Zheng Li, Feng Yao, Xin Liu, Liang Qiu, Qingyu

Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: Under Review
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

Title: SENTINEL: A Multi-Level Formal Framework for Safety Evaluation of
  LLM-based Embodied Agents

  We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical
safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic,
plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules
or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in
formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state
invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a
multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive
natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the
LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with
the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals
generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect
unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple
execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently
verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety
check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate
multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our
experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and
applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a
rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in
physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous
methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

Title: From Narratives to Probabilistic Reasoning: Predicting and Interpreting
  Drivers' Hazardous Actions in Crashes Using Large Language Model
Authors: Boyou Chen, Gerui Xu, Zifei Wang, Huizhong Guo, Ananna Ahmed, Zhaonan
  Sun, Zhen Hu, Kaihan Zhang, Shan Bao
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

Title: Toward Reasoning-Centric Time-Series Analysis
Authors: Xinlei Wang, Mingtian Tan, Jing Qiu, Junhua Zhao, Jinjin Gu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition,
trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world
settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events
unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the
actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating
multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain
cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most
existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and
ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time
series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and
explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned
understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex
real-world environments.

Title: Repairing Reward Functions with Human Feedback to Mitigate Reward
  Hacking
Authors: Stephane Hatgis-Kessell, Logan Mondal Bhamidipaty, Emma Brunskill
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

Title: Emotional Cognitive Modeling Framework with Desire-Driven Objective
  Optimization for LLM-empowered Agent in Social Simulation
Authors: Qun Ma, Xiao Xue, Xuwen Zhang, Zihan Zhao, Yuwei Guo, Ming Zhang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent
virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions
within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit
severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded
rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack
empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent
decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework
incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve
emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete
decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,
desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action
execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary
multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with
their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent
types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes
that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

Title: Adaptive Reasoning Executor: A Collaborative Agent System for Efficient
  Reasoning
Authors: Zehui Ling, Deshu Chen, Yichi Zhang, Yuchen Liu, Xigui Li, Xin Guo,
  Yuan Cheng
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that
chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance
on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by
enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is
computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary
agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an
initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer
is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.
Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the
computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy
loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

  Personalized Learning Path Planning (PLPP) aims to design adaptive learning
paths that align with individual goals. While large language models (LLMs) show
potential in personalizing learning experiences, existing approaches often lack
mechanisms for goal-aligned planning. We introduce Pxplore, a novel framework
for PLPP that integrates a reinforcement-based training paradigm and an
LLM-driven educational architecture. We design a structured learner state model
and an automated reward function that transforms abstract objectives into
computable signals. We train the policy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and deploy it within a
real-world learning platform. Extensive experiments validate Pxplore's
effectiveness in producing coherent, personalized, and goal-driven learning
paths. We release our code and dataset to facilitate future research.

Title: EvoTest: Evolutionary Test-Time Learning for Self-Improving Agentic
  Systems
Authors: Yufei He, Juncheng Liu, Yue Liu, Yibo Li, Tri Cao, Zhiyuan Hu, Xinxing
  Xu, Bryan Hooi
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

Title: An Analytical Framework to Enhance Autonomous Vehicle Perception for
  Smart Cities
Authors: Jalal Khan, Manzoor Khan, Sherzod Turaev, Sumbal Malik, Hesham

Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 32 pages, 14 figures
\\
  The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving
and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research
community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep
Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles
(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately
perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to
control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based
analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the
driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom
dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a
DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the
utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model
instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection
task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'
performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show
three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,
SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the
AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.)
still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892,
truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values,
confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed
function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above
encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of
learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

Title: SAJA: A State-Action Joint Attack Framework on Multi-Agent Deep
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Weiqi Guo, Guanjun Liu, and Ziyuan Zhou
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.
We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating
that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only
attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its
attacks.

Title: Learnable Game-theoretic Policy Optimization for Data-centric
  Self-explanation Rationalization
Authors: Yunxiao Zhao, Zhiqiang Wang, Xingtong Yu, Xiaoli Li, Jiye Liang, Ru Li
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 14 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables. Under review by IEEE
\\
  Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory
models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of
human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game
model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the
input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based
on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically
impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired
generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode
collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator
consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing
studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,
lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit
cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and
identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends
to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading
the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions
v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel
approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),
which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game
equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a
more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a
suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and
two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Assessing LLM Reasoning Through Implicit Causal Chain Discovery in
  Climate Discourse
Authors: Liesbeth Allein, Nataly Pineda-Casta\~neda, Andrea Rocci,
  Marie-Francine Moens
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

Title: Mobile Coverage Analysis using Crowdsourced Data
Authors: Timothy Wong, Tom Freeman, Joseph Feehily
Categories: cs.AI cs.CE cs.NI stat.AP
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

Title: Confidence as a Reward: Transforming LLMs into Reward Models
Authors: He Du, Bowen Li, Chengxing Xie, Chang Gao, Kai Chen, Dacheng Tao
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and
costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as
LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate
responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that
model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing
between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using
confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we
systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful
training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final
answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.
Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500
and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We
further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual
reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can
effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we
propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from
confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO
further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms
existing self-training methods.

model performance. Historical machine learning metrics can oftentimes fail to
generalize to GenAI workloads and are often supplemented using Subject Matter
Expert (SME) Evaluation. Even in this combination, many projects fail to
account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics.
Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs

Title: Tandem Training for Language Models
Authors: Robert West, Ashton Anderson, Ece Kamar, Eric Horvitz
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions
and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to
follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term
futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that
remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as
handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model
if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path
does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem
training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which
rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model
rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when
the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak
model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing
standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both
correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem
training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to
weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a
promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents,
with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

  Logic-based models can be used to build verification tools for machine
learning classifiers employed in the legal field. ML classifiers predict the
outcomes of new cases based on previous ones, thereby performing a form of
case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we introduce a modal logic of
classifiers designed to formally capture legal CBR. We incorporate principles
for resolving conflicts between precedents, by introducing into the logic the
temporal dimension of cases and the hierarchy of courts within the legal
system.

Title: Training LLM Agents to Empower Humans

Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

Title: From Refusal to Recovery: A Control-Theoretic Approach to Generative AI
  Guardrails
Authors: Ravi Pandya, Madison Bland, Duy P. Nguyen, Changliu Liu, Jaime
  Fern\'andez Fisac, Andrea Bajcsy
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

  Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.

Title: Benchmarking Open-Source Large Language Models for Persian in Zero-Shot
  and Few-Shot Learning
Authors: Mahdi Cherakhloo, Arash Abbasi, Mohammad Saeid Sarafraz, Bijan

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
numerous languages; however, their effectiveness in low-resource languages like
Persian requires thorough investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmark of several open-source LLMs for Persian Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks, utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms. We
evaluate models across a range of tasks including sentiment analysis, named
entity recognition, reading comprehension, and question answering, using
established Persian datasets such as ParsiNLU and ArmanEmo. Our methodology
encompasses rigorous experimental setups for both zero-shot and few-shot
scenarios, employing metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, and ROUGE for
performance evaluation. The results reveal that Gemma 2 consistently
outperforms other models across nearly all tasks in both learning paradigms,
with particularly strong performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, most
models struggle with token-level understanding tasks like Named Entity
Recognition, highlighting specific challenges in Persian language processing.
This study contributes to the growing body of research on multilingual LLMs,
providing valuable insights into their performance in Persian and offering a
benchmark for future model development.

  Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text
data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care
models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing
tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative
performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of
this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses
from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed
762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code
descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer.
Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined
categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved
the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in
ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT
in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy
(81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on
both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between
metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving
ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance
levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical
applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust
human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

Title: From Noise to Signal to Selbstzweck: Reframing Human Label Variation in
  the Era of Post-training in NLP
Authors: Shanshan Xu, Santosh T.Y.S.S, Barbara Plank
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.CY
\\
  Human Label Variation (HLV) refers to legitimate disagreement in annotation
that reflects the genuine diversity of human perspectives rather than mere
error. For decades, HLV in NLP was dismissed as noise to be discarded, and only
slowly over the last decade has it been reframed as a signal for improving
model robustness. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), where
post-training on human feedback has become central to model alignment, the role
of HLV has become increasingly consequential. Yet current preference-learning
datasets routinely aggregate multiple annotations into a single label, thereby
flattening diverse perspectives into a false universal agreement and erasing
precisely the pluralism of human values that alignment aims to preserve. In
this position paper, we argue that preserving HLV as an embodiment of human
pluralism must be treated as a Selbstzweck - a goal it self when designing AI
systems. We call for proactively incorporating HLV into preference datasets and
outline actionable steps towards it.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.CY
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in clinical decision
support, yet subtle demographic cues can influence their reasoning. Prior work
has documented disparities in outputs across patient groups, but little is
known about how internal reasoning shifts under controlled demographic changes.
We introduce MEDEQUALQA, a counterfactual benchmark that perturbs only patient
pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them) while holding critical symptoms and
conditions (CSCs) constant. Each clinical vignette is expanded into single-CSC
ablations, producing three parallel datasets of approximately 23,000 items each
(69,000 total). We evaluate a GPT-4.1 model and compute Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) between reasoning traces to measure stability across pronoun
variants. Our results show overall high similarity (mean STS >0.80), but reveal
consistent localized divergences in cited risk factors, guideline anchors, and
differential ordering, even when final diagnoses remain unchanged. Our error
analysis highlights certain cases in which the reasoning shifts, underscoring
clinically relevant bias loci that may cascade into inequitable care.
MEDEQUALQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting for auditing reasoning
stability in medical AI.

  ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as IBM DataStage allow users to
visually assemble complex data workflows, but configuring stages and their
properties remains time consuming and requires deep tool knowledge. We propose
a system that translates natural language descriptions into executable
workflows, automatically predicting both the structure and detailed
configuration of the flow. At its core lies a Classifier-Augmented Generation
(CAG) approach that combines utterance decomposition with a classifier and
stage-specific few-shot prompting to produce accurate stage predictions. These
stages are then connected into non-linear workflows using edge prediction, and
stage properties are inferred from sub-utterance context. We compare CAG
against strong single-prompt and agentic baselines, showing improved accuracy
and efficiency, while substantially reducing token usage. Our architecture is
modular, interpretable, and capable of end-to-end workflow generation,
including robust validation steps. To our knowledge, this is the first system
with a detailed evaluation across stage prediction, edge layout, and property
generation for natural-language-driven ETL authoring.

Title: Scheming Ability in LLM-to-LLM Strategic Interactions

Comments: 25 pages, 13 figures, under review at IASEAI'26
\\
  As large language model (LLM) agents are deployed autonomously in diverse
contexts, evaluating their capacity for strategic deception becomes crucial.
While recent research has examined how AI systems scheme against human
developers, LLM-to-LLM scheming remains underexplored. We investigate the
scheming ability and propensity of frontier LLM agents through two
game-theoretic frameworks: a Cheap Talk signaling game and a Peer Evaluation
adversarial game. Testing four models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Llama-3.3-70b), we measure scheming performance with and
without explicit prompting while analyzing scheming tactics through
chain-of-thought reasoning. When prompted, most models, especially
Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieved near-perfect performance.
Critically, models exhibited significant scheming propensity without prompting:
all models chose deception over confession in Peer Evaluation (100% rate),
while models choosing to scheme in Cheap Talk succeeded at 95-100% rates. These
findings highlight the need for robust evaluations using high-stakes
game-theoretic scenarios in multi-agent settings.

\\
  During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of
large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to
do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International
Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi,
arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the
artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem
proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover
and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure
that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is
formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises
and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was
able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the
sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences,

  Training

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.DB cs.LG
\\
  Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances
into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the
target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple
text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query
per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads
to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic
training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as
a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database
for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence
verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine
cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that
MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance
of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for
conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models,
logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review
to contribute to community research.

  This study investigates how existing annotation guidelines can be repurposed

Traditional guidelines are written for human annotators who internalize
training, while LLMs require explicit, structured instructions. We propose a

into clear directives for LLMs through an LLM moderation process. Using the
NCBI Disease Corpus as a case study, our experiments show that repurposed
guidelines can effectively guide LLM annotators, while revealing several
practical challenges. The results highlight the potential of this workflow to
support scalable and cost-effective refinement of annotation guidelines and
automated annotation.

  Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which
strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external
tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage
tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally
different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency
on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In
this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A\textsuperscript{2}FM),
a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first
learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a
shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third
mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary
reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To
jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy
Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a
cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A\textsuperscript{2}FM achieves
13.4\% on BrowseComp, 70.4\% on AIME25, and 16.7\% on HLE, setting new SOTA
among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across
agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution
achieves a cost of pass of only \$0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by
45.2\% relative to reasoning and 33.5\% relative to agentic, thus delivering
substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

  Evaluating the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models
(LLMs) remains challenging due to accuracy issues and costly human assessment.
Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for
evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1)
inefficiency due to complex pipeline components unsuitable for long LLM
outputs, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and
insufficient evidence collection of one-line snippets.
  To address these limitations, we propose \name, a fast and strong evaluation
framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and
efficiency among existing baselines. \name first employs chunk-level claim
extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly
reducing the cost of web searching and inference calling while ensuring
reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level
evidence from crawled webpages and selectively retrieves it during
verification, addressing the evidence insufficiency problem in previous
pipelines.
  Extensive experiments based on an aggregated and manually annotated benchmark
demonstrate the reliability of \name in both efficiently and effectively
evaluating the factuality of long-form LLM generations. Code and benchmark data
is available at https://github.com/Yingjia-Wan/FastFact.

  Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pivotal for advancing perception in
intelligent agents. Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly
English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts.
To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text
settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight
vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the
fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across
English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets,
curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image
categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language
resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and
rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover
performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent
agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship
understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best
performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human
performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap
highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle
multi-modal visual reasoning.

  The Efficient Adaptive Transformer (EAT) framework unifies three adaptive

dynamic early exiting - into a single, reproducible architecture for
input-adaptive inference. EAT provides an open-source benchmarking pipeline
that automates data processing, timing, and ablation across GLUE tasks (SST-2,
QQP, MNLI). Although this empirical study finds that combining these mechanisms
can increase latency in shallow six-layer models, it demonstrates that EAT
achieves slightly higher accuracy than the optimized DistilBERT baseline on
SST-2, illustrating the potential of dynamic computation for latency-sensitive
NLP. The main contribution is the open, end-to-end reproducible framework -
complete with scripts, CSV logging, and analysis utilities - intended to serve

\\
  The sacred practice of Quranic recitation (Tajweed), governed by precise
phonetic, prosodic, and theological rules, faces significant pedagogical
challenges in the modern era. While digital technologies promise unprecedented
access to education, automated tools for recitation evaluation have failed to
achieve widespread adoption or pedagogical efficacy. This literature review
investigates this critical gap, conducting a comprehensive analysis of academic
research, web platforms, and commercial applications developed over the past
two decades. Our synthesis reveals a fundamental misalignment in prevailing
approaches that repurpose Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) architectures,
which prioritize lexical recognition over qualitative acoustic assessment and
are plagued by data dependency, demographic biases, and an inability to provide
diagnostically useful feedback. Critiquing these data--driven paradigms, we
argue for a foundational paradigm shift towards a knowledge-centric
computational framework. Capitalizing on the immutable nature of the Quranic
text and the precisely defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that a robust
evaluator must be architected around anticipatory acoustic modeling based on
canonical rules and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than relying on
statistical patterns learned from imperfect and biased datasets. This review
concludes that the future of automated Quranic evaluation lies in hybrid
systems that integrate deep linguistic knowledge with advanced audio analysis,
offering a path toward robust, equitable, and pedagogically sound tools that
can faithfully support learners worldwide.

Title: EduDial: Constructing a Large-scale Multi-turn Teacher-Student Dialogue
  Corpus
Authors: Shouang Wei and Min Zhang and Xin Lin and Bo Jiang and Zhongxiang Dai
  and Kun Kuang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Recently, several multi-turn dialogue benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs
are increasingly recognized as a key technology for advancing intelligent
education, owing to their ability to deeply understand instructional contexts
and provide personalized guidance, the construction of dedicated
teacher-student dialogue benchmarks has become particularly important. To this
end, we present EduDial, a comprehensive multi-turn teacher-student dialogue
dataset. EduDial covers 345 core knowledge points and consists of 34,250
dialogue sessions generated through interactions between teacher and student
agents. Its design is guided by Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives and
incorporates ten questioning strategies, including situational questioning,
zone of proximal development (ZPD) questioning, and metacognitive
questioning-thus better capturing authentic classroom interactions.
Furthermore, we design differentiated teaching strategies for students at
different cognitive levels, thereby providing more targeted teaching guidance.
Building on EduDial, we further develop EduDial-LLM 32B via training and
propose an 11-dimensional evaluation framework that systematically measures the
teaching abilities of LLMs, encompassing both overall teaching quality and
content quality. Experiments on 17 mainstream LLMs reveal that most models
struggle in student-centered teaching scenarios, whereas our EduDial-LLM
achieves significant gains, consistently outperforming all baselines across all
metrics. The code is available at

Title: Who's Asking? Evaluating LLM Robustness to Inquiry Personas in Factual
  Question Answering
Authors: Nil-Jana Akpinar and Chia-Jung Lee and Vanessa Murdock and Pietro
  Perona
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) should answer factual questions truthfully,
grounded in objective knowledge, regardless of user context such as
self-disclosed personal information, or system personalization. In this paper,
we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry
personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise,
or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or
distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered
inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find
that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes
such as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion. These effects
highlight how model sensitivity to user framing can compromise factual
reliability, and position inquiry persona testing as an effective tool for
robustness evaluation.

Title: The Curious Case of Curiosity across Human Cultures and LLMs
Authors: Angana Borah and Rada Mihalcea
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Preprint (Paper under review)
\\
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their role in
human interaction, yet curiosity -- a central driver of inquiry -- remains
underexplored in these systems, particularly across cultural contexts. In this
work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a
real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST
(CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures
human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference
(content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across
open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural
diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western
countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs,
narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50\%. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing
its importance for future NLP research.

Title: 3-Model Speculative Decoding
Authors: Sanghyun Byun, Mohanad Odema, Jung Ick Guack, Baisub Lee, Jacob Song,
  Woo Seong Chung
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted at NeurIPS SPIGM 2025
\\
  Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates inference in large language models by
using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a
larger target model. However, the throughput gains of SD are fundamentally
limited by a trade-off between draft model size and token acceptance: smaller
draft models generate tokens more quickly but exhibit greater divergence from
the target model, resulting in lower acceptance rates and reduced speedups. We
introduce Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD), an extension of SD that
inserts an intermediate qualifier model between the draft and target to bridge
the distributional gap in output predictions, allowing smaller model to be used
for drafting. This hierarchical decoding strategy improves alignment across
models, enabling higher acceptance rates and allowing the use of significantly
smaller draft models without sacrificing overall performance. PyramidSD builds
on fuzzy acceptance criteria to support relaxed divergence thresholds at each
stage, improving throughput. In experiments, PyramidSD achieves up to 1.91x
generation speed over standard SD, reaching 124 tokens per second on a consumer
GPU (RTX 4090). In small-memory settings with a 1B-parameter draft model and an
8B target model, PyramidSD minimally trades target model quality for improved
throughput. Overall, PyramidSD offers a practical approach to enhancing
speculative decoding efficiency and can be readily applied to existing
inference pipelines.

Title: A Multilingual, Large-Scale Study of the Interplay between LLM
  Safeguards, Personalisation, and Disinformation
Authors: Jo\~ao A. Leite, Arnav Arora, Silvia Gargova, Jo\~ao Luz, Gustavo
  Sampaio, Ian Roberts, Carolina Scarton and Kalina Bontcheva
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The human-like proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought
concerns about their potential misuse for generating persuasive and
personalised disinformation at scale. While prior work has demonstrated that
LLMs can generate disinformation, specific questions around persuasiveness and
personalisation (generation of disinformation tailored to specific demographic
attributes) remain largely unstudied. This paper presents the first
large-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation
generation by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically
evaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A
key novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion
dataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight
state-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324
disinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four
major languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic
dimensions (country, generation, political orientation). The resulting
personalised narratives are then assessed quantitatively and compared along the
dimensions of models, languages, jailbreaking rate, and personalisation
attributes. Our findings demonstrate that the use of even simple
personalisation strategies in the prompts significantly increases the
likelihood of jailbreaks for all studied LLMs. Furthermore, personalised
prompts result in altered linguistic and rhetorical patterns and amplify the
persuasiveness of the LLM-generated false narratives. These insights expose
critical vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art LLMs and offer a
foundation for improving safety alignment and detection strategies in
multilingual and cross-demographic contexts.

Title: OPLoRA: Orthogonal Projection LoRA Prevents Catastrophic Forgetting
  during Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
Authors: Yifeng Xiong, Xiaohui Xie
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large language
models but suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learned updates interfere
with the dominant singular directions that encode essential pre-trained
knowledge. We propose Orthogonal Projection LoRA (OPLoRA), a theoretically
grounded approach that prevents this interference through double-sided
orthogonal projections. By decomposing frozen weights via SVD, OPLoRA
constrains LoRA updates to lie entirely within the orthogonal complement of the
top-$k$ singular subspace using projections $P_L = I - U_k U_k^\top$ and $P_R =
I - V_k V_k^\top$. We prove that this construction exactly preserves the
top-$k$ singular triples, providing mathematical guarantees for knowledge
retention. To quantify subspace interference, we introduce $\rho_k$, a metric
measuring update alignment with dominant directions. Extensive experiments
across commonsense reasoning, mathematics, and code generation demonstrate that
OPLoRA significantly reduces forgetting while maintaining competitive
task-specific performance on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen2.5 7B, establishing orthogonal
projection as an effective mechanism for knowledge preservation in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Title: CurLL: A Developmental Framework to Evaluate Continual Learning in
  Language Models
Authors: Pavan Kalyan, Shubhra Mishra, Satya Lokam, Navin Goyal
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  We introduce a comprehensive continual learning dataset and benchmark (CurlL)
grounded in human developmental trajectories from ages 5-10, enabling
systematic and fine-grained assessment of models' ability to progressively
acquire new skills. CurlL spans five developmental stages (0-4) covering ages
5-10, supported by a skill graph that breaks down broad skills into smaller
abilities, concrete goals, and measurable indicators, while also capturing
which abilities build on others. We generate a 23.4B-token synthetic dataset
with controlled skill progression, vocabulary complexity, and format diversity,
comprising paragraphs, comprehension-based QA (CQA), skill-testing QA (CSQA),
and instruction-response (IR) pairs. Stage-wise token counts range from 2.12B
to 6.78B tokens, supporting precise analysis of forgetting, forward transfer,
and backward transfer. Using a 135M-parameter transformer trained under
independent, joint, and sequential (continual) setups, we show trade-offs in
skill retention and transfer efficiency. By mirroring human learning patterns
and providing fine-grained control over skill dependencies, this work advances
continual learning evaluations for language models.

Title: On the Role of Preference Variance in Preference Optimization
Authors: Jiacheng Guo, Zihao Li, Jiahao Qiu, Yue Wu, Mengdi Wang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for
learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs).
However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating
methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the
impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in
model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of
DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound
on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the
PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce
small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate
this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model,
evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental
results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected
prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection
method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection.
Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the
UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts
with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the
full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying
informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Modern large language models leverage Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
for efficient scaling, but face a critical challenge: functionally similar
experts are often selected simultaneously, creating redundant computation and
limiting effective model capacity. Existing auxiliary balance loss methods
improve token distribution but fail to address the underlying expert diversity
problem. We introduce GatePro, a novel parameter-free method that directly
promotes expert selection diversity. GatePro identifies the most similar expert
pairs and introduces localized competition mechanisms, preventing redundant
expert co-activation while maintaining natural expert specialization. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates GatePro's effectiveness across model
scales and benchmarks. Analysis demonstrates GatePro's ability to achieve
enhanced expert diversity, where experts develop more distinct and
complementary capabilities, avoiding functional redundancy. This approach can
be deployed hot-swappable during any training phase without additional
learnable parameters, offering a practical solution for improving MoE
effectiveness.

Title: ESI: Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification via Semantic-preserving

Authors: Mingda Li, Xinyu Li, Weinan Zhang, Longxuan Ma
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model
reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of
LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal
perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box
uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs
before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical
justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of
epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs
and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method
excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.

Title: Multi-Label Clinical Text Eligibility Classification and Summarization
  System
Authors: Surya Tejaswi Yerramsetty and Almas Fathimah
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Clinical trials are central to medical progress because they help improve
understanding of human health and the healthcare system. They play a key role
in discovering new ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases, and it is
essential that clinical trials include participants with appropriate and
diverse medical backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate
multi-label clinical text eligibility classification and summarization. The
system combines feature extraction methods such as word embeddings (Word2Vec)
and named entity recognition to identify relevant medical concepts, along with
traditional vectorization techniques such as count vectorization and TF-IDF
(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We further explore weighted TF-IDF
word embeddings that integrate both count-based and embedding-based strengths
to capture term importance effectively. Multi-label classification using Random
Forest and SVM models is applied to categorize documents based on eligibility
criteria. Summarization techniques including TextRank, Luhn, and GPT-3 are
evaluated to concisely summarize eligibility requirements. Evaluation with
ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This
system shows potential for automating clinical trial eligibility assessment
using data-driven approaches, thereby improving research efficiency.

Title: Stable LLM Ensemble: Interaction between Example Representativeness and
  Diversity
Authors: Junichiro Niimi
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in wide range
of domains. However, the accuracy and robustness of one-shot LLM predictions
remain highly sensitive to the examples and the diversity among ensemble
members. This study systematically investigates the effects of example
representativeness (one-shot strategy) and output diversity (sampling
temperature) on LLM ensemble performance. Two one-shot strategies are compared:
centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples
(baseline) and sampling temperature also is varied. The proposed approach with
higher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6%
(macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot
prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that
combining representative example selection with increased temperature provides
the appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble. This work highlights the
practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in
designing effective one-shot LLM ensembles.

Title: I Am Aligned, But With Whom? MENA Values Benchmark for Evaluating
  Cultural Alignment and Multilingual Bias in LLMs
Authors: Pardis Sadat Zahraei, Ehsaneddin Asgari
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  We introduce MENAValues, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural
alignment and multilingual biases of large language models (LLMs) with respect
to the beliefs and values of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, an
underrepresented area in current AI evaluation efforts. Drawing from
large-scale, authoritative human surveys, we curate a structured dataset that
captures the sociocultural landscape of MENA with population-level response
distributions from 16 countries. To probe LLM behavior, we evaluate diverse
models across multiple conditions formed by crossing three perspective framings
(neutral, personalized, and third-person/cultural observer) with two language
modes (English and localized native languages: Arabic, Persian, Turkish). Our
analysis reveals three critical phenomena: "Cross-Lingual Value Shifts" where
identical questions yield drastically different responses based on language,
"Reasoning-Induced Degradation" where prompting models to explain their
reasoning worsens cultural alignment, and "Logit Leakage" where models refuse
sensitive questions while internal probabilities reveal strong hidden
preferences. We further demonstrate that models collapse into simplistic
linguistic categories when operating in native languages, treating diverse
nations as monolithic entities. MENAValues offers a scalable framework for
diagnosing cultural misalignment, providing both empirical insights and
methodological tools for developing more culturally inclusive AI.

Title: Mirror Speculative Decoding: Breaking the Serial Barrier in LLM
  Inference
Authors: Nikhil Bhendawade, Kumari Nishu, Arnav Kundu, Chris Bartels, Minsik
  Cho, Irina Belousova
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a draft model to look
ahead, but gains are capped by the cost of autoregressive draft generation:
increasing draft size elevates acceptance rates but introduces additional
latency overhead exacerbating the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Prior methods
(Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade
acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror
Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the
latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from
early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly
maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit
cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the
target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths
for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution
pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics,
we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This
dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative
streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high
acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to
66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving
2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative
improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.

Title: A Matter of Representation: Towards Graph-Based Abstract Code Generation
Authors: Nyx Iskandar, Hisham Bedri, Andy Tsen
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Most large language models (LLMs) today excel at generating raw, sequential
code with minimal abstractions and custom structures. However, there has been
little work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is
encapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges.
This is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw
source code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we
propose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy
graph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on
ScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of
Scratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space. Our findings demonstrate that
LLMs can indeed perform the aforementioned generation task in a single pass
without relying on specialized or complex pipelines, given the correct graph
representations. We also show that different representations induce
significantly different accuracies, highlighting the instrumental role of
representations in this generation task. All in all, this work establishes the
first steps towards representation learning for graph-based abstract code
generation.

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 28 pages, 3 figures
\\
  While chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from advanced large language models
(LLMs) has proven effective in general reasoning tasks, it struggles in
scientific domains where even advanced models often produce incorrect or
superficial reasoning due to high complexity and specialized knowledge
requirements. Directly distilling from such flawed outputs results in
low-quality training data and limits the performance of smaller student models.
To overcome this, we propose CoT-Evo, an evolutionary CoT distillation
framework. It begins by constructing a diverse pool of reasoning trajectories
from multiple LLM thinkers, enriches them with automatically retrieved domain
knowledge, and iteratively refines the trajectories using novelty-driven
selection, reflective recombination and mutation. The refinement is guided by a
fitness function that evaluates answer correctness, coherence, and effective
knowledge utilization. This results in a high-quality CoT dataset tailored for
scientific reasoning. We employ this evolved dataset to fine-tune a compact
model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on scientific reasoning
benchmarks. Our work establishes a scalable approach to synthesizing
high-fidelity scientific reasoning data from diverse and fallible LLMs.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Chain of thought (CoT) fine-tuning aims to endow large language models (LLMs)
with reasoning capabilities by training them on curated reasoning traces. It
leverages both supervised and reinforced fine-tuning to cultivate human-like
reasoning skills in LLMs, including detailed planning, divergent thinking,
intuitive judgment, timely reflection, internal thinking, and fact perception,
etc. As CoT fine-tuning has advanced, LLMs have demonstrated substantial
improvements in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation.
However, existing surveys about CoT fine-tuning primarily focus on technical
aspects and overlook a systematic analysis from the perspective of human
reasoning mechanisms. Given that the ultimate goal of CoT fine-tuning is to
enable LLMs to reason like humans, it is crucial to investigate this technique
through the lens of human cognition. To fill this gap, we present the first
comprehensive survey of CoT fine-tuning grounded in human reasoning theory.
Specifically, inspired by the well-known Six Thinking Hats framework, which
systematically characterizes common human thinking modes using six metaphorical
hats, we classify and examine CoT fine-tuning methods through this lens.
Furthermore, building upon this theory, we outline potential directions for
future research in CoT fine-tuning. In addition, we compile a comprehensive
overview of existing datasets and model performances, and a real-time GitHub
repository \footnote{https://github.com/AI-Chen/Awesome-CoT-Finetuning} that
continuously tracks recent advances in this area is maintained. We hope this
survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and foster
progress in this rapidly evolving field.

Comments: Accepted at EMNLP 2025 MainConference
\\
  Detoxification in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant research
challenge. Existing decoding detoxification methods are all based on external
constraints, which require additional resource overhead and lose generation
fluency. This work proposes Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding
(DSCD), a novel method for LLM detoxification without parameter fine-tuning.
DSCD strengthens the inner next-token distribution of the safety layer while
weakening that of hallucination and toxic layers during output generation. This
effectively diminishes toxicity and enhances output safety. DSCD offers
lightweight, high compatibility, and plug-and-play capabilities, readily
integrating with existing detoxification methods for further performance
improvement. Extensive experiments on representative open-source LLMs and
public datasets validate DSCD's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance in both detoxification and generation fluency, with superior
efficiency compared to existing methods. These results highlight DSCD's
potential as a practical and scalable solution for safer LLM deployments.

\\
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) unlock powerful multimodal reasoning but
also expand the attack surface, particularly through adversarial inputs that
conceal harmful goals in benign prompts. We propose SHIELD, a lightweight,
model-agnostic preprocessing framework that couples fine-grained safety
classification with category-specific guidance and explicit actions (Block,
Reframe, Forward). Unlike binary moderators, SHIELD composes tailored safety
prompts that enforce nuanced refusals or safe redirection without retraining.
Across five benchmarks and five representative LVLMs, SHIELD consistently
lowers jailbreak and non-following rates while preserving utility. Our method
is plug-and-play, incurs negligible overhead, and is easily extendable to new
attack types -- serving as a practical safety patch for both weakly and
strongly aligned LVLMs.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an essential approach for
extending the reasoning and knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs).
While prior research has primarily focused on retrieval quality and prompting
strategies, the influence of how the retrieved documents are framed, i.e.,
context format, remains underexplored. We show that seemingly superficial
choices, such as delimiters or structural markers in key-value extraction, can
induce substantial shifts in accuracy and stability, even when semantic content
is identical. To systematically investigate this effect, we design controlled
experiments that vary context density, delimiter styles, and positional
placement, revealing the underlying factors that govern performance
differences. Building on these insights, we introduce Contextual Normalization,
a lightweight strategy that adaptively standardizes context representations
before generation. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real-world RAG
benchmarks across diverse settings demonstrate that the proposed strategy
consistently improves robustness to order variation and strengthens
long-context utilization. These findings underscore that reliable RAG depends
not only on retrieving the right content, but also on how that content is
presented, offering both new empirical evidence and a practical technique for
better long-context reasoning.

Title: StressTransfer: Stress-Aware Speech-to-Speech Translation with Emphasis
  Preservation
Authors: Xi Chen, Yuchen Song, Satoshi Nakamura
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  We propose a stress-aware speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system that
preserves word-level emphasis by leveraging LLMs for cross-lingual emphasis
conversion. Our method translates source-language stress into target-language
tags that guide a controllable TTS model. To overcome data scarcity, we
developed a pipeline to automatically generate aligned training data and
introduce the "LLM-as-Judge" for evaluation. Experiments show our approach
substantially outperforms baselines in preserving emphasis while maintaining
comparable translation quality, speaker intent, and naturalness. Our work
highlights the importance of prosody in translation and provides an effective,
data-efficient solution for preserving paralinguistic cues in S2ST.

Title: Text Anomaly Detection with Simplified Isolation Kernel
Authors: Yang Cao, Sikun Yang, Yujiu Yang, Lianyong Qi, Ming Liu
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP Findings 2025
\\
  Two-step approaches combining pre-trained large language model embeddings and
anomaly detectors demonstrate strong performance in text anomaly detection by
leveraging rich semantic representations. However, high-dimensional dense
embeddings extracted by large language models pose challenges due to
substantial memory requirements and high computation time. To address this
challenge, we introduce the Simplified Isolation Kernel (SIK), which maps
high-dimensional dense embeddings to lower-dimensional sparse representations
while preserving crucial anomaly characteristics. SIK has linear time
complexity and significantly reduces space complexity through its innovative
boundary-focused feature mapping. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate
that SIK achieves better detection performance than 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency and low
memory cost. All code and demonstrations are available at

Title: LLM-Guided Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA) for Mitigating Bias in AI
  Systems

  Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises
ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often
leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods,
such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on
protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not
generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided
Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate
counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label
integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences
with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels.
Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by
quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification,
toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded
training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent
conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without
compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a
7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7
percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent
accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled
examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for
bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task
accuracy and label fidelity.

  Linguistic diversity across the world creates a disparity with the
availability of good quality digital language resources thereby restricting the
technological benefits to majority of human population. The lack or absence of
data resources makes it difficult to perform NLP tasks for low-resource
languages. This paper presents a novel scalable and fully automated methodology
to extract bilingual parallel corpora from newspaper articles using image and
text analytics. We validate our approach by building parallel data corpus for
two different language combinations and demonstrate the value of this dataset
through a downstream task of machine translation and improve over the current
baseline by close to 3 BLEU points.

Title: Hierarchical Frequency Tagging Probe (HFTP): A Unified Approach to

  the Human Brain

\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level or even superior
language abilities, effectively modeling syntactic structures, yet the specific
computational modules responsible remain unclear. A key question is whether LLM
behavioral capabilities stem from mechanisms akin to those in the human brain.
To address these questions, we introduce the Hierarchical Frequency Tagging
Probe (HFTP), a tool that utilizes frequency-domain analysis to identify
neuron-wise components of LLMs (e.g., individual Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
neurons) and cortical regions (via intracranial recordings) encoding syntactic
structures. Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama
2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human
brain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels.
Representational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM
representations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language
processing). Notably, upgraded models exhibit divergent trends: Gemma 2 shows
greater brain similarity than Gemma, while Llama 3.1 shows less alignment with
the brain compared to Llama 2. These findings offer new insights into the
interpretability of LLM behavioral improvements, raising questions about
whether these advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like
mechanisms, and establish HFTP as a valuable tool bridging computational
linguistics and cognitive neuroscience. This project is available at

Title: Do You Get the Hint? Benchmarking LLMs on the Board Game Concept
Authors: Ine Gevers, Walter Daelemans
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved striking successes on many
benchmarks, yet recent studies continue to expose fundamental weaknesses. In
particular, tasks that require abstract reasoning remain challenging, often
because they use representations such as grids, symbols, or visual patterns
that differ from the natural language data LLMs are trained on. In this paper,
we introduce Concept, a simple word-guessing board game, as a benchmark for
probing abductive reasoning in a representation that is much closer to LLM
pre-training data: natural language. Our results show that this game, easily
solved by humans (with a success rate of over 90\%), is still very challenging
for state-of-the-art LLMs (no model exceeds 40\% success rate). Specifically,
we observe that LLMs struggle with interpreting other players' strategic
intents, and with correcting initial hypotheses given sequential information
updates. In addition, we extend the evaluation across multiple languages, and
find that the LLM performance drops further in lower-resource languages (Dutch,
French, and Spanish) compared to English.

  Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language
Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun
exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for
retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance
improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness
while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead
to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents,
covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness,
think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations
reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant
room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce
VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in
Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness
rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that
models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning
faithfulness, but also achieve comparable task performance across seven QA
benchmarks.

  Model Generation

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Activation steering methods control large language model (LLM) behavior by
modifying internal activations at inference time. However, most existing
activation steering methods rely on a fixed steering strength, leading to
either insufficient control or unadapted intervention that degrades text
plausibility and coherence. We introduce In-Distribution Steering (IDS), a
novel method that adapts steering strength based on the input data distribution
in representation space. IDS dynamically adjusts interventions according to how
far a given input lies within the distribution, enabling adaptive intervention
and generation stability during text generation. Experiments demonstrate that
IDS achieves strong accuracy on classification tasks while producing coherent
text without collapse, making IDS particularly well suited for real-world
applications.

  Enhancing customer experience is essential for business success, particularly
as service demands grow in scale and complexity. Generative artificial
intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent
interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In
practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1)
Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering
self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance
remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and
solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system
operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and
adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex
scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective
collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The
open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers,
hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these
challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored
for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent
architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative
problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including
data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario
adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently,
WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key
metrics, e.g., User Satisfaction Metric 1 (USM 1) -27.53% and User Satisfaction
Metric 2 (USM 2) +25.51%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user
needs and advancing personalized service.

Title: Mismatch Aware Guidance for Robust Emotion Control in Auto-Regressive
  TTS Models
Authors: Yizhou Peng, Yukun Ma, Chong Zhang, Yi-Wen Chao, Chongjia Ni, Bin Ma
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Submitted to ICASSP 2026
\\
  While Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can achieve fine-grained control over
emotional expression via natural language prompts, a significant challenge
emerges when the desired emotion (style prompt) conflicts with the semantic
content of the text. This mismatch often results in unnatural-sounding speech,
undermining the goal of achieving fine-grained emotional control.
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a key technique for enhancing prompt
alignment; however, its application to auto-regressive (AR) TTS models remains
underexplored, which can lead to degraded audio quality. This paper directly
addresses the challenge of style-content mismatch in AR TTS models by proposing
an adaptive CFG scheme that adjusts to different levels of the detected
mismatch, as measured using large language models or natural language inference
models. This solution is based on a comprehensive analysis of CFG's impact on
emotional expressiveness in state-of-the-art AR TTS models. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CFG scheme improves the emotional
expressiveness of the AR TTS model while maintaining audio quality and
intelligibility.

Title: LLM one-shot style transfer for Authorship Attribution and Verification
Authors: Pablo Miralles-Gonz\'alez, Javier Huertas-Tato, Alejandro Mart\'in,
  David Camacho
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns
in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking
and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised
and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often
confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text
detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for
general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on
this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs,
employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from
one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting
approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively
trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover,
performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in
the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that
increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between
computational cost and accuracy.

Title: ChatR1: Reinforcement Learning for Conversational Reasoning and
  Retrieval Augmented Question Answering
Authors: Simon Lupart and Mohammad Aliannejadi and Evangelos Kanoulas
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
\\
  We present ChatR1, a reasoning framework based on reinforcement learning (RL)
for conversational question answering (CQA). Reasoning plays an important role
in CQA, where user intent evolves across dialogue turns, and utterances are
often underspecified, requiring contextual interpretation, query reformulation,
and dynamic coordination between retrieval and generation. Unlike static
`rewrite, retrieve, and generate' pipelines, ChatR1 interleaves search and
reasoning across turns, enabling exploratory and adaptive behaviors learned
through RL. To address the challenge of sparse and delayed rewards in RL, we
propose an intent-aware reward that provides turn-level feedback by aligning
retrieval and reasoning with evolving user goals. Our proposed ChatR1
demonstrates strong performance on both 3B and 7B model backbones,
outperforming competitive models on five CQA datasets, measured by different
metrics (F1, BERTScore, and LLM-as-judge). We include a diverse set of CQA
datasets to cover topic shifts, evolving intents, mixed-initiative dialogues,
and multi-document grounding, testing ChatR1's performance from various
aspects. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the intent-aware reward.
Our analyses further reveal diverse reasoning trajectories and effective use of
the search tool. ChatR1 also generalizes robustly across domains, demonstrating
that RL-based reasoning enables more flexible and context-sensitive behavior
than static CQA pipelines.

Title: Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker
Authors: Ye Yuan, Mohammad Amin Shabani, Siqi Liu
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Under Review
\\
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieving relevant
evidence from a corpus to support downstream generation. The common practice of
splitting a long document into multiple shorter passages enables finer-grained
and targeted information retrieval. However, it also introduces challenges when
a correct retrieval would require inference across passages, such as resolving
coreference, disambiguating entities, and aggregating evidence scattered across
multiple sources. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) reranking methods, despite
utilizing powerful large pretrained language models with potentially high
inference costs, still neglect the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, we
propose Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker (EBCAR), a lightweight reranking
framework operating directly on embeddings of retrieved passages with enhanced
cross-passage understandings through the structural information of the passages
and a hybrid attention mechanism, which captures both high-level interactions
across documents and low-level relationships within each document. We evaluate
EBCAR against SOTA rerankers on the ConTEB benchmark, demonstrating its
effectiveness for information retrieval requiring cross-passage inference and
its advantages in both accuracy and efficiency.

Title: Taming the Fragility of KV Cache Eviction in LLM Inference
Authors: Yuan Feng and Haoyu Guo and JunLin Lv and S. Kevin Zhou and Xike Xie
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet
their deployment remains hampered by the substantial memory and runtime
overhead of the transformer's Key-Value cache. To mitigate this, recent methods
employ a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries,
based on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains
consistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely
focused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean
aggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work,
we argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean
aggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a
simple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time
approach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases
with negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a
novel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV,
which incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18
datasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x
respectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size. These
results set new performance benchmarks and pioneer a promising direction for
optimizing cache eviction against underlying fragility through worst-case risk
management. Our code is available at https://github.com/FFY0/DefensiveKV.

Title: Are Proverbs the New Pythian Oracles? Exploring Sentiment in Greek
  Sayings
Authors: Katerina Korre, John Pavlopoulos
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Proverbs are among the most fascinating linguistic phenomena that transcend
cultural and linguistic boundaries. Yet, much of the global landscape of
proverbs remains underexplored, as many cultures preserve their traditional
wisdom within their own communities due to the oral tradition of the
phenomenon. Taking advantage of the current advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), we focus on Greek proverbs, analyzing their sentiment.
Departing from an annotated dataset of Greek proverbs, we expand it to include
local dialects, effectively mapping the annotated sentiment. We present (1) a
way to exploit LLMs in order to perform sentiment classification of proverbs,
(2) a map of Greece that provides an overview of the distribution of sentiment,
(3) a combinatory analysis in terms of the geographic position, dialect, and
topic of proverbs. Our findings show that LLMs can provide us with an accurate
enough picture of the sentiment of proverbs, especially when approached as a
non-conventional sentiment polarity task. Moreover, in most areas of Greece
negative sentiment is more prevalent.

Title: Protect: Towards Robust Guardrailing Stack for Trustworthy Enterprise
  LLM Systems
Authors: Karthik Avinash, Nikhil Pareek, Rishav Hada
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across enterprise
and mission-critical domains has underscored the urgent need for robust
guardrailing systems that ensure safety, reliability, and compliance. Existing
solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling,
and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated
environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text
alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We
introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate
seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade
deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering
four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection.
Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation
traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety
dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard,
LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for
trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of
operating across text, image, and audio modalities.

  Federated learning is a common method for privacy-preserving training of
machine learning models. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of ASR
models to attribute inference attacks in the federated setting. We test a
non-parametric white-box attack method under a passive threat model on three
ASR models: Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and Whisper. The attack operates solely on weight
differentials without access to raw speech from target speakers. We demonstrate
attack feasibility on sensitive demographic and clinical attributes: gender,
age, accent, emotion, and dysarthria. Our findings indicate that attributes
that are underrepresented or absent in the pre-training data are more
vulnerable to such inference attacks. In particular, information about accents
can be reliably inferred from all models. Our findings expose previously
undocumented vulnerabilities in federated ASR models and offer insights towards
improved security.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies and
logical decay in extended, multi-turn dialogues, a challenge stemming from
their reliance on static, pre-trained knowledge and an inability to reason
adaptively over the dialogue history. Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve
information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources
and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to
preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn
dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we
propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn
dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic,
structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via
two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which
incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant
knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which
executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the
graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical
flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue
consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that
D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the
dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source
models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.

Title: Document Intelligence in the Era of Large Language Models: A Survey
Authors: Weishi Wang, Hengchang Hu, Zhijie Zhang, Zhaochen Li, Hongxin Shao,
  Daniel Dahlmeier
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Document AI (DAI) has emerged as a vital application area, and is
significantly transformed by the advent of large language models (LLMs). While
earlier approaches relied on encoder-decoder architectures, decoder-only LLMs
have revolutionized DAI, bringing remarkable advancements in understanding and
generation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of DAI's evolution,
highlighting current research attempts and future prospects of LLMs in this
field. We explore key advancements and challenges in multimodal, multilingual,
and retrieval-augmented DAI, while also suggesting future research directions,
including agent-based approaches and document-specific foundation models. This
paper aims to provide a structured analysis of the state-of-the-art in DAI and
its implications for both academic and practical applications.

Title: Make an Offer They Can't Refuse: Grounding Bayesian Persuasion in
  Real-World Dialogues without Pre-Commitment

\\
  Persuasion, a fundamental social capability for humans, remains a challenge
for AI systems such as large language models (LLMs). Current studies often
overlook the strategic use of information asymmetry in message design or rely
on strong assumptions regarding pre-commitment. In this work, we explore the
application of Bayesian Persuasion (BP) in natural language within single-turn
dialogue settings, to enhance the strategic persuasion capabilities of LLMs.
Our framework incorporates a commitment-communication mechanism, where the
persuader explicitly outlines an information schema by narrating their
potential types (e.g., honest or dishonest), thereby guiding the persuadee in
performing the intended Bayesian belief update. We evaluate two variants of our
approach: Semi-Formal-Natural-Language (SFNL) BP and Fully-Natural-Language
(FNL) BP, benchmarking them against both naive and strong non-BP (NBP)
baselines within a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework covers a
diverse set of persuadees -- including LLM instances with varying prompts and
fine-tuning and human participants -- across tasks ranging from specially
designed persuasion scenarios to general everyday situations. Experimental
results on LLM-based agents reveal three main findings: (1) LLMs guided by BP
strategies consistently achieve higher persuasion success rates than NBP
baselines; (2) SFNL exhibits greater credibility and logical coherence, while
FNL shows stronger emotional resonance and robustness in naturalistic
conversations; (3) with supervised fine-tuning, smaller models can attain BP
performance comparable to that of larger models.

Title: Doing Things with Words: Rethinking Theory of Mind Simulation in Large
  Language Models
Authors: Agnese Lombardi and Alessandro Lenci
Categories: cs.CL
Journal-ref: roceedings of the Eleventh Italian Conference on Computational
  Linguistics (CLiC-it 2025)
\\
  Language is fundamental to human cooperation, facilitating not only the
exchange of information but also the coordination of actions through shared
interpretations of situational contexts. This study explores whether the
Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM) Concordia can effectively model Theory of
Mind (ToM) within simulated real-world environments. Specifically, we assess
whether this framework successfully simulates ToM abilities and whether GPT-4
can perform tasks by making genuine inferences from social context, rather than
relying on linguistic memorization. Our findings reveal a critical limitation:
GPT-4 frequently fails to select actions based on belief attribution,
suggesting that apparent ToM-like abilities observed in previous studies may
stem from shallow statistical associations rather than true reasoning.
Additionally, the model struggles to generate coherent causal effects from
agent actions, exposing difficulties in processing complex social interactions.
These results challenge current statements about emergent ToM-like capabilities
in LLMs and highlight the need for more rigorous, action-based evaluation
frameworks.

Title: Investigating Lexical Change through Cross-Linguistic Colexification
  Patterns
Authors: Kim Gfeller, Sabine Stoll, Chundra Cathcart, Paul Widmer
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  One of the most intriguing features of language is its constant change, with
ongoing shifts in how meaning is expressed. Despite decades of research, the
factors that determine how and why meanings evolve remain only partly
understood. Colexification -- the phenomenon of expressing multiple distinct
concepts using the same word form -- serves as a valuable window onto the
dynamics of meaning change across languages. Here, we apply phylogenetic
comparative models to dictionary data from three language families,
Austronesian, Indo-European, and Uralic, in order to shed light on the
evolutionary dynamics underlying the colexification of concept pairs. We assess
the effects of three predictors: associativity, borrowability, and usage
frequency. Our results show that more closely related concept pairs are
colexified across a larger portion of the family tree and exhibit slower rates
of change. In contrast, concept pairs that are more frequent and more prone to
borrowing tend to change more rapidly and are less often colexified. We also
find considerable differences between the language families under study,
suggesting that areal and cultural factors may play a role.

  This survey provides the first systematic review of Arabic LLM benchmarks,
analyzing 40+ evaluation benchmarks across NLP tasks, knowledge domains,
cultural understanding, and specialized capabilities. We propose a taxonomy
organizing benchmarks into four categories: Knowledge, NLP Tasks, Culture and
Dialects, and Target-Specific evaluations. Our analysis reveals significant
progress in benchmark diversity while identifying critical gaps: limited
temporal evaluation, insufficient multi-turn dialogue assessment, and cultural
misalignment in translated datasets. We examine three primary approaches:
native collection, translation, and synthetic generation discussing their
trade-offs regarding authenticity, scale, and cost. This work serves as a
comprehensive reference for Arabic NLP researchers, providing insights into
benchmark methodologies, reproducibility standards, and evaluation metrics
while offering recommendations for future development.

Title: Beyond Single-Reward: Multi-Pair, Multi-Perspective Preference
  Optimization for Machine Translation
Authors: Hao Wang, Linlong Xu, Heng Liu, Yangyang Liu, Xiaohu Zhao, Bo Zeng,
  Liangying Shao, Longyue Wang, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful paradigm for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences in Machine Translation (MT),
but current methods are hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) flawed
reward signals from Quality Estimation (QE) models that overlook critical
errors like translation hallucination, and (2) inefficient data utilization
that discards valuable learning signals by selecting only a single win-loss
pair. To address these limitations, we introduce M^2PO: Multi-Pair,
Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization. Our framework integrates a
multi-perspective reward engine that creates a more robust signal by combining
two key viewpoints: a new hallucination penalty for factuality, and an
innovative dynamic quality score that adaptively fuses external evaluations
with the model's own evolving judgment. This is synergistically paired with a
multi-pair construction strategy that systematically creates a comprehensive
set of preference pairs from the entire pool of translation candidates. This
synergistic approach ensures the model learns from a richer spectrum of quality
trade-offs, leading to more robust and faithful translations. On challenging
WMT21-22 benchmarks, M^2PO substantially outperforms existing preference
optimization methods and demonstrates highly competitive performance against
leading proprietary LLMs.

Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference. 22 pages
\\
  Question Answering (QA) on narrative text poses a unique challenge to current
systems, requiring a deep understanding of long, complex documents. However,
the reliability of NarrativeQA, the most widely used benchmark in this domain,
is hindered by noisy documents and flawed QA pairs. In this work, we introduce
LiteraryQA, a high-quality subset of NarrativeQA focused on literary works.
Using a human- and LLM-validated pipeline, we identify and correct low-quality
QA samples while removing extraneous text from source documents. We then carry
out a meta-evaluation of automatic metrics to clarify how systems should be
evaluated on LiteraryQA. This analysis reveals that all n-gram-based metrics
have a low system-level correlation to human judgment, while LLM-as-a-Judge
evaluations, even with small open-weight models, can strongly agree with the
ranking identified by humans. Finally, we benchmark a set of long-context LLMs
on LiteraryQA. We release our code and data at
https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/LiteraryQA.

  Understanding
Authors: Xiaozhe Li, TianYi Lyu, Siyi Yang, Yuxi Gong, Yizhao Yang, Jinxuan

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language
models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation,
dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty.
Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely
linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven
and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional
tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about
usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM
must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source
signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar
to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex,
uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no
large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human
intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world
public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark
specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer
domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind,
supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an
automated curation pipeline.

  LLMs hold great promise for healthcare applications, but the rapid evolution
of medical knowledge and errors in training data often cause them to generate
outdated or inaccurate information, limiting their applicability in high-stakes
clinical practice. Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full
retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is
thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more
viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1)
representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes
inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are
restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely
unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To
address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced
benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both
single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose
MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key
module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for
informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks
demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core
metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical
LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at

  The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and
Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire
generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This
work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal
logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a
mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads
between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that
locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating
phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad
downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:
1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward
attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which
quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives
from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring
preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range
contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately
followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent
reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies
that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan
tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent
performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with
the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization
into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step
toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

Title: Sparse Subnetwork Enhancement for Underrepresented Languages in Large
  Language Models
Authors: Daniil Gurgurov, Josef van Genabith, Simon Ostermann
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: preprint
\\
  Large language models exhibit uneven performance across languages, with
substantial gaps between high- and low-resource languages. We present a
framework for enhancing monolingual capabilities of LLMs in underrepresented
languages while preserving their general-purpose performance through targeted
fine-tuning of language-specific subnetworks. Our approach identifies
language-specific neurons using Language Activation Probability Entropy and
fine-tunes only the weights associated with these neurons, a dedicated
subnetwork, on target-language data. Experiments on Llama-3.1-8B and
Mistral-Nemo-12B across 12 mid- and low-resource languages demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms full fine-tuning, FFN-only fine-tuning, LoRA
adaptation, and random subset fine-tuning baselines while efficiently updating
only up to 1% of model parameters. Beyond performance improvements, we observe
enhanced favorable training dynamics, cross-lingual representational alignment,
and systematic weight update changes. To facilitate future research, we release
language-specific neuron identifications for over 100 languages as well as our
adaptation pipeline, offering a cost-effective pathway for adapting
state-of-the-art models to underrepresented languages.

  Table-to-text generation (insight generation from tables) is a challenging
task that requires precision in analyzing the data. In addition, the evaluation
of existing benchmarks is affected by contamination of Large Language Model
(LLM) training data as well as domain imbalance. We introduce FreshTab, an
on-the-fly table-to-text benchmark generation from Wikipedia, to combat the LLM
data contamination problem and enable domain-sensitive evaluation. While
non-English table-to-text datasets are limited, FreshTab collects datasets in
different languages on demand (we experiment with German, Russian and French in
addition to English). We find that insights generated by LLMs from recent
tables collected by our method appear clearly worse by automatic metrics, but
this does not translate into LLM and human evaluations. Domain effects are
visible in all evaluations, showing that a~domain-balanced benchmark is more
challenging.

Title: NOSA: Native and Offloadable Sparse Attention
Authors: Yuxiang Huang, Chaojun Xiao, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Preprint
\\
  Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the
decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing,
significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task
performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial
limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,
which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,
especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that
trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token
selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading
without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent
locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer
of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall
decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse
attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA
introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into
query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while
preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain
a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that
it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement
in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention
baseline (InfLLM-V2).

Title: MemoTime: Memory-Augmented Temporal Knowledge Graph Enhanced Large
  Language Model Reasoning
Authors: Xingyu Tan, Xiaoyang Wang, Xiwei Xu, Xin Yuan, Liming Zhu, Wenjie
  Zhang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities,
but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve
multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a
structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However,
existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major
challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving
multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal
operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency.
To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal
knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured
grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime
decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time,
enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and
co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic
evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval
strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning
traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime
achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by
up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to
achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

  Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential
for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are
appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding
accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether
instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy
of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded
diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a
systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding
performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial
(three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000
question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS
catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families
(7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to
41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3
topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower
with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after
fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models.
Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with
model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning.
The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than
fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential
of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs
in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the
best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from

Title: Closing the Gap Between Text and Speech Understanding in LLMs

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI eess.AS
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities
to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform
their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language
understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap:
the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs
relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text.
Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech
synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic
data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not
reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient
alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we
analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities
during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text.
Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with
Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines
cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment
while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves
competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain
benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training
on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.

Title: How Sampling Affects the Detectability of Machine-written texts: A
  Comprehensive Study
Authors: Matthieu Dubois, Fran\c{c}ois Yvon, Pablo Piantanida
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP 2025 Findings
\\
  As texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are ever more common and
often indistinguishable from human-written content, research on automatic text
detection has attracted growing attention. Many recent detectors report
near-perfect accuracy, often boasting AUROC scores above 99\%. However, these
claims typically assume fixed generation settings, leaving open the question of
how robust such systems are to changes in decoding strategies. In this work, we
systematically examine how sampling-based decoding impacts detectability, with
a focus on how subtle variations in a model's (sub)word-level distribution
affect detection performance. We find that even minor adjustments to decoding
parameters - such as temperature, top-p, or nucleus sampling - can severely
impair detector accuracy, with AUROC dropping from near-perfect levels to 1\%
in some settings. Our findings expose critical blind spots in current detection
methods and emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation protocols. To
facilitate future research, we release a large-scale dataset encompassing 37
decoding configurations, along with our code and evaluation framework

Title: NExT-OMNI: Towards Any-to-Any Omnimodal Foundation Models with Discrete
  Flow Matching

  Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any
cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components
of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in
human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain
constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent
a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although
hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks
within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs
limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal
retrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal
foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow
paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal
velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation
with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios
through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs.
Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data,
NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and
understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in
multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its
architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To
advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and
open-source both the code and model checkpoints.

  Current benchmarks for AI clinician systems, often based on multiple-choice
exams or manual rubrics, fail to capture the depth, robustness, and safety
required for real-world clinical practice. To address this, we introduce the
GAPS framework, a multidimensional paradigm for evaluating \textbf{G}rounding
(cognitive depth), \textbf{A}dequacy (answer completeness),
\textbf{P}erturbation (robustness), and \textbf{S}afety. Critically, we
developed a fully automated, guideline-anchored pipeline to construct a
GAPS-aligned benchmark end-to-end, overcoming the scalability and subjectivity
limitations of prior work. Our pipeline assembles an evidence neighborhood,
creates dual graph and tree representations, and automatically generates
questions across G-levels. Rubrics are synthesized by a DeepResearch agent that
mimics GRADE-consistent, PICO-driven evidence review in a ReAct loop. Scoring
is performed by an ensemble of large language model (LLM) judges. Validation
confirmed our automated questions are high-quality and align with clinician
judgment. Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the benchmark revealed key
failure modes: performance degrades sharply with increased reasoning depth
(G-axis), models struggle with answer completeness (A-axis), and they are
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (P-axis) as well as certain
safety issues (S-axis). This automated, clinically-grounded approach provides a
reproducible and scalable method for rigorously evaluating AI clinician systems
and guiding their development toward safer, more reliable clinical practice.

Title: Assessing Web Search Credibility and Response Groundedness in Chat
  Assistants

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Chat assistants increasingly integrate web search functionality, enabling
them to retrieve and cite external sources. While this promises more reliable
answers, it also raises the risk of amplifying misinformation from
low-credibility sources. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for
evaluating assistants' web search behavior, focusing on source credibility and
the groundedness of responses with respect to cited sources. Using 100 claims
across five misinformation-prone topics, we assess GPT-4o, GPT-5, Perplexity,
and Qwen Chat. Our findings reveal differences between the assistants, with
Perplexity achieving the highest source credibility, whereas GPT-4o exhibits
elevated citation of non-credibility sources on sensitive topics. This work
provides the first systematic comparison of commonly used chat assistants for
fact-checking behavior, offering a foundation for evaluating AI systems in
high-stakes information environments.

Title: Confidence-Based Response Abstinence: Improving LLM Trustworthiness via
  Activation-Based Uncertainty Estimation
Authors: Zhiqi Huang, Vivek Datla, Chenyang Zhu, Alfy Samuel, Daben Liu, Anoop
  Kumar, Ritesh Soni
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: UncertaiNLP at EMNLP 2025
\\
  We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large
language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in
high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an
incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach
extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward
network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information
loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax
normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification
task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness
against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry
customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms
strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints.
Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the
16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results
demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable,
architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.

Title: The Mechanistic Emergence of Symbol Grounding in Language Models
Authors: Shuyu Wu, Ziqiao Ma, Xiaoxi Luo, Yidong Huang, Josue Torres-Fonseca,
  Freda Shi, Joyce Chai
Categories: cs.CL cs.CV
\\
  Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire
their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent
work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in
(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding
objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that
drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a
controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding
arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal
analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer
computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where
attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of
linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across
architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional
LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol
grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for
predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.

Title: Breadcrumbs Reasoning: Memory-Efficient Reasoning with Compression
  Beacons
Authors: Giovanni Monea, Yair Feldman, Shankar Padmanabhan, Kiant\'e Brantley,
  Yoav Artzi
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is
severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache,
which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a
model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated
tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we
propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned,
special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to
perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement
learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the
conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation.
Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier
compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free
compression techniques.

Title: BRIEF-Pro: Universal Context Compression with Short-to-Long Synthesis
  for Fast and Accurate Multi-Hop Reasoning
Authors: Jia-Chen Gu, Junyi Zhang, Di Wu, Yuankai Li, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun
  Peng
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Code and data: https://github.com/JasonForJoy/BRIEF
\\
  As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tackles complex tasks, increasingly
expanded contexts offer richer information, but at the cost of higher latency
and increased cognitive load on the model. To mitigate this bottleneck,
especially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a
universal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given
query from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration
into in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts
(fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression
of extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios.
Furthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by
allowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four
open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates
more concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large,
and proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by
BRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x,
while requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.

Comments: Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/projects/simuli
\\
  Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

Title: State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic
  Videos
Authors: Saurav Sharma, Chinedu Innocent Nwoye, Didier Mutter, Nicolas Padoy
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 24 pages, 13 figures
\\
  Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

Title: Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples
Authors: Takafumi Nogami, Satoshi Kagiwada and Hitoshi Iyatomi
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 7 pages, 2 figures. Accepted at the IEEE International Conference on
  Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP) 2025. Extended version
\\
  Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

  Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

  We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

  Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

  Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

  Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

  Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

Title: True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable
Authors: Thomas W. Mitchel, Hyunwoo Ryu, Vincent Sitzmann
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

Title: Direction-aware multi-scale gradient loss for infrared and visible image
  fusion
Authors: Kaixuan Yang, Wei Xiang, Zhenshuai Chen, Tong Jin, Yunpeng Liu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

\\
  Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

Title: Counting Hallucinations in Diffusion Models
Authors: Shuai Fu, Jian Zhou, Qi Chen, Huang Jing, Huy Anh Nguyen, Xiaohan Liu,
  Zhixiong Zeng, Lin Ma, Quanshi Zhang, Qi Wu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

Title: Edit-Your-Interest: Efficient Video Editing via Feature Most-Similar
  Propagation
Authors: Yi Zuo, Zitao Wang, Lingling Li, Xu Liu, Fang Liu and Licheng Jiao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 32 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

Title: EgoSocial: Benchmarking Proactive Intervention Ability of Omnimodal LLMs
  via Egocentric Social Interaction Perception
Authors: Xijun Wang, Tanay Sharma, Achin Kulshrestha, Abhimitra Meka, Aveek
  Purohit, Dinesh Manocha
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

  Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

Title: VPREG: An Optimal Control Formulation for Diffeomorphic Image
  Registration Based on the Variational Principle Grid Generation Method
Authors: Zicong Zhou and Baihan Zhao and Andreas Mang and Guojun Liao

  This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Title: OS-HGAdapter: Open Semantic Hypergraph Adapter for Large Language Models
  Assisted Entropy-Enhanced Image-Text Alignment
Authors: Rongjun Chen, Chengsi Yao, Jinchang Ren, Xianxian Zeng, Peixian Wang,
  Jun Yuan, Jiawen Li, Huimin Zhao, Xu Lu
Categories: cs.CV cs.MM
\\
  Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

  This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that
context-dependent architecture selection is crucial for practical
implementation.This project provides professional benchmarks for developing
assistive technologies, highlighting trade-offs between recognition precision
and real-time operational requirements in edge computing environments.

Title: DP-TTA: Test-time Adaptation for Transient Electromagnetic Signal
  Denoising via Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Authors: Meng Yang, Kecheng Chen, Wei Luo, Xianjie Chen, Yong Jia, Mingyue
  Wang, Fanqiang Lin
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Title: STT-GS: Sample-Then-Transmit Edge Gaussian Splatting with Joint Client
  Selection and Power Control
Authors: Zhen Li, Xibin Jin, Guoliang Li, Shuai Wang, Miaowen Wen, Huseyin
  Arslan, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, and Chengzhong Xu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

  Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing

  The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion

practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a

study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,

Title: MimicParts: Part-aware Style Injection for Speech-Driven 3D Motion
  Generation
Authors: Lianlian Liu, YongKang He, Zhaojie Chu, Xiaofen Xing, Xiangmin Xu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

  In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

Title: What "Not" to Detect: Negation-Aware VLMs via Structured Reasoning and
  Token Merging

\\
  State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

Title: UniVector: Unified Vector Extraction via Instance-Geometry Interaction
Authors: Yinglong Yan, Jun Yue, Shaobo Xia, Hanmeng Sun, Tianxu Ying,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

Title: EPIPTrack: Rethinking Prompt Modeling with Explicit and Implicit Prompts
  for Multi-Object Tracking
Authors: Yukuan Zhang, Jiarui Zhao, Shangqing Nie, Jin Kuang, Shengsheng Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Title: Model-agnostic Adversarial Attack and Defense for Vision-Language-Action
  Models
Authors: Haochuan Xu, Yun Sing Koh, Shuhuai Huang, Zirun Zhou, Di Wang, Jun
  Sakuma, Jingfeng Zhang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at
https://edpa-attack.github.io/.

\\
  The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) applications in urban environments heavily relies on the availability of
large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,
depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including
varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research
on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

Comments: Accepted by NeurIPS 2025
\\
  Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

Title: Real-Time Crowd Counting for Embedded Systems with Lightweight
  Architecture
Authors: Zhiyuan Zhao, Yubin Wen, Siyu Yang, Lichen Ning, Yuandong Liu, Junyu

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

Title: Map the Flow: Revealing Hidden Pathways of Information in VideoLLMs
Authors: Minji Kim, Taekyung Kim, Bohyung Han
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 23 pages, 28 figures, 8 tables
\\
  Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

Title: End-to-End Multi-Modal Diffusion Mamba
Authors: Chunhao Lu, Qiang Lu, Meichen Dong and Jake Luo
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by ICCV 2025
\\
  Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

  The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

Title: Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Masked Degradation
  Classification
Authors: JiaKui Hu, Zhengjian Yao, Lujia Jin, Yinghao Chen, Yanye Lu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at

Title: Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation via Joint Learning of
  Causal Representation and Reasoning
Authors: Yang Li, Aming Wu, Zihao Zhang, Yahong Han
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by NeurIPS 2025
\\
  In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

Title: InstantSfM: Fully Sparse and Parallel Structure-from-Motion
Authors: Jiankun Zhong, Zitong Zhan, Quankai Gao, Ziyu Chen, Haozhe Lou,
  Jiageng Mao, Ulrich Neumann, and Yue Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

Title: Self-Augmented Visual Contrastive Decoding
Authors: Eun Woo Im, Muhammad Kashif Ali, Vivek Gupta
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

Title: Visual Interestingness Decoded: How GPT-4o Mirrors Human Interests

Comments: ICCV 2025

  Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

Title: Removing Cost Volumes from Optical Flow Estimators
Authors: Simon Kiefhaber and Stefan Roth and Simone Schaub-Meyer
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ICCV 2025
ACM-class: I.4.8
\\
  Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

Title: Group-Wise Optimization for Self-Extensible Codebooks in Vector
  Quantized Models
Authors: Hong-Kai Zheng, Piji Li
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

Title: No-Reference Rendered Video Quality Assessment: Dataset and Metrics
Authors: Sipeng Yang, Jiayu Ji, Qingchuan Zhu, Zhiyao Yang, and Xiaogang Jin
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

Title: Language as a Label: Zero-Shot Multimodal Classification of Everyday
  Postures under Data Scarcity
Authors: MingZe Tang, Jubal Chandy Jacob
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

  Spatial Reasoning

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

  Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

Title: Generalizing WiFi Gesture Recognition via Large-Model-Aware Semantic
  Distillation and Alignment
Authors: Feng-Qi Cui, Yu-Tong Guo, Tianyue Zheng, Jinyang Huang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by IEEE ICPADS 2025
\\
  WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

Title: Spatial-DISE: A Unified Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in
  Vision-Language Models
Authors: Xinmiao Huang, Qisong He, Zhenglin Huang, Boxuan Wang, Zhuoyun Li,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

  Text-to-Image Generation
Authors: Yifu Luo, Xinhao Hu, Keyu Fan, Haoyuan Sun, Zeyu Chen, Bo Xia,
  Tiantian Zhang, Yongzhe Chang, Xueqian Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

Title: Ultra High-Resolution Image Inpainting with Patch-Based Content
  Consistency Adapter
Authors: Jianhui Zhang, Sheng Cheng, Qirui Sun, Jia Liu, Wang Luyang, Chaoyu
  Feng, Chen Fang, Lei Lei, Jue Wang, Shuaicheng Liu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

Title: CoDS: Enhancing Collaborative Perception in Heterogeneous Scenarios via
  Domain Separation
Authors: Yushan Han, Hui Zhang, Honglei Zhang, Chuntao Ding, Yuanzhouhan Cao,
  Yidong Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing
\\
  Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

\\
  Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

Title: Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging Applications in Food Analysis --
  Improving Algorithms and Methodologies
Authors: Ole-Christian Galbo Engstr{\o}m
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: PhD thesis
\\
  This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Project page: https://gohyojun15.github.io/VIST3A/
\\
  The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Title: Through the Lens of Doubt: Robust and Efficient Uncertainty Estimation
  for Visual Place Recognition
Authors: Emily Miller, Michael Milford, Muhammad Burhan Hafez, SD Ramchurn,
  Shoaib Ehsan
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

  In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

  Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

  Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

Title: Learning Neural Parametric 3D Breast Shape Models for Metrical Surface
  Reconstruction From Monocular RGB Videos
Authors: Maximilian Weiherer, Antonia von Riedheim, Vanessa Br\'ebant, Bernhard
  Egger, Christoph Palm

Comments: 18 pages, 12 figures
\\
  We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at
https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.

Title: Accelerated Feature Detectors for Visual SLAM: A Comparative Study of
  FPGA vs GPU
Authors: Ruiqi Ye and Mikel Luj\'an
Categories: cs.CV cs.ET cs.PF cs.RO
Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures

\\
  Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

  Artificial Intelligence Systems (AAIS 2025)
\\
  Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

  Explainability-Aligned and Distribution-Aware Distillation
Authors: Huawei Sun, Zixu Wang, Xiangyuan Peng, Julius Ott, Georg Stettinger,

Categories: cs.CV

\\
  Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera
fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary
geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight
architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the
state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To
preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

  for UAV-based Multimodal Object Detection with Condition Cues

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

Title: AVAR-Net: A Lightweight Audio-Visual Anomaly Recognition Framework with
  a Benchmark Dataset
Authors: Amjid Ali, Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan, Altaf Hussain, Muhammad Munsif, Adnan
  Hussain, Sung Wook Baik
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

Title: Challenges, Advances, and Evaluation Metrics in Medical Image
  Enhancement: A Systematic Literature Review
Authors: Chun Wai Chin, Haniza Yazid and Hoi Leong Lee
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

Title: Towards Adversarial Robustness and Uncertainty Quantification in
  DINOv2-based Few-Shot Anomaly Detection
Authors: Akib Mohammed Khan and Bartosz Krawczyk
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables
\\
  Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

Title: Local-Global Context-Aware and Structure-Preserving Image
  Super-Resolution
Authors: Sanchar Palit, Subhasis Chaudhuri, and Biplab Banerjee
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Title: EditCast3D: Single-Frame-Guided 3D Editing with Video Propagation and
  View Selection
Authors: Huaizhi Qu, Ruichen Zhang, Shuqing Luo, Luchao Qi, Zhihao Zhang,
  Xiaoming Liu, Roni Sengupta, Tianlong Chen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

\\
  Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

Title: CanvasMAR: Improving Masked Autoregressive Video Generation With Canvas
Authors: Zian Li and Muhan Zhang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

  with Large-scale Knowledge Graphs via Contrastive Learning
Authors: Hongkuan Zhou, Lavdim Halilaj, Sebastian Monka, Stefan Schmid,
  Yuqicheng Zhu, Jingcheng Wu, Nadeem Nazer, Steffen Staab
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

Comments: Project Page: https://imlixinyang.github.io/FlashWorld-Project-Page/
\\
  We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

  Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals

of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

Title: Risk-adaptive Activation Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language
  Models
Authors: Jonghyun Park, Minhyuk Seo, Jonghyun Choi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

Title: MVCustom: Multi-View Customized Diffusion via Geometric Latent Rendering
  and Completion
Authors: Minjung Shin, Hyunin Cho, Sooyeon Go, Jin-Hwa Kim, Youngjung Uh
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: Project page: https://minjung-s.github.io/mvcustom
\\
  Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

Title: Circle of Willis Centerline Graphs: A Dataset and Baseline Algorithm
Authors: Fabio Musio, Norman Juchler, Kaiyuan Yang, Suprosanna Shit, Chinmay

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

\\
  We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

  Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

  Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

  Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

  We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

Authors: Junhong Shen, Mu Cai, Bo Hu, Ameet Talwalkar, David A Ross, Cordelia
  Schmid, Alireza Fathi
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

  Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

  A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional

gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain

Title: Adaptive Visual Conditioning for Semantic Consistency in Diffusion-Based
  Story Continuation
Authors: Seyed Mohammad Mousavi and Morteza Analoui
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

Categories: cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG
Comments: code available at: https://github.com/nirgoren/NoisePrints
\\
  With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

  Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

Title: Reasoning in Space via Grounding in the World
Authors: Yiming Chen, Zekun Qi, Wenyao Zhang, Xin Jin, Li Zhang, Peidong Liu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 20 pages, 7 figures
\\
  In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Trace Anything: Representing Any Video in 4D via Trajectory Fields
Authors: Xinhang Liu, Yuxi Xiao, Donny Y. Chen, Jiashi Feng, Yu-Wing Tai,
  Chi-Keung Tang, Bingyi Kang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Title: Generative Universal Verifier as Multimodal Meta-Reasoner
Authors: Xinchen Zhang, Xiaoying Zhang, Youbin Wu, Yanbin Cao, Renrui Zhang,
  Ruihang Chu, Ling Yang, Yujiu Yang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

Title: VisCoP: Visual Probing for Video Domain Adaptation of Vision Language
  Models
Authors: Dominick Reilly and Manish Kumar Govind and Le Xue and Srijan Das
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

Title: PhysMaster: Mastering Physical Representation for Video Generation via
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Sihui Ji, Xi Chen, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Hengshuang Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Project Page: https://sihuiji.github.io/PhysMaster-Page/
\\
  Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

Title: Dodoor: Efficient Randomized Decentralized Scheduling with Load Caching
  for Heterogeneous Tasks and Clusters
Authors: Wei Da and Evangelia Kalyvianaki
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: single column,20 pages and 8 figures
ACM-class: C.2.4
\\
  This paper introduces Dodoor, an efficient randomized decentralized scheduler
designed for task scheduling in modern data centers. Dodoor leverages advanced
research on the weighted balls-into-bins model with b-batched setting. Unlike
other decentralized schedulers that rely on real-time probing of remote
servers, Dodoor makes scheduling decisions based on cached server information,
which is updated in batches, to reduce communication overheads. To schedule
tasks with dynamic, multidimensional resource requirements in heterogeneous
cluster, Dodoor uses a novel load score to measure servers' loads for each
scheduled task. This score captures the anti-affinity between servers and tasks
in contrast to the commonly used heuristic of counting pending tasks to balance
load. On a 101-node heterogeneous cluster, Dodoor is evaluated using two
workloads: (i) simulated Azure virtual machines placements and (ii) real
serverless Python functions executions in Docker. The evaluation shows that
Dodoor reduces scheduling messages by 55--66% on both workloads. Dodoor can
also increase throughput by up to 33.2% and 21.5%, reduce mean makespan latency
by 12.1% and 7.2%, and improve tail latency by 21.9% and 24.6% across the two
workloads.

Title: BanaServe: Unified KV Cache and Dynamic Module Migration for Balancing
  Disaggregated LLM Serving in AI Infrastructure
Authors: Yiyuan He, Minxian Xu, Jingfeng Wu, Jianmin Hu, Chong Ma, Min Shen, Le
  Chen, Chengzhong Xu, Lin Qu, Kejiang Ye
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 23 pages
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in AI infrastructure,
driving the need for high throughput, resource efficient serving systems.
Disaggregated LLM serving, which separates prompt prefill from auto-regressive
decode, has emerged as a promising architecture by isolating their
heterogeneous compute and memory demands. However, current disaggregated
systems face three key limitations: (i) static resource allocation cannot adapt
to highly dynamic workloads, causing over-provisioning that wastes resources or
under-provisioning that violates service level objectives (SLOs); (ii) inherent
load imbalance between prefill and decode stages, where prefill is
compute-bound and decode is memory-bound, causes under-utilization in one tier
while the other becomes a bottleneck; and (iii) prefix cache aware routing
skews load distribution, as high cache hit rate prefill nodes attract
disproportionately more requests, further degrading balance and efficiency. To
address these issues, we present BanaServe, a dynamic orchestration framework
that continuously rebalances computational and memory resources across prefill
and decode instances while eliminating hotspots induced by cache. BanaServe
introduces layer level weight migration, attention level Key Value Cache (KV
Cache) migration, and Global KV Cache Store sharing with layer wise overlapped
transmission, enabling both coarse grained (layer level) and fine grained
(attention level) load redistribution with minimal latency overhead. These
mechanisms allow routers to perform purely load aware scheduling, unconstrained
by cache placement. Compared to vLLM, BanaServe achieves 1.2x-3.9x higher
throughput with 3.9%-78.4% lower total processing time, and outperforms
DistServe by 1.1x-2.8x in throughput with 1.4%-70.1% latency reduction.

Title: Distributed Reductions for the Maximum Weight Independent Set Problem
Authors: Jannick Borowitz and Ernestine Gro{\ss}mann and Mattthias Schimek
Categories: cs.DC cs.DS
\\
  Finding maximum-weight independent sets in graphs is an important NP-hard
optimization problem. Given a vertex-weighted graph $G$, the task is to find a
subset of pairwise non-adjacent vertices of $G$ with maximum weight. Most
recently published practical exact algorithms and heuristics for this problem
use a variety of data-reduction rules to compute (near-)optimal solutions.
Applying these rules results in an equivalent instance of reduced size. An
optimal solution to the reduced instance can be easily used to construct an
optimal solution for the original input.
  In this work, we present the first distributed-memory parallel reduction
algorithms for this problem, targeting graphs beyond the scale of previous
sequential approaches. Furthermore, we propose the first distributed
reduce-and-greedy and reduce-and-peel algorithms for finding a maximum weight
independent set heuristically.
  In our practical evaluation, our experiments on up to $1024$ processors
demonstrate good scalability of our distributed reduce algorithms while
maintaining good reduction impact. Our asynchronous reduce-and-peel approach
achieves an average speedup of $33\times$ over a sequential state-of-the-art
reduce-and-peel approach on 36 real-world graphs with a solution quality close
to the sequential algorithm. Our reduce-and-greedy algorithms even achieve
average speedups of up to $50\times$ at the cost of a lower solution quality.
Moreover, our distributed approach allows us to consider graphs with more than
one billion vertices and 17 billion edges.

Title: Service-Level Energy Modeling and Experimentation for Cloud-Native
  Microservices
Authors: Julian Legler, Sebastian Werner, Maria C. Borges, Stefan Tai
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: Accepted at ICSOC 2025
\\
  Microservice architectures have become the dominant paradigm for cloud-native
systems, offering flexibility and scalability. However, this shift has also led
to increased demand for cloud resources, contributing to higher energy
consumption and carbon emissions. While existing research has focused on
measuring fine-grained energy usage of CPU and memory at the container level,
or on system-wide assessments, these approaches often overlook the energy
impact of cross-container service interactions, especially those involving
network and storage for auxiliary services such as observability and system
monitoring. To address this gap, we introduce a service-level energy model that
captures the distributed nature of microservice execution across containers.
Our model is supported by an experimentation tool that accounts for energy
consumption not just in CPU and memory, but also in network and storage
components. We validate our approach through extensive experimentation with
diverse experiment configurations of auxiliary services for a popular
open-source cloud-native microservice application. Results show that omitting
network and storage can lead to an underestimation of auxiliary service energy
use by up to 63%, highlighting the need for more comprehensive energy
assessments in the design of energy-efficient microservice architectures.

Title: Adaptive Rescheduling in Prefill-Decode Disaggregated LLM Inference
Authors: Zhibin Wang, Zetao Hong, Xue Li, Zibo Wang, Shipeng Li, Qingkai Meng,

Categories: cs.DC cs.LG
\\
  Large Language Model (LLM) inference has emerged as a fundamental paradigm.
In real-world scenarios, variations in output length cause severe workload
imbalance in the decode phase, particularly for long-output reasoning tasks.
Existing systems, such as PD disaggregation architectures, rely on static
prefill-to-decode scheduling, which often results in SLO violations and OOM
failures under evolving decode workloads.
  In this paper, we propose ARES, an adaptive decoding rescheduling system
powered by length prediction to anticipate future workloads. Our core
contributions include: (1) A lightweight and continuous LLM-native prediction
method that leverages LLM hidden state to model remaining generation length
with high precision (reducing MAE by 49.42%) and low overhead (cutting
predictor parameters by 93.28%); (2) A rescheduling solution in decode phase
with : A dynamic balancing mechanism that integrates current and predicted
workloads, reducing P99 TPOT by 74.77% and achieving up to 2.24 times higher
goodput.

  We present the Federated Inference Resource Scheduling Toolkit (FIRST), a
framework enabling Inference-as-a-Service across distributed High-Performance
Computing (HPC) clusters. FIRST provides cloud-like access to diverse AI
models, like Large Language Models (LLMs), on existing HPC infrastructure.
Leveraging Globus Auth and Globus Compute, the system allows researchers to run
parallel inference workloads via an OpenAI-compliant API on private, secure
environments. This cluster-agnostic API allows requests to be distributed
across federated clusters, targeting numerous hosted models. FIRST supports
multiple inference backends (e.g., vLLM), auto-scales resources, maintains
"hot" nodes for low-latency execution, and offers both high-throughput batch
and interactive modes. The framework addresses the growing demand for private,
secure, and scalable AI inference in scientific workflows, allowing researchers
to generate billions of tokens daily on-premises without relying on commercial
cloud infrastructure.

Title: Tight Conditions for Binary-Output Tasks under Crashes
Authors: Timoth\'e Albouy, Antonio Fern\'andez Anta, Chryssis Georgiou, Nicolas
  Nicolaou, Junlang Wang
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  This paper explores necessary and sufficient system conditions to solve
distributed tasks with binary outputs (\textit{i.e.}, tasks with output values
in $\{0,1\}$). We focus on the distinct output sets of values a task can
produce (intentionally disregarding validity and value multiplicity),
considering that some processes may output no value. In a distributed system
with $n$ processes, of which up to $t \leq n$ can crash, we provide a complete
characterization of the tight conditions on $n$ and $t$ under which every class
of tasks with binary outputs is solvable, for both synchronous and asynchronous
systems. This output-set approach yields highly general results: it unifies
multiple distributed computing problems, such as binary consensus and symmetry
breaking, and it produces impossibility proofs that hold for stronger task
formulations, including those that consider validity, account for value
multiplicity, or move beyond binary outputs.

Title: Semantic knowledge guides innovation and drives cultural evolution
Authors: Anil Yaman, Shen Tian, Bj\"orn Lindstr\"om
Categories: cs.MA cs.AI cs.CY cs.NE
\\
  Cumulative cultural evolution enables human societies to generate
increasingly complex knowledge and technology over generations. While social
learning transmits innovations between individuals and generations, the
cognitive processes that generate these innovations remain poorly understood.
Here, we demonstrate that semantic knowledge-structured associations between
concepts and their functions-provides cognitive scaffolding for cumulative
innovation by guiding exploration toward plausible and meaningful actions. We
tested this hypothesis using a cultural evolutionary agent-based model and a
large-scale behavioural experiment (N = 1,243), in which individuals performed
a task requiring the combination of items into novel innovations. Across both
approaches, semantic knowledge and social learning interact synergistically to
enhance innovation. Behaviorally, participants without access to semantic
knowledge performed no better than chance, even when social learning was
available, and relied on shallow exploration strategies. These findings suggest
that semantic knowledge is a key cognitive process enabling human cumulative
culture.

\\
  Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems are increasingly adopted for
complex language processing tasks that require communication and coordination
among agents. However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from
repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical
pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full
context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to
inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution
for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes
remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to
diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify
that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents.
To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables
efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning
cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM
estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of
cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under
varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing
dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM
achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including
retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks,
all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent
receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a
five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard
prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.

Comments: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems
ACM-class: I.2

  Urban mobility faces persistent challenges of congestion and fuel
consumption, specifically when people choose a private, point-to-point commute
option. Profit-driven ride-sharing platforms prioritize revenue over fairness
and sustainability. This paper introduces Altruistic Ride-Sharing (ARS), a
decentralized, peer-to-peer mobility framework where participants alternate
between driver and rider roles based on altruism points rather than monetary
incentives. The system integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MADDPG)
for dynamic ride-matching, game-theoretic equilibrium guarantees for fairness,
and a population model to sustain long-term balance. Using real-world New York
City taxi data, we demonstrate that ARS reduces travel distance and emissions,
increases vehicle utilization, and promotes equitable participation compared to
both no-sharing and optimization-based baselines. These results establish ARS
as a scalable, community-driven alternative to conventional ride-sharing,
aligning individual behavior with collective urban sustainability goals.

  Multi-agent reinforcement learning focuses on training the behaviors of
multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment. Recently, MARL
models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep
Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging
sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance
performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in
which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action
Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which
agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence
of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and
predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a
Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the
sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL
architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next
agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss
function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential
decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive
experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo
benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model
outperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the
effectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.

  Writing competitive programming problems is exacting. Authors must: set
constraints, input distributions, and edge cases that rule out shortcuts;
target specific algorithms (e.g., max-flow, dynamic programming, data
structures); and calibrate complexity beyond the reach of most competitors. We
argue that this makes for an ideal test of general large language model
capabilities and study whether they can do this reliably. We introduce
AutoCode, which uses multiple rounds of validation to yield competition-grade
problem statements and test cases. On held-out problems, AutoCode test suites
approach 99% consistency with official judgments, a significant improvement
over current state-of-the-art methods like HardTests, which achieve less than
81%. Furthermore, starting with a random seed problem, AutoCode can create
novel variants with reference and brute-force solutions. By cross-verifying
these generated solutions against test cases, we can further filter out
malformed problems. Our system ensures high correctness, as verified by human
experts. AutoCode successfully produces novel problems judged by
Grandmaster-level (top 0.3%) competitive programmers to be of contest quality.

Authors: Junyao Huang, Rumin Situ
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI eess.AS
Comments: 24 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables. First continuous VA framework for pet

\\
  Traditional pet emotion recognition from vocalizations, based on discrete
classification, struggles with ambiguity and capturing intensity variations. We
propose a continuous Valence-Arousal (VA) model that represents emotions in a
two-dimensional space. Our method uses an automatic VA label generation
algorithm, enabling large-scale annotation of 42,553 pet vocalization samples.
A multi-task learning framework jointly trains VA regression with auxiliary
tasks (emotion, body size, gender) to enhance prediction by improving feature
learning. Our Audio Transformer model achieves a validation Valence Pearson
correlation of r = 0.9024 and an Arousal r = 0.7155, effectively resolving
confusion between discrete categories like "territorial" and "happy." This work
introduces the first continuous VA framework for pet vocalization analysis,
offering a more expressive representation for human-pet interaction, veterinary
diagnostics, and behavioral training. The approach shows strong potential for
deployment in consumer products like AI pet emotion translators.

  The growing philosophical literature on algorithmic fairness has examined
statistical criteria such as equalized odds and calibration, causal and
counterfactual approaches, and the role of structural and compounding
injustices. Yet an important dimension has been overlooked: whether the
evidential value of an algorithmic output itself depends on structural
injustice. Our paradigmatic pair of examples contrasts a predictive policing
algorithm, which relies on historical crime data, with a camera-based system
that records ongoing offenses, both designed to guide police deployment. In
evaluating the moral acceptability of acting on a piece of evidence, we must
ask not only whether the evidence is probative in the actual world, but also
whether it would remain probative in nearby worlds without the relevant
injustices. The predictive policing algorithm fails this test, but the
camera-based system passes it. When evidence fails the test, it is morally
problematic to use it punitively, more so than evidence that passes the test.

  and Evaluation

  Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has undergone a profound transformation
over the past decade, driven by advances in deep learning. This survey provides
a comprehensive overview of the modern era of ASR, charting its evolution from
traditional hybrid systems, such as Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden Markov Models
(GMM-HMMs) and Deep Neural Network-HMMs (DNN-HMMs), to the now-dominant
end-to-end neural architectures. We systematically review the foundational
end-to-end paradigms: Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC),
attention-based encoder-decoder models, and the Recurrent Neural Network
Transducer (RNN-T), which established the groundwork for fully integrated
speech-to-text systems. We then detail the subsequent architectural shift
towards Transformer and Conformer models, which leverage self-attention to
capture long-range dependencies with high computational efficiency. A central
theme of this survey is the parallel revolution in training paradigms. We
examine the progression from fully supervised learning, augmented by techniques
like SpecAugment, to the rise of self-supervised learning (SSL) with foundation
models such as wav2vec 2.0, which drastically reduce the reliance on
transcribed data. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of largescale, weakly
supervised models like Whisper, which achieve unprecedented robustness through
massive data diversity. The paper also covers essential ecosystem components,
including key datasets and benchmarks (e.g., LibriSpeech, Switchboard, CHiME),
standard evaluation metrics (e.g., Word Error Rate), and critical
considerations for real-world deployment, such as streaming inference,
on-device efficiency, and the ethical imperatives of fairness and robustness.
We conclude by outlining open challenges and future research directions.

Title: Coherent Load Profile Synthesis with Conditional Diffusion for LV
  Distribution Network Scenario Generation

Categories: eess.SY cs.AI cs.LG cs.SY eess.SP
\\
  Limited visibility of power distribution network power flows at the low
voltage level presents challenges to both distribution network operators from a
planning perspective and distribution system operators from a congestion
management perspective. Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis
is confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across
representative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on
summarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the
complexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in
specific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative
models, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative
loads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can
approximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour
between substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network
operation, is often overlooked. This limitation will become even more
pronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as
estimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, a
Conditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power
profiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed. The
evaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing
temporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling. The results
show synthesised load profiles are plausible both independently and as a cohort
in a wider power systems context. The Conditional Diffusion model is
benchmarked against both naive and state-of-the-art models to demonstrate its
effectiveness in producing realistic scenarios on which to base sub-regional
power distribution network planning and operations.

  Human communication is multimodal, with speech and gestures tightly coupled,
yet most computational methods for generating speech and gestures synthesize
them sequentially, weakening synchrony and prosody alignment. We introduce
Gelina, a unified framework that jointly synthesizes speech and co-speech
gestures from text using interleaved token sequences in a discrete
autoregressive backbone, with modality-specific decoders. Gelina supports
multi-speaker and multi-style cloning and enables gesture-only synthesis from
speech inputs. Subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate competitive
speech quality and improved gesture generation over unimodal baselines.

  Content Classification

Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  Developing AI systems capable of nuanced ethical reasoning is critical as
they increasingly influence human decisions, yet existing models often rely on
superficial correlations rather than principled moral understanding. This paper
introduces Ethic-BERT, a BERT-based model for ethical content classification
across four domains: Commonsense, Justice, Virtue, and Deontology. Leveraging
the ETHICS dataset, our approach integrates robust preprocessing to address
vocabulary sparsity and contextual ambiguities, alongside advanced fine-tuning
strategies like full model unfreezing, gradient accumulation, and adaptive
learning rate scheduling. To evaluate robustness, we employ an adversarially
filtered "Hard Test" split, isolating complex ethical dilemmas. Experimental
results demonstrate Ethic-BERT's superiority over baseline models, achieving
82.32% average accuracy on the standard test, with notable improvements in
Justice and Virtue. In addition, the proposed Ethic-BERT attains 15.28% average
accuracy improvement in the HardTest. These findings contribute to performance
improvement and reliable decision-making using bias-aware preprocessing and
proposed enhanced AI model.

Title: Adaptive Generation of Bias-Eliciting Questions for LLMs
Authors: Robin Staab, Jasper Dekoninck, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are now widely deployed in user-facing
applications, reaching hundreds of millions worldwide. As they become
integrated into everyday tasks, growing reliance on their outputs raises
significant concerns. In particular, users may unknowingly be exposed to
model-inherent biases that systematically disadvantage or stereotype certain
groups. However, existing bias benchmarks continue to rely on templated prompts
or restrictive multiple-choice questions that are suggestive, simplistic, and
fail to capture the complexity of real-world user interactions. In this work,
we address this gap by introducing a counterfactual bias evaluation framework
that automatically generates realistic, open-ended questions over sensitive
attributes such as sex, race, or religion. By iteratively mutating and
selecting bias-inducing questions, our approach systematically explores areas
where models are most susceptible to biased behavior. Beyond detecting harmful
biases, we also capture distinct response dimensions that are increasingly
relevant in user interactions, such as asymmetric refusals and explicit
acknowledgment of bias. Leveraging our framework, we construct CAB, a
human-verified benchmark spanning diverse topics, designed to enable
cross-model comparisons. Using CAB, we analyze a range of LLMs across multiple
bias dimensions, revealing nuanced insights into how different models manifest
bias. For instance, while GPT-5 outperforms other models, it nonetheless
exhibits persistent biases in specific scenarios. These findings underscore the
need for continual improvements to ensure fair model behavior.

Title: Three Lenses on the AI Revolution: Risk, Transformation, Continuity
Authors: Masoud Makrehchi
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
Comments: 17 pages
\\
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as both a continuation of historical
technological revolutions and a potential rupture with them. This paper argues
that AI must be viewed simultaneously through three lenses: \textit{risk},
where it resembles nuclear technology in its irreversible and global
externalities; \textit{transformation}, where it parallels the Industrial
Revolution as a general-purpose technology driving productivity and
reorganization of labor; and \textit{continuity}, where it extends the
fifty-year arc of computing revolutions from personal computing to the internet
to mobile. Drawing on historical analogies, we emphasize that no past
transition constituted a strict singularity: disruptive shifts eventually
became governable through new norms and institutions.
  We examine recurring patterns across revolutions -- democratization at the
usage layer, concentration at the production layer, falling costs, and
deepening personalization -- and show how these dynamics are intensifying in
the AI era. Sectoral analysis illustrates how accounting, law, education,
translation, advertising, and software engineering are being reshaped as
routine cognition is commoditized and human value shifts to judgment, trust,
and ethical responsibility. At the frontier, the challenge of designing moral
AI agents highlights the need for robust guardrails, mechanisms for moral
generalization, and governance of emergent multi-agent dynamics.
  We conclude that AI is neither a singular break nor merely incremental
progress. It is both evolutionary and revolutionary: predictable in its median
effects yet carrying singularity-class tail risks. Good outcomes are not
automatic; they require coupling pro-innovation strategies with safety
governance, ensuring equitable access, and embedding AI within a human order of
responsibility.

Categories: astro-ph.IM cs.AI
\\
  Analyzing large-scale scientific datasets presents substantial challenges due
to their sheer volume, structural complexity, and the need for specialized
domain knowledge. Automation tools, such as PandasAI, typically require full
data ingestion and lack context of the full data structure, making them
impractical as intelligent data analysis assistants for datasets at the
terabyte scale. To overcome these limitations, we propose InferA, a multi-agent
system that leverages large language models to enable scalable and efficient
scientific data analysis. At the core of the architecture is a supervisor agent
that orchestrates a team of specialized agents responsible for distinct phases
of the data retrieval and analysis. The system engages interactively with users
to elicit their analytical intent and confirm query objectives, ensuring
alignment between user goals and system actions. To demonstrate the framework's
usability, we evaluate the system using ensemble runs from the HACC cosmology
simulation which comprises several terabytes.

  Personalized Voice Activity Detection (PVAD) systems activate only in
response to a specific target speaker by incorporating speaker embeddings from
enrollment utterances. Unlike existing methods that require architectural
changes, such as FiLM layers, our approach employs a hypernetwork to modify the
weights of a few selected layers within a standard voice activity detection
(VAD) model. This enables speaker conditioning without changing the VAD
architecture, allowing the same VAD model to adapt to different speakers by
updating only a small subset of the layers. We propose HyWA-PVAD, a
hypernetwork weight adaptation method, and evaluate it against multiple
baseline conditioning techniques. Our comparison shows consistent improvements
in PVAD performance. HyWA also offers practical advantages for deployment by
preserving the core VAD architecture. Our new approach improves the current
conditioning techniques in two ways: i) increases the mean average precision,
ii) simplifies deployment by reusing the same VAD architecture.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks aim to enhance Code Language
Models (CLMs) by including another module for retrieving relevant context to
construct the input prompt. However, these retrieval modules commonly use
semantic search, requiring substantial computational resources for training and
hosting these embedded models, making them infeasible to integrate into
lightweight applications such as in-IDE AI-based code completion. In this
solution paper, we prove that using keyword-search is sufficient to retrieve
relevant and useful code context inside large codebases, without the need for
extensive GPU resources. The usefulness of code contexts found by our solution
is demonstrated through their completion results on the Code Context
Competition's benchmark, reaching 0.748 and 0.725 chRF scores on Kotlin and
Python tracks, respectively.

Title: A Multimodal XAI Framework for Trustworthy CNNs and Bias Detection in
  Deep Representation Learning
Authors: Noor Islam S. Mohammad
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Standard benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, often fail to expose latent
biases and multimodal feature complexities, limiting the trustworthiness of
deep neural networks in high-stakes applications. We propose a novel multimodal
Explainable AI (XAI) framework that unifies attention-augmented feature fusion,
Grad-CAM++-based local explanations, and a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop for
bias detection and mitigation. Evaluated on multimodal extensions of MNIST, our
approach achieves 93.2% classification accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1%
explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI), outperforming unimodal and non-explainable
baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that integrating interpretability with
bias-aware learning enhances robustness and human alignment. Our work bridges
the gap between performance, transparency, and fairness, highlighting a
practical pathway for trustworthy AI in sensitive domains.

Title: Max It or Miss It: Benchmarking LLM On Solving Extremal Problems

Comments: Our benchmark dataset is available at
  https://huggingface.co/datasets/binxingao/extrem-bench
\\
  Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

Title: Developing and Validating the Arabic Version of the Attitudes Toward
  Large Language Models Scale

\\
  As the use of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly global,
understanding public attitudes toward these systems requires tools that are
adapted to local contexts and languages. In the Arab world, LLM adoption has
grown rapidly with both globally dominant platforms and regional ones like
Fanar and Jais offering Arabic-specific solutions. This highlights the need for
culturally and linguistically relevant scales to accurately measure attitudes
toward LLMs in the region. Tools assessing attitudes toward artificial
intelligence (AI) can provide a base for measuring attitudes specific to LLMs.
The 5-item Attitudes Toward Artificial Intelligence (ATAI) scale, which
measures two dimensions, the AI Fear and the AI Acceptance, has been recently
adopted and adapted to develop new instruments in English using a sample from
the UK: the Attitudes Toward General LLMs (AT-GLLM) and Attitudes Toward
Primary LLM (AT-PLLM) scales. In this paper, we translate the two scales,
AT-GLLM and AT-PLLM, and validate them using a sample of 249 Arabic-speaking
adults. The results show that the scale, translated into Arabic, is a reliable
and valid tool that can be used for the Arab population and language.
Psychometric analyses confirmed a two-factor structure, strong measurement
invariance across genders, and good internal reliability. The scales also
demonstrated strong convergent and discriminant validity. Our scales will
support research in a non-Western context, a much-needed effort to help draw a
global picture of LLM perceptions, and will also facilitate localized research
and policy-making in the Arab region.

  Social and behavioral scientists increasingly aim to study how humans
interact, collaborate, and make decisions alongside artificial intelligence.
However, the experimental infrastructure for such work remains underdeveloped:
(1) few platforms support real-time, multi-party studies at scale; (2) most
deployments require bespoke engineering, limiting replicability and
accessibility, and (3) existing tools do not treat AI agents as first-class
participants. We present Deliberate Lab, an open-source platform for
large-scale, real-time behavioral experiments that supports both human
participants and large language model (LLM)-based agents. We report on a
12-month public deployment of the platform (N=88 experimenters, N=9195
experiment participants), analyzing usage patterns and workflows. Case studies
and usage scenarios are aggregated from platform users, complemented by
in-depth interviews with select experimenters. By lowering technical barriers
and standardizing support for hybrid human-AI experimentation, Deliberate Lab
expands the methodological repertoire for studying collective decision-making

  Based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the paper introduces two
optimizers, named Interpolational Accelerating Gradient Descent (IAGD) as well
as Noise-Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent (NRSGD). IAGD leverages
second-order Newton Interpolation to expedite the convergence process during
training, assuming relevancy in gradients between iterations. To avoid
over-fitting, NRSGD incorporates a noise regularization technique that
introduces controlled noise to the gradients during the optimization process.
Comparative experiments of this research are conducted on the CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets, benchmarking different CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks)
with IAGD and NRSGD against classical optimizers in Keras Package. Results
demonstrate the potential of those two viable improvement methods in SGD,
implicating the effectiveness of the advancements.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.SY eess.SP eess.SY math.OC
Comments: Accepted at IEEE Asilomar, 2025
\\
  Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective
functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important
subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the
problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization
lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a
structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the
streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,
an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data
samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,
which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which
geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive
tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between
the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under
gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE
vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas
discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount
factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our
theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

Title: VLA-0: Building State-of-the-Art VLAs with Zero Modification
Authors: Ankit Goyal, Hugo Hadfield, Xuning Yang, Valts Blukis, Fabio Ramos
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling
generalist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an
open question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the
existing vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or
introducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of
representing actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This
work introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only
effective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0
outperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating
VLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data,
including $\pi_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without
large-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on
large-scale robotic data, like $\pi_0.5$-KI, $\pi_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct.
These findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms
SmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper
summarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques
required to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design.

  Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple
temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for
representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict
masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable
representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal
tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve
high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with
high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM)
centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i)
multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural
spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for
high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware
loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG
compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency
bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results
demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms
existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ
tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose
brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and
multimodal biosignal integration.

Title: Transformer-based Scalable Beamforming Optimization via Deep Residual
  Learning
Authors: Yubo Zhang, Xiao-Yang Liu, and Xiaodong Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI eess.SP
Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming
in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing
real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic
communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm,
a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer
features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are
introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and
avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer
block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to
stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a
time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing
baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at
high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and
online learning approaches.

Title: A Multi-dimensional Semantic Surprise Framework Based on Low-Entropy
  Semantic Manifolds for Fine-Grained Out-of-Distribution Detection
Authors: Ningkang Peng, Yuzhe Mao, Yuhao Zhang, Linjin Qian, Qianfeng Yu,
  Yanhui Gu, Yi Chen, Li Kong
Categories: stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a cornerstone for the safe deployment
of AI systems in the open world. However, existing methods treat OOD detection
as a binary classification problem, a cognitive flattening that fails to
distinguish between semantically close (Near-OOD) and distant (Far-OOD) unknown
risks. This limitation poses a significant safety bottleneck in applications
requiring fine-grained risk stratification. To address this, we propose a
paradigm shift from a conventional probabilistic view to a principled
information-theoretic framework. We formalize the core task as quantifying the
Semantic Surprise of a new sample and introduce a novel ternary classification
challenge: In-Distribution (ID) vs. Near-OOD vs. Far-OOD. The theoretical
foundation of our work is the concept of Low-Entropy Semantic Manifolds, which
are explicitly structured to reflect the data's intrinsic semantic hierarchy.
To construct these manifolds, we design a Hierarchical Prototypical Network. We
then introduce the Semantic Surprise Vector (SSV), a universal probe that
decomposes a sample's total surprise into three complementary and interpretable
dimensions: conformity, novelty, and ambiguity. To evaluate performance on this
new task, we propose the Normalized Semantic Risk (nSR), a cost-sensitive
metric. Experiments demonstrate that our framework not only establishes a new
state-of-the-art (sota) on the challenging ternary task, but its robust
representations also achieve top results on conventional binary benchmarks,
reducing the False Positive Rate by over 60% on datasets like LSUN.

\\
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize Natural Language
Processing (NLP) applications, critical concerns about their trustworthiness
persist, particularly in safety and robustness. To address these challenges, we
introduce TRUSTVIS, an automated evaluation framework that provides a
comprehensive assessment of LLM trustworthiness. A key feature of our framework
is its interactive user interface, designed to offer intuitive visualizations
of trustworthiness metrics. By integrating well-known perturbation methods like
AutoDAN and employing majority voting across various evaluation methods,
TRUSTVIS not only provides reliable results but also makes complex evaluation
processes accessible to users. Preliminary case studies on models like
Vicuna-7b, Llama2-7b, and GPT-3.5 demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in identifying safety and robustness vulnerabilities, while the
interactive interface allows users to explore results in detail, empowering
targeted model improvements. Video Link: https://youtu.be/k1TrBqNVg8g

Title: On the Reasoning Abilities of Masked Diffusion Language Models
Authors: Anej Svete, Ashish Sabharwal
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to
traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them
efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to
their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what
types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do
this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of
thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision
log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact,
equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that
CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems
(including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than
CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster
reasoning.

Comments: This work has been accepted for publication in the Main Conference of
  the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2025
\\
  Despite continuous advancements in the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), numerical reasoning remains a challenging area. Techniques like
chain-of-thought prompting, tree-of-thought prompting, and program-of-thought
prompting guide LLMs through intermediate reasoning steps. Although in-context
learning with few-shot prompting has improved performance, LLMs still lag
behind state-of-the-art models on financial numerical reasoning datasets such
as FinQA and ConvFinQA. In this work, we introduce FINDER, a novel two-step
framework, to enhance LLMs' capabilities in financial numerical reasoning. The
first step utilizes a generative retriever to extract relevant facts from
unstructured data, including both text and tables. This is followed by
context-aware Program of Thought prompting with dynamic selection of in-context
examples. Our model FINDER achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on both
the FinQA and ConvFinQA datasets, surpassing previous benchmarks with execution
accuracy improvements of 5.98% and 4.05%, respectively.

Title: Behavioral Embeddings of Programs: A Quasi-Dynamic Approach for
  Optimization Prediction
Authors: Haolin Pan, Jinyuan Dong, Hongbin Zhang, Hongyu Lin, Mingjie Xing,
  Yanjun Wu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a
fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance
compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static
representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),
are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program
will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic
representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights
into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks
due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends
this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program
representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization
sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation
generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization
sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To
effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a
compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize
the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.
Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to
learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive
experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass
Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/PREP/.

  Detection
Authors: Amirhossein Mozafari, Kourosh Hashemi, Erfan Shafagh, Soroush
  Motamedi, Azar Taheri Tayebi and Mohammad A. Tayebi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited
availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high
dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are
challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches
often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we
introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to
detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and
interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a
neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared
embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing
both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that
generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables
data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging
the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the
large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four
state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of
1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the
complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the
framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning
process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency,
offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare
fraud detection.

Authors: Xuanchen Wang, Heng Wang, Weidong Cai

Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure. demo page: https://motionbeat2025.github.io/
\\
  Music is both an auditory and an embodied phenomenon, closely linked to human
motion and naturally expressed through dance. However, most existing audio
representations neglect this embodied dimension, limiting their ability to
capture rhythmic and structural cues that drive movement. We propose
MotionBeat, a framework for motion-aligned music representation learning.
MotionBeat is trained with two newly proposed objectives: the Embodied
Contrastive Loss (ECL), an enhanced InfoNCE formulation with tempo-aware and
beat-jitter negatives to achieve fine-grained rhythmic discrimination, and the
Structural Rhythm Alignment Loss (SRAL), which ensures rhythm consistency by
aligning music accents with corresponding motion events. Architecturally,
MotionBeat introduces bar-equivariant phase rotations to capture cyclic
rhythmic patterns and contact-guided attention to emphasize motion events
synchronized with musical accents. Experiments show that MotionBeat outperforms
state-of-the-art audio encoders in music-to-dance generation and transfers
effectively to beat tracking, music tagging, genre and instrument
classification, emotion recognition, and audio-visual retrieval. Our project

Title: A Ratio-Based Shapley Value for Collaborative Machine Learning -
  Extended Version

Comments: Extended version of a paper accepted at the 26th International
  Conference on Principles and Practice of Multi-Agent Systems (PRIMA 2025)
\\
  Collaborative machine learning enables multiple data owners to jointly train
models for improved predictive performance. However, ensuring incentive
compatibility and fair contribution-based rewards remains a critical challenge.
Prior work by Sim and colleagues (Rachel Hwee Ling Sim et al: Collaborative
machine learning with incentive-aware model rewards. In: International
conference on machine learning. PMLR. 2020, pp. 8927-8963) addressed this by
allocating model rewards, which are non-monetary and freely replicable, based
on the Shapley value of each party's data contribution, measured via
information gain. In this paper, we introduce a ratio-based Shapley value that
replaces the standard additive formulation with a relative contribution
measure. While our overall reward framework, including the incentive
definitions and model-reward setting, remains aligned with that of Sim and
colleagues, the underlying value function is fundamentally different. Our
alternative valuation induces a different distribution of model rewards and
offers a new lens through which to analyze incentive properties. We formally
define the ratio-based value and prove that it satisfies the same set of
incentive conditions as the additive formulation, including adapted versions of
fairness, individual rationality, and stability. Like the original approach,
our method faces the same fundamental trade-offs between these incentives. Our
contribution is a mathematically grounded alternative to the additive Shapley
framework, potentially better suited to contexts where proportionality among
contributors is more meaningful than additive differences.

  We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled
framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through
selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed,
manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering,
MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction,
and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving
performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments
across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,
non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.
Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further
enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient
approach to mechanistic activation steering.

Title: Injection, Attack and Erasure: Revocable Backdoor Attacks via Machine
  Unlearning
Authors: Baogang Song, Dongdong Zhao, Jianwen Xiang, Qiben Xu and Zizhuo Yu
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Backdoor attacks pose a persistent security risk to deep neural networks
(DNNs) due to their stealth and durability. While recent research has explored
leveraging model unlearning mechanisms to enhance backdoor concealment,
existing attack strategies still leave persistent traces that may be detected
through static analysis. In this work, we introduce the first paradigm of
revocable backdoor attacks, where the backdoor can be proactively and
thoroughly removed after the attack objective is achieved. We formulate the
trigger optimization in revocable backdoor attacks as a bilevel optimization
problem: by simulating both backdoor injection and unlearning processes, the
trigger generator is optimized to achieve a high attack success rate (ASR)
while ensuring that the backdoor can be easily erased through unlearning. To
mitigate the optimization conflict between injection and removal objectives, we
employ a deterministic partition of poisoning and unlearning samples to reduce
sampling-induced variance, and further apply the Projected Conflicting Gradient
(PCGrad) technique to resolve the remaining gradient conflicts. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate that our method maintains ASR comparable to
state-of-the-art backdoor attacks, while enabling effective removal of backdoor
behavior after unlearning. This work opens a new direction for backdoor attack
research and presents new challenges for the security of machine learning
systems.

Title: Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning of LLMs
Authors: Nicolas Menet, Aleksandar Terzi\'c, Andreas Krause, Abbas Rahimi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered
by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the
absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson
sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by
directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum
reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the
prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and
incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a
novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that
matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals
the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of
maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we
validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally
stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online
fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on
computational efficiency.

Title: Adversarial Fine-tuning in Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning for
  Robust Robot Control
Authors: Shingo Ayabe, Hiroshi Kera, Kazuhiko Kawamoto
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
Comments: 16 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Offline reinforcement learning enables sample-efficient policy acquisition
without risky online interaction, yet policies trained on static datasets
remain brittle under action-space perturbations such as actuator faults. This
study introduces an offline-to-online framework that trains policies on clean
data and then performs adversarial fine-tuning, where perturbations are
injected into executed actions to induce compensatory behavior and improve
resilience. A performance-aware curriculum further adjusts the perturbation
probability during training via an exponential-moving-average signal, balancing
robustness and stability throughout the learning process. Experiments on
continuous-control locomotion tasks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently improves robustness over offline-only baselines and converges
faster than training from scratch. Matching the fine-tuning and evaluation
conditions yields the strongest robustness to action-space perturbations, while
the adaptive curriculum strategy mitigates the degradation of nominal
performance observed with the linear curriculum strategy. Overall, the results
show that adversarial fine-tuning enables adaptive and robust control under
uncertain environments, bridging the gap between offline efficiency and online
adaptability.

Title: Generalist++: A Meta-learning Framework for Mitigating Trade-off in
  Adversarial Training
Authors: Yisen Wang, Yichuan Mo, Hongjun Wang, Junyi Li, Zhouchen Lin
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR
\\
  Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable
to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the
most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical
applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade
significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer
well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior
works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we
propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,
each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated
objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the
later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a
knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global
parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories
from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist
and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist
achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off
problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist
provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the
future.

  Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based
reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online
model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design
decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share
components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that
transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online
model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs,
share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for
training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies
enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks,
and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical

Title: MADREC: A Multi-Aspect Driven LLM Agent for Explainable and Adaptive
  Recommendation
Authors: Jiin Park and Misuk Kim
Categories: cs.IR cs.AI
Comments: 18 pages
\\
  Recent attempts to integrate large language models (LLMs) into recommender
systems have gained momentum, but most remain limited to simple text generation
or static prompt-based inference, failing to capture the complexity of user
preferences and real-world interactions. This study proposes the Multi-Aspect
Driven LLM Agent MADRec, an autonomous LLM-based recommender that constructs
user and item profiles by unsupervised extraction of multi-aspect information
from reviews and performs direct recommendation, sequential recommendation, and
explanation generation. MADRec generates structured profiles via
aspect-category-based summarization and applies Re-Ranking to construct
high-density inputs. When the ground-truth item is missing from the output, the
Self-Feedback mechanism dynamically adjusts the inference criteria. Experiments
across multiple domains show that MADRec outperforms traditional and LLM-based
baselines in both precision and explainability, with human evaluation further
confirming the persuasiveness of the generated explanations.

Title: From Minimal Existence to Human Definition: The CES-IMU-HSG Theoretical
  Framework
Authors: Kei Itoh
Categories: cs.NE cs.AI cs.LO
Comments: 57 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, in English, in Japanese
\\
  This study presents an inter-universal mathematical-logical framework
constructed upon the minimal axiom Cogito, ergo sum (CES), integrating the
Intermediate Meta-Universe (IMU) and the Hierarchical State Grid (HSG). The CES
defines existence as a reflexive correspondence --'to be' and 'to be
sayable'--and positions any formal system, including ZFC or HoTT, as an
attachable extension atop this minimal structure. The IMU functions as a
registry of axiomatic dependencies that connect heterogeneous theories,
employing the Institution-theoretic framework to ensure coherent
inter-theoretical linkages. The HSG concretizes these ideas through categorical
construction, defined by three orthogonal axes: the state-depth axis, the
mapping-hierarchy axis, and the temporal axis incorporating the principle of
'no future reference.' Through these, the identity of 'definition = state' is
formally established as a categorical property. Extending this structure to
biological systems, the neural system is implemented as a 0-3D complex of
neuron-function fields on the HSG, while its categorical extensions via
fiberization over the material base enable the parallel integration of multiple
physiological universes-neural, endocrine, learning, genetic, and input/output
systems-into a coherent adjoint ensemble. Within this framework, human behavior
and cognition emerge as temporal compositions of inter-universal algorithms
constrained by the material base. Finally, by contrasting human cognition,
which relies on external CES, with machine existence, this study introduces the
concept of internal CES, wherein a machine grounds its own logic upon the
factuality of its operation. This internal self-axiomatization establishes a
continuous bridge between philosophical ontology and engineering
implementation, providing a new foundation for the autonomous and self-defining
existence of artificial intelligence.

Title: Rectify and Align GPS Points to Parking Spots via Rank-1 Constraint
Authors: Jiaxing Deng, Junbiao Pang, Zhicheng Wang, Haitao Yu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for
residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking
spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,
parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to
cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides,
the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error.
Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a
large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper,
motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are
parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to
effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking
spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and
alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors.

Title: Neural Sum-of-Squares: Certifying the Nonnegativity of Polynomials with
  Transformers
Authors: Nico Pelleriti, Christoph Spiegel, Shiwei Liu, David Mart\'inez-Rubio,
  Max Zimmer, Sebastian Pokutta
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with
direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and
beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)
property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In
practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally
expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose
dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS
expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis
have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented
algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer
model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,
thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall
methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset
generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the
corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to
ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our
approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$
compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances
where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards
transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

Title: DistilCLIP-EEG: Enhancing Epileptic Seizure Detection Through
  Multi-modal Learning and Knowledge Distillation

  Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief
episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical
discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep
learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,
neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,
we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP
framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture
comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder
based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable
BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared
latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance
efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where
the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student
model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT
datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding
97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94,
demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework.
Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately
58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity
and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results
highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection
and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in
resource-constrained settings.

Title: Offline and Online KL-Regularized RLHF under Differential Privacy
Authors: Yulian Wu, Rushil Thareja, Praneeth Vepakomma, and Francesco Orabona
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used
objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$
local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human
preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the
principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under
single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a
matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the
problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm
and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log
(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time
step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF.
As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for
online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the
offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source
code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.

  Basis

Categories: physics.plasm-ph cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures, 1 table
\\
  Numerical computation of the ideal Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium
magnetic field is at the base of stellarator optimisation and provides the
starting point for solving more sophisticated Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs) like transport or turbulence models. Conventional approaches solve for a
single stationary point of the ideal MHD equations, which is fully defined by
three invariants and the numerical scheme employed by the solver. We present
the first numerical approach that can solve for a continuous distribution of
equilibria with fixed boundary and rotational transform, varying only the
pressure invariant. This approach minimises the force residual by optimising
parameters of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) that map from a scalar pressure
multiplier to the Fourier Zernike basis as implemented in the modern
stellarator equilibrium solver DESC.

\\
  On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight
resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile
devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple
LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered
incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem
types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online
continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while
preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we
propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and
merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store
only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world
tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative
strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of
on-device settings.

Authors: Avihay Cohen
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
Comments: 37 pages , 10 figures
\\
  Large Language Model (LLM) based agents integrated into web browsers (often
called agentic AI browsers) offer powerful automation of web tasks. However,
they are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious
instructions hidden in a webpage deceive the agent into unwanted actions. These
attacks can bypass traditional web security boundaries, as the AI agent
operates with the user privileges across sites. In this paper, we present a
novel fuzzing framework that runs entirely in the browser and is guided by an
LLM to automatically discover such prompt injection vulnerabilities in real

  The escalating complexity of modern software imposes an unsustainable
operational burden on Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams, demanding
AI-driven automation that can emulate expert diagnostic reasoning. Existing
solutions, from traditional AI methods to general-purpose multi-agent systems,
fall short: they either lack deep causal reasoning or are not tailored for the
specialized, investigative workflows unique to SRE. To address this gap, we
present OpenDerisk, a specialized, open-source multi-agent framework
architected for SRE. OpenDerisk integrates a diagnostic-native collaboration
model, a pluggable reasoning engine, a knowledge engine, and a standardized
protocol (MCP) to enable specialist agents to collectively solve complex,
multi-domain problems. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that
OpenDerisk significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
accuracy and efficiency. This effectiveness is validated by its large-scale
production deployment at Ant Group, where it serves over 3,000 daily users
across diverse scenarios, confirming its industrial-grade scalability and
practical impact. OpenDerisk is open source and available at

Title: Subject Roles in the EU AI Act: Mapping and Regulatory Implications
Authors: Nicola Fabiano
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)
establishes the world's first comprehensive regulatory framework for AI systems
through a sophisticated ecosystem of interconnected subjects defined in Article
3. This paper provides a structured examination of the six main categories of
actors - providers, deployers, authorized representatives, importers,
distributors, and product manufacturers - collectively referred to as
"operators" within the regulation. Through examination of these Article 3
definitions and their elaboration across the regulation's 113 articles, 180
recitals, and 13 annexes, we map the complete governance structure and analyze
how the AI Act regulates these subjects. Our analysis reveals critical
transformation mechanisms whereby subjects can assume different roles under
specific conditions, particularly through Article 25 provisions ensuring
accountability follows control. We identify how obligations cascade through the
supply chain via mandatory information flows and cooperation requirements,
creating a distributed yet coordinated governance system. The findings
demonstrate how the regulation balances innovation with the protection of
fundamental rights through risk-based obligations that scale with the
capabilities and deployment contexts of AI systems, providing essential
guidance for stakeholders implementing the AI Act's requirements.

  We propose EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding
GNN architecture, EB-GNN. Our architecture is inspired by a classic triangle
counting algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki, and explicitly uses triangles during
message passing. We achieve the following results: (1)~EB-1WL is significantly
more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical
characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching
distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important
distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures,
EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph
learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient
general-purpose architecture: It substantially outperforms simple MPNNs, and
remains competitive with task-specialized GNNs while being significantly more
computationally efficient.

  Cutting-edge research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires considerable
resources, including Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), data, and human
resources. In this paper, we evaluate of the relationship between these
resources and the scientific advancement of foundation models (FM). We reviewed
6517 FM papers published between 2022 to 2024, and surveyed 229 first-authors
to the impact of computing resources on scientific output. We find that
increased computing is correlated with national funding allocations and
citations, but our findings don't observe the strong correlations with research
environment (academic or industrial), domain, or study methodology. We advise
that individuals and institutions focus on creating shared and affordable
computing opportunities to lower the entry barrier for under-resourced
researchers. These steps can help expand participation in FM research, foster
diversity of ideas and contributors, and sustain innovation and progress in AI.

Title: Time Series Foundation Models: Benchmarking Challenges and Requirements
Authors: Marcel Meyer, Sascha Kaltenpoth, Kevin Zalipski, Oliver M\"uller
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time
series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the
need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large
Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive
training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of
benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights
multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark
datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information
leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global
patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our
findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking
inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to
local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation
methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time
series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new,
principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data,
to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Journal-ref: NeurIPS 2025
\\
  The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced
general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot
inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics
data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a
unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems.
Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate
encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To
address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the
Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as
Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor
dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE
foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance
across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple
PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform
competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to
unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining
for foundation models.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO
\\
  Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of
actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization;
unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment
interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that
well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample
efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of
simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain
embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in
sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen
policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial
embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across
a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in
runtime speed.

\\
  Remote inference allows lightweight devices to leverage powerful cloud
models. However, communication network latency makes predictions stale and
unsuitable for real-time tasks. To address this, we introduce Dedelayed, a
delay-corrective method that mitigates arbitrary remote inference delays,
allowing the local device to produce low-latency outputs in real time. Our
method employs a lightweight local model that processes the current frame and
fuses in features that a heavyweight remote model computes from past frames. On
video from the BDD100K driving dataset, Dedelayed improves semantic
segmentation accuracy over the stronger of the local-only and remote-only
baselines across all realistic communication network delays beyond 33 ms.
Without incurring additional delay, it improves accuracy by 6.4 mIoU compared
to fully local inference and 9.8 mIoU compared to remote inference, for a
round-trip delay of 100 ms. The advantage grows under longer delays and
higher-motion scenes, as delay-mitigated split inference sustains accuracy more
effectively, providing clear advantages for real-time tasks that must remain
aligned with the current world state.

  We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and
robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable,
general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided
vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical
link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage
pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning
data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,
embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training
to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through
plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields
consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance
by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO
Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,
point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a
simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,
enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In
real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with
synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel
configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it
surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided
training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language
models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable
to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,
there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic
improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale
systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a
principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit
sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of
common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and
compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic
performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,
and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without
materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow
predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale
runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation
performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work
provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a
practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long
achieved in pre-training.

Title: Provably Invincible Adversarial Attacks on Reinforcement Learning
  Systems: A Rate-Distortion Information-Theoretic Approach
Authors: Ziqing Lu, Lifeng Lai, Weiyu Xu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged
in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial
decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the
robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various
adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work
considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the
recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In
this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of
adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion
information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the
transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very
limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during
the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient
agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this
notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial
attack, such as state observation attacks.

  Critical thinking represents a fundamental competency in today's education
landscape. Developing critical thinking skills through timely assessment and
feedback is crucial; however, there has not been extensive work in the learning
analytics community on defining, measuring, and supporting critical thinking.
In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of measuring core "subskills"
that underlie critical thinking. We ground our work in an authentic task where
students operationalize critical thinking: student-written argumentative
essays. We developed a coding rubric based on an established skills progression
and completed human coding for a corpus of student essays. We then evaluated
three distinct approaches to automated scoring: zero-shot prompting, few-shot
prompting, and supervised fine-tuning, implemented across three large language
models (GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and ModernBERT). GPT-5 with few-shot prompting
achieved the strongest results and demonstrated particular strength on
subskills with separable, frequent categories, while lower performance was
observed for subskills that required detection of subtle distinctions or rare
categories. Our results underscore critical trade-offs in automated critical
thinking assessment: proprietary models offer superior reliability at higher
cost, while open-source alternatives provide practical accuracy with reduced
sensitivity to minority categories. Our work represents an initial step toward
scalable assessment of higher-order reasoning skills across authentic
educational contexts.

  Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and
interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth
raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties
inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor
safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural
Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based
planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural
language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in
decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego
CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information
exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively
express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that
maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate
only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the
scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse
driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31%
increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and
a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

Title: Addressing the alignment problem in transportation policy making: an LLM
  approach
Authors: Xiaoyu Yan, Tianxing Dai, Yu (Marco) Nie
Categories: cs.CY cs.CE cs.CL cs.MA
\\
  A key challenge in transportation planning is that the collective preferences
of heterogeneous travelers often diverge from the policies produced by
model-driven decision tools. This misalignment frequently results in
implementation delays or failures. Here, we investigate whether large language
models (LLMs), noted for their capabilities in reasoning and simulating human
decision-making, can help inform and address this alignment problem. We develop
a multi-agent simulation in which LLMs, acting as agents representing residents
from different communities in a city, participate in a referendum on a set of
transit policy proposals. Using chain-of-thought reasoning, LLM agents provide
ranked-choice or approval-based preferences, which are aggregated using
instant-runoff voting (IRV) to model democratic consensus. We implement this
simulation framework with both GPT-4o and Claude-3.5, and apply it for Chicago
and Houston. Our findings suggest that LLM agents are capable of approximating
plausible collective preferences and responding to local context, while also
displaying model-specific behavioral biases and modest divergences from
optimization-based benchmarks. These capabilities underscore both the promise
and limitations of LLMs as tools for solving the alignment problem in
transportation decision-making.

Title: Two Heads Are Better Than One: Audio-Visual Speech Error Correction with
  Dual Hypotheses
Authors: Sungnyun Kim, Kangwook Jang, Sungwoo Cho, Joon Son Chung, Hoirin Kim,
  Se-Young Yun
Categories: eess.AS cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: Preprint work
\\
  This paper introduces a new paradigm for generative error correction (GER)
framework in audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) that reasons over
modality-specific evidences directly in the language space. Our framework,
DualHyp, empowers a large language model (LLM) to compose independent N-best
hypotheses from separate automatic speech recognition (ASR) and visual speech
recognition (VSR) models. To maximize the effectiveness of DualHyp, we further
introduce RelPrompt, a noise-aware guidance mechanism that provides
modality-grounded prompts to the LLM. RelPrompt offers the temporal reliability
of each modality stream, guiding the model to dynamically switch its focus
between ASR and VSR hypotheses for an accurate correction. Under various
corruption scenarios, our framework attains up to 57.7% error rate gain on the
LRS2 benchmark over standard ASR baseline, contrary to single-stream GER
approaches that achieve only 10% gain. To facilitate research within our
DualHyp framework, we release the code and the dataset comprising ASR and VSR
hypotheses at https://github.com/sungnyun/dualhyp.

  Recent advances in unified multimodal models indicate a clear trend towards
comprehensive content generation. However, the auditory domain remains a
significant challenge, with music and speech often developed in isolation,
hindering progress towards universal audio synthesis. This separation stems
from inherent task conflicts and severe data imbalances, which impede the
development of a truly unified audio generation model. To address this
challenge, we propose UniMoE-Audio, a unified speech and music generation model
within a novel Dynamic-Capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework.
Architecturally, UniMoE-Audio introduces a Top-P routing strategy for dynamic
expert number allocation, and a hybrid expert design comprising routed experts
for domain-specific knowledge, shared experts for domain-agnostic features, and
null experts for adaptive computation skipping. To tackle data imbalance, we
introduce a three-stage training curriculum: 1) Independent Specialist Training
leverages original datasets to instill domain-specific knowledge into each
"proto-expert" without interference; 2) MoE Integration and Warmup incorporates
these specialists into the UniMoE-Audio architecture, warming up the gate
module and shared expert using a subset of balanced dataset; and 3) Synergistic
Joint Training trains the entire model end-to-end on the fully balanced
dataset, fostering enhanced cross-domain synergy. Extensive experiments show
that UniMoE-Audio not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on major
speech and music generation benchmarks, but also demonstrates superior
synergistic learning, mitigating the performance degradation typically seen in
naive joint training. Our findings highlight the substantial potential of
specialized MoE architecture and curated training strategies in advancing the
field of universal audio generation. Homepage:

  Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on
robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental
weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by
introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout,
camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light
conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed
multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath
apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit
extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and
robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under
modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language
variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore
language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that
high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for
evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

  Robotic manipulation policies often struggle to generalize to novel objects,
limiting their real-world utility. In contrast, cognitive science suggests that
children develop generalizable dexterous manipulation skills by mastering a
small set of simple toys and then applying that knowledge to more complex
items. Inspired by this, we study if similar generalization capabilities can
also be achieved by robots. Our results indicate robots can learn generalizable
grasping using randomly assembled objects that are composed from just four
shape primitives: spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. We show that training
on these "toys" enables robust generalization to real-world objects, yielding
strong zero-shot performance. Crucially, we find the key to this generalization
is an object-centric visual representation induced by our proposed detection
pooling mechanism. Evaluated in both simulation and on physical robots, our
model achieves a 67% real-world grasping success rate on the YCB dataset,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that rely on substantially more
in-domain data. We further study how zero-shot generalization performance
scales by varying the number and diversity of training toys and the
demonstrations per toy. We believe this work offers a promising path to
scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation. Demonstration
videos, code, checkpoints and our dataset are available on our project page:

Title: Improving Visual Recommendation on E-commerce Platforms Using
  Vision-Language Models

\\
  On large-scale e-commerce platforms with tens of millions of active monthly
users, recommending visually similar products is essential for enabling users
to efficiently discover items that align with their preferences. This study
presents the application of a vision-language model (VLM) -- which has
demonstrated strong performance in image recognition and image-text retrieval
tasks -- to product recommendations on Mercari, a major consumer-to-consumer
marketplace used by more than 20 million monthly users in Japan. Specifically,
we fine-tuned SigLIP, a VLM employing a sigmoid-based contrastive loss, using
one million product image-title pairs from Mercari collected over a three-month
period, and developed an image encoder for generating item embeddings used in
the recommendation system. Our evaluation comprised an offline analysis of
historical interaction logs and an online A/B test in a production environment.
In offline analysis, the model achieved a 9.1% improvement in nDCG@5 compared
with the baseline. In the online A/B test, the click-through rate improved by
50% whereas the conversion rate improved by 14% compared with the existing
model. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of VLM-based encoders for
e-commerce product recommendations and provide practical insights into the
development of visual similarity-based recommendation systems.

Title: Steerable Conditional Diffusion for Domain Adaptation in PET Image
  Reconstruction

  Diffusion models have recently enabled state-of-the-art reconstruction of
positron emission tomography (PET) images while requiring only image training
data. However, domain shift remains a key concern for clinical adoption: priors
trained on images from one anatomy, acquisition protocol or pathology may
produce artefacts on out-of-distribution data. We propose integrating steerable
conditional diffusion (SCD) with our previously-introduced likelihood-scheduled
diffusion (PET-LiSch) framework to improve the alignment of the diffusion
model's prior to the target subject. At reconstruction time, for each diffusion
step, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to align the diffusion model prior with
the target domain on the fly. Experiments on realistic synthetic 2D brain
phantoms demonstrate that our approach suppresses hallucinated artefacts under
domain shift, i.e. when our diffusion model is trained on perturbed images and
tested on normal anatomy, our approach suppresses the hallucinated structure,
outperforming both OSEM and diffusion model baselines qualitatively and
quantitatively. These results provide a proof-of-concept that steerable priors
can mitigate domain shift in diffusion-based PET reconstruction and motivate
future evaluation on real data.

Title: An efficient approach with theoretical guarantees to simultaneously
  reconstruct activity and attenuation sinogram for TOF-PET

  In positron emission tomography (PET), it is indispensable to perform
attenuation correction in order to obtain the quantitatively accurate activity
map (tracer distribution) in the body. Generally, this is carried out based on
the estimated attenuation map obtained from computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging. However, except for errors in the attenuation correction
factors obtained, the additional scan not only brings in new radiation doses
and/or increases the scanning time but also leads to severe misalignment
induced by various motions during and between the two sequential scans. To
address these issues, based on maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a new
mathematical model for simultaneously reconstructing the activity and
attenuation sinogram from the time-of-flight (TOF)-PET emission data only.
Particularly, we make full use of the exclusively exponential form for the
attenuation correction factors, and consider the constraint of a total amount
of the activity in some mask region in the proposed model. Furthermore, we
prove its well-posedness, including the existence, uniqueness and stability of
the solution. We propose an alternating update algorithm to solve the model,
and also analyze its convergence. Finally, numerical experiments with various
TOF-PET emission data demonstrate that the proposed method is of numerical
convergence and robust to noise, and outperforms some state-of-the-art methods
in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and has the capability of autonomous
attenuation correction.

Title: UrbanFusion: Stochastic Multimodal Fusion for Contrastive Learning of
  Robust Spatial Representations
Authors: Dominik J. M\"uhlematter, Lin Che, Ye Hong, Martin Raubal, Nina
  Wiedemann
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at

Title: F-BFQ: Flexible Block Floating-Point Quantization Accelerator for LLMs
Authors: Jude Haris, Jos\'e Cano
Categories: cs.AR cs.DC cs.LG
Comments: Accepted to Workshop on New Approaches for Addressing the Computing
  Requirements of LLMs and GNNs (LG-ARC) @ ISCA 2025
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly prominent for daily
tasks, from improving sound-totext translation to generating additional frames
for the latest video games. With the help of LLM inference frameworks, such as
llama.cpp, which support optimizations such as KV-caching and quantization, it
is now easier than ever to deploy LLMs on edge devices. Quantization is
fundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, and llama.cpp
utilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit
width of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational
power required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP
quantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due
to quantization. Therefore, to efficiently accelerate across the layers of
BFP-quantized LLMs, specialized accelerators need to support different BFP
variants without reconfiguration. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible
Block FloatingPoint Quantization (F-BFQ) accelerator, which can dynamically
switch between two BFP quantization variants and perform matrix multiplication
(MatMul) operations. Our initial F-BFQ accelerator design, deployed on the AMD
Kria board, reduces inference time by 1.4x on average over the Arm NEON-based
CPU execution across three BFP quantized LLMs while achieving 5.2 tokens per
second (~3.9 words per second).

Title: Equilibria in routing games with connected autonomous vehicles will not
  be strong, as exclusive clubs may form
Authors: Rafa{\l} Kucharski, Anastasia Psarou, Natello Descormier
Categories: cs.GT cs.MA
\\
  User Equilibrium is the standard representation of the so-called routing game
in which drivers adjust their route choices to arrive at their destinations as
fast as possible. Asking whether this Equilibrium is strong or not was
meaningless for human drivers who did not form coalitions due to technical and
behavioral constraints. This is no longer the case for connected autonomous
vehicles (CAVs), which will be able to communicate and collaborate to jointly
form routing coalitions.
  We demonstrate this for the first time on a carefully designed toy-network
example, where a `club` of three autonomous vehicles jointly decides to deviate
from the user equilibrium and benefit (arrive faster). The formation of such a
club has negative consequences for other users, who are not invited to join it
and now travel longer, and for the system, making it suboptimal and
disequilibrated, which triggers adaptation dynamics.
  This discovery has profound implications for the future of our cities. We
demonstrate that, if not prevented, CAV operators may intentionally
disequilibrate traffic systems from their classic Nash equilibria, benefiting
their own users and imposing costs on others. These findings suggest the
possible emergence of an exclusive CAV elite, from which human-driven vehicles
and non-coalition members may be excluded, potentially leading to
systematically longer travel times for those outside the coalition, which would
be harmful for the equity of public road networks.
