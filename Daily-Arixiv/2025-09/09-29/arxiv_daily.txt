Title: Blueprint-Bench: Comparing spatial intelligence of LLMs, agents and
  image models
Authors: Lukas Petersson, Axel Backlund, Axel Wennst\"om, Hanna Petersson,

Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures, submitted for ICLR 2026
\\
  We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

Title: The Causal Abstraction Network: Theory and Learning
Authors: Gabriele D'Acunto, Paolo Di Lorenzo, Sergio Barbarossa
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG eess.SP
\\
  Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Title: A Formal Comparison Between Chain-of-Thought and Latent Thought
Authors: Kevin Xu and Issei Sato
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

Title: Neo-Grounded Theory: A Methodological Innovation Integrating
  High-Dimensional Vector Clustering and Multi-Agent Collaboration for
  Qualitative Research
Authors: Shuide Wen, Beier Ku, Teng Wang, Mingyang Zou and Yang Yang
Categories: cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 44 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

Title: Memory Management and Contextual Consistency for Long-Running Low-Code
  Agents
Authors: Jiexi Xu
Categories: cs.AI cs.SE
Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures, 1 table
ACM-class: I.2.1; H.3.3; D.2.2
\\
  The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

Title: Fact Grounded Attention: Eliminating Hallucination in Large Language
  Models Through Attention Level Knowledge Integration

  "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

Title: Language Model Planning from an Information Theoretic Perspective
Authors: Muhammed Ustaomeroglu, Baris Askin, Gauri Joshi, Carlee Joe-Wong,
  Guannan Qu
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

Title: RADAR: A Risk-Aware Dynamic Multi-Agent Framework for LLM Safety
  Evaluation via Role-Specialized Collaboration
Authors: Xiuyuan Chen, Jian Zhao, Yuchen Yuan, Tianle Zhang, Huilin Zhou, Zheng

\\
  Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

Title: Toward Causal-Visual Programming: Enhancing Agentic Reasoning in
  Low-Code Environments
Authors: Jiexi Xu, Jiaqi Liu, Ran Tong, Su Liu

  Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

Title: ID-RAG: Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Long-Horizon Persona
  Coherence in Generative Agents

  Systems, at ECAI 2025, 12 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

Title: Dive into the Agent Matrix: A Realistic Evaluation of Self-Replication
  Risk in LLM Agents
Authors: Boxuan Zhang, Yi Yu, Jiaxuan Guo, Jing Shao
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG cs.MA
Comments: 21 pages, 6 figures
\\
  The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

Title: Spontaneous High-Order Generalization in Neural Theory-of-Mind Networks
Authors: Yiming Wang, Rui Wang
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

  Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

\\
  Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

  Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

Title: Saliency Guided Longitudinal Medical Visual Question Answering
Authors: Jialin Wu, Xiaofeng Liu
Categories: cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

Title: Boolean Satisfiability via Imitation Learning
Authors: Zewei Zhang, Huan Liu, Yuanhao Yu, Jun Chen, Xiangyu Xu
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Title: RADAR: Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing for Reasoning LLMs
Authors: Nigel Fernandez, Branislav Kveton, Ryan A. Rossi, Andrew S. Lan,
  Zichao Wang
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

  Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and

  Accurate, fair, and explainable allocation of candidates to roles represents
a fundamental challenge across multiple domains including corporate hiring,
academic admissions, fellowship awards, and volunteer placement systems.
Current state-of-the-art approaches suffer from semantic inflexibility,
persistent demographic bias, opacity in decision-making processes, and poor
scalability under dynamic policy constraints. We present GESA (Graph-Enhanced
Semantic Allocation), a comprehensive framework that addresses these
limitations through the integration of domain-adaptive transformer embeddings,
heterogeneous self-supervised graph neural networks, adversarial debiasing
mechanisms, multi-objective genetic optimization, and explainable AI
components. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale international benchmarks
comprising 20,000 candidate profiles and 3,000 role specifications demonstrates
superior performance with 94.5% top-3 allocation accuracy, 37% improvement in
diversity representation, 0.98 fairness score across demographic cate- gories,
and sub-second end-to-end latency. Additionally, GESA incorporates hybrid
recommendation capabilities and glass-box explainability, making it suitable
for deployment across diverse international contexts in industry, academia, and
non-profit sectors.

Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

Title: Plug-and-Play Emotion Graphs for Compositional Prompting in Zero-Shot
  Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Jiacheng Shi, Hongfei Du, Y. Alicia Hong, Ye Gao
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

Title: TDHook: A Lightweight Framework for Interpretability
Authors: Yoann Poupart
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

Title: Understanding Generative Recommendation with Semantic IDs from a
  Model-scaling View
Authors: Jingzhe Liu, Liam Collins, Jiliang Tang, Tong Zhao, Neil Shah, Clark
  Mingxuan Ju
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

Title: Beyond Static Retrieval: Opportunities and Pitfalls of Iterative
  Retrieval in GraphRAG
Authors: Kai Guo, Xinnan Dai, Shenglai Zeng, Harry Shomer, Haoyu Han, Yu Wang,
  Jiliang Tang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Title: Learning to Interact in World Latent for Team Coordination
Authors: Dongsu Lee, Daehee Lee, Yaru Niu, Honguk Woo, Amy Zhang, Ding Zhao
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

\\
  Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

  Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

Title: IRIS: Intrinsic Reward Image Synthesis
Authors: Yihang Chen, Yuanhao Ban, Yunqi Hong, Cho-Jui Hsieh
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

Title: Skip-It? Theoretical Conditions for Layer Skipping in Vision-Language
  Models
Authors: Max Hartman, Vidhata Jayaraman, Moulik Choraria, Akhil Bhimaraju, Lav

Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
\\
  Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

Title: ATLAS: Constraints-Aware Multi-Agent Collaboration for Real-World Travel
  Planning
Authors: Jihye Choi, Jinsung Yoon, Jiefeng Chen, Somesh Jha and Tomas Pfister
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

Title: Building the EHR Foundation Model via Next Event Prediction
Authors: Zekai Chen, Arda Pekis, Kevin Brown
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL q-bio.OT
\\
  Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

Title: Causal Autoencoder-like Generation of Feedback Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with
  an LLM Agent
Authors: Akash Kumar Panda, Olaoluwa Adigun, Bart Kosko
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.HC cs.IR
Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures
\\
  A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

Title: Hybrid Reward Normalization for Process-supervised Non-verifiable
  Agentic Tasks
Authors: Peiran Xu, Zhuohao Li, Xiaoying Xing, Guannan Zhang, Debiao Li, Kunyu
  Shi
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

\\
  Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

Comments: 23 pages, 13 figures
\\
  Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

Title: SMS: Self-supervised Model Seeding for Verification of Machine
  Unlearning
Authors: Weiqi Wang, Chenhan Zhang, Zhiyi Tian, and Shui Yu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

Title: SOCK: A Benchmark for Measuring Self-Replication in Large Language
  Models
Authors: Justin Chavarria, Rohan Raizada, Justin White, Eyad Alhetairshi
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Title: AutoLabs: Cognitive Multi-Agent Systems with Self-Correction for
  Autonomous Chemical Experimentation
Authors: Gihan Panapitiya, Emily Saldanha, Heather Job, Olivia Hess
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

\\
  Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

Title: Landmark-Guided Knowledge for Vision-and-Language Navigation

Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Accepted for publication by International Conference on Intelligent
  Computing 2025
\\
  Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

  Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples

real-world cases.

  Text-to-SQL Translation
Authors: Hasan Alp Cafero\u{g}lu, Mehmet Serhat \c{C}elik, \"Ozg\"ur Ulusoy
Categories: cs.AI cs.DB
\\
  Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

Title: NePTune: A Neuro-Pythonic Framework for Tunable Compositional Reasoning
  on Vision-Language
Authors: Danial Kamali, Parisa Kordjamshidi
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.SC
\\
  Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

Title: Thinking Sparks!: Emergent Attention Heads in Reasoning Models During
  Post Training
Authors: Yein Park, Minbyul Jeong, Jaewoo Kang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

Title: Galton's Law of Mediocrity: Why Large Language Models Regress to the
  Mean and Fail at Creativity in Advertising
Authors: Matt Keon, Aabid Karim, Bhoomika Lohana, Abdul Karim, Thai Nguyen,
  Tara Hamilton, and Ali Abbas
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

Title: Planner-R1: Reward Shaping Enables Efficient Agentic RL with Smaller
  LLMs
Authors: Siyu Zhu, Yanbin Jiang, Hejian Sang, Shao Tang, Qingquan Song, Biao

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

  Bottlenecks
Authors: Alexander Branch, Omead Pooladzandi, Radin Khosraviani, Sunay Gajanan
  Bhat, Jeffrey Jiang, and Gregory Pottie
Categories: cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

Title: Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search
Authors: Xinzhe Li
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Under Review
\\
  Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

Title: HiStyle: Hierarchical Style Embedding Predictor for Text-Prompt-Guided
  Controllable Speech Synthesis
Authors: Ziyu Zhang, Hanzhao Li, Jingbin Hu, Wenhao Li, Lei Xie
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

Title: ASGuard: Activation-Scaling Guard to Mitigate Targeted Jailbreaking
  Attack
Authors: Yein Park, Jungwoo Park, Jaewoo Kang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

  Architecture Search

Categories: cs.AI cs.AR cs.ET cs.NE
\\
  To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

  Agents

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

\\
  The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

  Healthcare and Medicine are under constant pressure to provide patient-driven

such scenarios, the diagnosis contains, the family history, long term medical

Rescue services need to provide fast, reliable treatments for the patient in

real-time vitals-monitoring, and situation detection through artificial

accurate patient-data-driven medical treatments. In KIRETT, a wearable device

Title: Boosting Process-Correct CoT Reasoning by Modeling Solvability of
  Multiple-Choice QA
Authors: Raphael Schumann, Stefan Riezler
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

Title: NuRisk: A Visual Question Answering Dataset for Agent-Level Risk
  Assessment in Autonomous Driving
Authors: Yuan Gao, Mattia Piccinini, Roberto Brusnicki, Yuchen Zhang, Johannes
  Betz
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

Title: Automated Model Discovery via Multi-modal & Multi-step Pipeline
Authors: Lee Jung-Mok, Nam Hyeon-Woo, Moon Ye-Bin, Junhyun Nam, Tae-Hyun Oh
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

Title: RoRecomp: Enhancing Reasoning Efficiency via Rollout Response
  Recomposition in Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Gang Li, Yulei Qin, Xiaoyu Tan, Dingkang Yang, Yuchen Shi, Zihan Xu,

Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

Title: Scalable and Robust LLM Unlearning by Correcting Responses with
  Retrieved Exclusions
Authors: Junbeom Kim, Kyuyoung Kim, Jihoon Tack, Dongha Lim, Jinwoo Shin
Categories: cs.AI
ACM-class: I.2.6
\\
  Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

Title: Towards Unified Multimodal Misinformation Detection in Social Media: A
  Benchmark Dataset and Baseline
Authors: Haiyang Li, Yaxiong Wang, Lianwei Wu, Lechao Cheng, Zhun Zhong
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Title: CoLLM-NAS: Collaborative Large Language Models for Efficient
  Knowledge-Guided Neural Architecture Search
Authors: Zhe Li, Zhiwei Lin, Yongtao Wang
Categories: cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

Title: Evaluating the Use of Large Language Models as Synthetic Social Agents
  in Social Science Research
Authors: Emma Rose Madden
Categories: cs.AI stat.AP
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

Title: SafeEvalAgent: Toward Agentic and Self-Evolving Safety Evaluation of
  LLMs
Authors: Yixu Wang, Xin Wang, Yang Yao, Xinyuan Li, Yan Teng, Xingjun Ma,
  Yingchun Wang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

  Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

Title: LMILAtt: A Deep Learning Model for Depression Detection from Social
  Media Users Enhanced by Multi-Instance Learning Based on Attention Mechanism
Authors: Yukun Yang
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

  Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

Title: 90% Faster, 100% Code-Free: MLLM-Driven Zero-Code 3D Game Development
Authors: Runxin Yang, Yuxuan Wan, Shuqing Li, Michael R. Lyu
Categories: cs.AI cs.SE
\\
  Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

Title: 'Too much alignment; not enough culture': Re-balancing cultural
  alignment practices in LLMs
Authors: Eric J. W. Orlowski, Hakim Norhashim and Tristan Koh Ly Wey
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 8 pages, no figures
\\
  While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

Title: Human-Centered Evaluation of RAG outputs: a framework and questionnaire
  for human-AI collaboration
Authors: Aline Mangold, Kiran Hoffmann
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

  Variable-Length LLM Training
Authors: Yuliang Liu, Guohao Wu, Shenglong Zhang, Wei Zhang, Qianchao Zhu,
  Zhouyang Li, Chenyu Wang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

  Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Comments: The code will be released later
\\
  Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Title: AI Playing Business Games: Benchmarking Large Language Models on
  Managerial Decision-Making in Dynamic Simulations
Authors: Berdymyrat Ovezmyradov
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 34 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables
ACM-class: I.2.1
\\
  The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

Title: SafeBehavior: Simulating Human-Like Multistage Reasoning to Mitigate
  Jailbreak Attacks in Large Language Models
Authors: Qinjian Zhao, Jiaqi Wang, Zhiqiang Gao, Zhihao Dou, Belal Abuhaija,
  Kaizhu Huang
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 27 pages, 5 figure
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

  Real-World Benchmarks ?

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

\\
  Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/ShaoShuai0605/Misevolution . Warning: this paper includes

Title: MC-GNNAS-Dock: Multi-criteria GNN-based Algorithm Selection for
  Molecular Docking
Authors: Siyuan Cao, Hongxuan Wu, Jiabao Brad Wang, Yiliang Yuan, Mustafa Misir
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Short paper. Preprint of a forthcoming conference contribution
\\
  Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

\\
  With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

Title: OntoAligner Meets Knowledge Graph Embedding Aligners

Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 10 pages of main content, 3 page references, 3 figures. Accepted to
  Ontology Matching Workshop at ISWC
\\
  Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

Title: Transformer Classification of Breast Lesions: The BreastDCEDL_AMBL
  Benchmark Dataset and 0.92 AUC Baseline
Authors: Naomi Fridman (Ariel University), Anat Goldstein (Ariel University)
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

  CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

  A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

Title: STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework
  for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models
Authors: Shaoxiong Guo, Tianyi Du, Lijun Li, Yuyao Wu, Jie Li, Jing Shao
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

Title: The Average Patient Fallacy
Authors: Alaleh Azhir, Shawn N. Murphy, Hossein Estiri
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

  Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

  Always!

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

  We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

Authors: Jovan Stojkovic, Chaojie Zhang, \'I\~nigo Goiri, Ricardo Bianchini
Categories: cs.AI cs.AR cs.DC
\\
  The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

Title: HilbertA: Hilbert Attention for Image Generation with Diffusion Models
Authors: Shaoyi Zheng, Wenbo Lu, Yuxuan Xia, Haomin Liu, Shengjie Wang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

  While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

Title: Fairness Testing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation: How Small
  Perturbations Reveal Bias in Small Language Models
Authors: Matheus Vinicius da Silva de Oliveira, Jonathan de Andrade Silva,
  Awdren de Lima Fontao
Categories: cs.AI cs.IR cs.LG cs.SE
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

Title: Fine-tuning Behavioral Cloning Policies with Preference-Based
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Ma\"el Macuglia, Paul Friedrich, Giorgia Ramponi
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 85 pages (11 + references and appendix), 9 figures
\\
  Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

Title: TimeRewarder: Learning Dense Reward from Passive Videos via Frame-wise
  Temporal Distance
Authors: Yuyang Liu, Chuan Wen, Yihang Hu, Dinesh Jayaraman, Yang Gao
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO
\\
  Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Title: Branching Out: Broadening AI Measurement and Evaluation with Measurement
  Trees
Authors: Craig Greenberg, Patrick Hall, Theodore Jensen, Kristen Greene, Razvan
  Amironesei
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

Title: Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional
  Regeneration in AI
Authors: Eduard Kapelko
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: Code is available at:
  https://www.kaggle.com/code/kapedalex/cycleablationpublic/
\\
  Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

  This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

Title: Generative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities
Authors: Andy Liu, Kshitish Ghate, Mona Diab, Daniel Fried, Atoosa Kasirzadeh,
  Max Kleiman-Weiner
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

Title: From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think
  Critically
Authors: Qiyao Ma, Yunsheng Shi, Hongtao Tian, Chao Wang, Weiming Chang, Ting
  Yao
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

  Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

  Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

Title: Not Wrong, But Untrue: LLM Overconfidence in Document-Based Queries
Authors: Nick Hagar, Wilma Agustianto, and Nicholas Diakopoulos
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Accepted to Computation + Journalism Symposium 2025
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

Title: Beyond WER: Probing Whisper's Sub-token Decoder Across Diverse Language
  Resource Levels
Authors: Siyu Liang, Nicolas Ballier, Gina-Anne Levow, Richard Wright
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

  We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

Title: Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors
Authors: Victor Wang, Elias Stengel-Eskin
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Code: https://github.com/dubai03nsr/dinco
\\
  Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

  Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

Title: Aligning Multilingual Reasoning with Verifiable Semantics from a
  High-Resource Expert Model
Authors: Fahim Faisal, Kaiqiang Song, Song Wang, Simin Ma, Shujian Liu, Haoyun
  Deng, Sathish Reddy Indurthi
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

Title: Performance and competence intertwined: A computational model of the
  Null Subject stage in English-speaking children
Authors: Soumik Dey, William Gregory Sakas
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

Title: Don't Sweat the Small Stuff: Segment-Level Meta-Evaluation Based on
  Pairwise Difference Correlation
Authors: Colten DiIanni, Daniel Deutsch
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

Title: Probing the Limits of Stylistic Alignment in Vision-Language Models
Authors: Asma Farajidizaji, Akash Gupta, Vatsal Raina
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables
\\
  Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

Title: RFG: Test-Time Scaling for Diffusion Large Language Model Reasoning with
  Reward-Free Guidance
Authors: Tianlang Chen, Minkai Xu, Jure Leskovec, Stefano Ermon
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: 27 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

Title: Transformers through the lens of support-preserving maps between
  measures
Authors: Takashi Furuya, Maarten V. de Hoop, Matti Lassas
Categories: cs.CL stat.ML
\\
  Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

Title: The Media Bias Detector: A Framework for Annotating and Analyzing the
  News at Scale
Authors: Samar Haider, Amir Tohidi, Jenny S. Wang, Timothy D\"orr, David M.
  Rothschild, Chris Callison-Burch, Duncan J. Watts
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

Title: QFrBLiMP: a Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs
Authors: David Beauchemin, Pier-Luc Veilleux, Richard Khoury, Johanna-Pascale

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Submitted to LREC 2026
\\
  In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

Title: The Flaw of Averages: Quantifying Uniformity of Performance on
  Benchmarks
Authors: Arda Uzunoglu, Tianjian Li, Daniel Khashabi
Categories: cs.CL cs.SE
\\
  Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

Title: Mitigating Biases in Language Models via Bias Unlearning
Authors: Dianqing Liu, Yi Liu, Guoqing Jin, Zhendong Mao
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP 2025 MainConference
\\
  Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

Title: LD-MoLE: Learnable Dynamic Routing for Mixture of LoRA Experts
Authors: Yuan Zhuang, Yi Shen, Yuexin Bian, Qing Su, Shihao Ji, Yuanyuan Shi,

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

  Abilities

  Yangning Li, Xiaoyu Tan, Chao Qu, Meishan Zhang, Ying Shen, Philip S. Yu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic
thinking".

  Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this

generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes

prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text
generation in sensitive domains.

\\
  Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

  The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple

Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all
languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech
detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation

  While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

\\
  This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

\\
  In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
their performance in domain-specific applications and non-English languages
remains less explored. This study introduces a novel Romanian-language dataset
for multiple-choice biology questions, carefully curated to assess LLM
comprehension and reasoning capabilities in scientific contexts. Containing
approximately 14,000 questions, the dataset provides a comprehensive resource
for evaluating and improving LLM performance in biology.
  We benchmark several popular LLMs, analyzing their accuracy, reasoning
patterns, and ability to understand domain-specific terminology and linguistic
nuances. Additionally, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the
impact of prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and other optimization techniques on
model performance. Our findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs in handling specialized knowledge tasks in low-resource languages,
offering valuable insights for future research and development.

Title: ReTAG: Retrieval-Enhanced, Topic-Augmented Graph-Based Global
  Sensemaking

  Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in
tasks such as multi-hop reasoning. However, global sensemaking-answering
questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,
Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and
retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time
compared to the baseline. Our code is available at

  We study personalized figure caption generation using author profile data

Title: Overthinking Reduction with Decoupled Rewards and Curriculum Data
  Scheduling
Authors: Shuyang Jiang, Yusheng Liao, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 26 pages
\\
  While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

Title: Believing without Seeing: Quality Scores for Contextualizing
  Vision-Language Model Explanations
Authors: Keyu He, Tejas Srinivasan, Brihi Joshi, Xiang Ren, Jesse Thomason,
  Swabha Swayamdipta
Categories: cs.CL cs.HC
\\
  When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently confabulate scientific facts,severely
undermining their trustworthiness. Addressing this challenge requires
benchmarks that go beyond binary factuality and enable fine-grained evaluation.
We introduce \textbf{ReFACT} (\textit{Reddit False And Correct Texts}), a
benchmark of 1,001 expert-annotated question--answer pairs spanning diverse
scientific domains for the detection of scientific confabulation. Each instance
includes both a scientifically correct answer and a non-factual counterpart
annotated with \textbf{precise error spans and error-types}. ReFACT enables
multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error
localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,
raising concerns about the reliability of \textit{LLM-as-judge} evaluation
paradigms. Our findings highlight the need for fine-grained, human-validated
benchmarks to detect and correct scientific confabulation in domain-specific
contexts. Dataset is released on
\href{https://github.com/ddz5431/ReFACT}{GitHub}\footnote{We provide the

  We investigate the robustness of Whisper-based automatic speech recognition

Sundanese. While recent work has demonstrated strong ASR performance under
clean conditions, their effectiveness in noisy environments remains unclear. To
address this, we experiment with multiple training strategies, including
synthetic noise augmentation and SpecAugment, and evaluate performance across a
range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our results show that noise-aware
training substantially improves robustness, particularly for larger Whisper
models. A detailed error analysis further reveals language-specific challenges,
highlighting avenues for future improvements

Title: RoleConflictBench: A Benchmark of Role Conflict Scenarios for Evaluating
  LLMs' Contextual Sensitivity
Authors: Jisu Shin, Hoyun Song, Juhyun Oh, Changgeon Ko, Eunsu Kim, Chani Jung,

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.CY
\\
  Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

Title: PerQ: Efficient Evaluation of Multilingual Text Personalization Quality
Authors: Dominik Macko, Andrew Pulver
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

Title: Mem-{\alpha}: Learning Memory Construction via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yu Wang, Ryuichi Takanobu, Zhiqi Liang, Yuzhen Mao, Yuanzhe Hu, Julian
  McAuley, Xiaojian Wu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

Title: Bringing Emerging Architectures to Sequence Labeling in NLP

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

\\
  Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free

our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

  Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

Title: RE$^2$: Improving Chinese Grammatical Error Correction via Retrieving
  Appropriate Examples with Explanation
Authors: Baoxin Wang, Yumeng Luo, Yixuan Wang, Dayong Wu, Wanxiang Che, Shijin
  Wang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

  Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the

  Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at

Title: The Silent Judge: Unacknowledged Shortcut Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
Authors: Arash Marioriyad and Mohammad Hossein Rohban and Mahdieh Soleymani
  Baghshah
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 9 Pages, 5 Tables, 1 Figures
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge

Title: Limited Preference Data? Learning Better Reward Model with Latent Space
  Synthesis
Authors: Leitian Tao, Xuefeng Du, Yixuan Li
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted by NeurIPS 2025
\\
  Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.
Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We
propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the
LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By
performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to
the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent
synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We
provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately
preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.
Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based
augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x
faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a
scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through
efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at

  As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will
continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the
mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next
generation of LLMs.

Title: Reinforced Strategy Optimization for Conversational Recommender Systems
  via Network-of-Experts
Authors: Xiaoyan Zhao
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become
promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield
suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a
hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level
strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A
Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an
Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and
factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To
address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement
learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of
hierarchical strategy optimization.

  We present a scalable large language model (LLM)-based system that combines
aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) with guided summarization to generate
concise and interpretable product review summaries for the Wayfair platform.
Our approach first extracts and consolidates aspect-sentiment pairs from
individual reviews, selects the most frequent aspects for each product, and
samples representative reviews accordingly. These are used to construct
structured prompts that guide the LLM to produce summaries grounded in actual
customer feedback. We demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of our system
through a large-scale online A/B test. Furthermore, we describe our real-time
deployment strategy and release a dataset of 11.8 million anonymized customer
reviews covering 92,000 products, including extracted aspects and generated
summaries, to support future research in aspect-guided review summarization.

Title: Vocabulary Customization for Efficient Domain-Specific LLM Deployment
Authors: Christian Herold and Michael Kozielski and Nicholas Santavas and
  Yannick Versley and Shahram Khadivi
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted at NEURIPS 2025 CCFM Workshop
\\
  When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often
overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer
fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token
fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word
splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set
of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an
existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization
efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of
tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer
significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference
latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further
analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the
rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the
broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

  LLM-based multi-agent systems demonstrate great potential for tackling
complex problems, but how competition shapes their behavior remains
underexplored. This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent
debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful
behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this
phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental
framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our
experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that
competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and
degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore
the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating
that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the
over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and
form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for
understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

  The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of
distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As
LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and
resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less
effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with
new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes
VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global
thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have
constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal
thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our
experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two
domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It
outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and
other state-of-the-art approaches, including commercial tools such as ZeroGPT
and DetectGPT, especially under specially modified prompting strategies.

  In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

\\
  Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share

Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

Title: Optimizing Speech Language Models for Acoustic Consistency
Authors: Morteza Rohanian and Michael Krauthammer
Categories: cs.CL cs.SD
\\
  We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and
planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach
initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light
alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target
robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only
model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text
and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the
highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background
factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic
probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes
show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while
trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training
mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding
without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model
weights are available for exploration.

  Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various
zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

Title: Feedback Forensics: A Toolkit to Measure AI Personality
Authors: Arduin Findeis, Timo Kaufmann, Eyke H\"ullermeier, Robert Mullins
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

Title: One-Token Rollout: Guiding Supervised Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Policy
  Gradient
Authors: Rui Ming, Haoyuan Wu, Shoubo Hu, Zhuolun He, Bei Yu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large
language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to
reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance
disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental
difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes
on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we
introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides
SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning
process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement
learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by
sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The
ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward
signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes
static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the
token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while
bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive
experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that
OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a
powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling
evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of
generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

Title: Latent Thinking Optimization: Your Latent Reasoning Language Model
  Secretly Encodes Reward Signals in its Latent Thoughts
Authors: Hanwen Du and Yuxin Dong and Xia Ning
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of
thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally
costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent
thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning
steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack
interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the
correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and
how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We
show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit
highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably
predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these
insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic
algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to
optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse
reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect
latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking
processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,
and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking
processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward
modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed
directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,
efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of
LLMs.

  Liu, Pavlo Molchanov, Ping Luo, Song Han, Enze Xie
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent
sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose
Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that
efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text
generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This
represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention
diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original
model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that
combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,
enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR
training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical
caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context
representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient
parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel
decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR
decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR
baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs
- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and
accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

  Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

  Factuality assesses the extent to which a language utterance relates to
real-world information; it determines whether utterances correspond to facts,
possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for
fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple
linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that
combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for
Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present
a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that
we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator
agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict
(some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large
corpus.

Title: Text-Based Approaches to Item Alignment to Content Standards in
  Large-Scale Reading & Writing Tests
Authors: Yanbin Fu, Hong Jiao, Tianyi Zhou, Robert W. Lissitz, Nan Zhang, Ming

\\
  Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

Title: Adaptive Planning for Multi-Attribute Controllable Summarization with
  Monte Carlo Tree Search
Authors: Sangwon Ryu, Heejin Do, Yunsu Kim, Gary Geunbae Lee, Jungseul Ok
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

Title: CreAgentive: An Agent Workflow Driven Multi-Category Creative Generation
  Engine
Authors: Yuyang Cheng, Linyue Cai, Changwei Peng, Yumiao Xu, Rongfang Bie, Yong

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative
generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large
language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives:
restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative
coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core,
CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge
graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic
realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic
triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an
Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a
Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent
dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages
this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as
retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy
and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive
experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality
and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone
model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10
narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that
CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust
performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored
novels.

Title: Regression Language Models for Code

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG cs.PF cs.SE
\\
  We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

Title: dParallel: Learnable Parallel Decoding for dLLMs
Authors: Zigeng Chen, Gongfan Fang, Xinyin Ma, Ruonan Yu, Xinchao Wang
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Working in progress, code base: https://github.com/czg1225/dParallel
\\
  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable
attention within the research community as a promising alternative to
autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower
inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely
underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length
decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,
a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs
for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding
arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on
this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing
distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its
original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on
masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the
number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the
LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on
GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP
benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup
while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at

  As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn
conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,
enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve
as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical
real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at

Title: BatonVoice: An Operationalist Framework for Enhancing Controllable
  Speech Synthesis with Linguistic Intelligence from LLMs

  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with
speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches
often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically
failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This
limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for
controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm
inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from
speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a
``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual
``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS
model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To
realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically
for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong
performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming
strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables
remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature
control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates
that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively
unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

Title: Training Matryoshka Mixture-of-Experts for Elastic Inference-Time Expert
  Utilization
Authors: Yaoxiang Wang, Qingguo Hu, Yucheng Ding, Ruizhe Wang, Yeyun Gong, Jian
  Jiao, Yelong Shen, Peng Cheng, Jinsong Su
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

  We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are

Comments: Accepted to BlackBoxNLP 2025
\\
  Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

Title: Towards Reliable Benchmarking: A Contamination Free, Controllable
  Evaluation Framework for Multi-step LLM Function Calling
Authors: Seiji Maekawa, Jackson Hassell, Pouya Pezeshkpour, Tom Mitchell,
  Estevam Hruschka
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  As language models gain access to external tools via structured function
calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step
tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)
provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions
accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data
contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework
that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key
idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG
where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one
function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function
schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose
the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows
users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,
and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our
FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying
difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose
models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance
declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected
irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong
models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or
stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in
multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple
mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent
at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains
across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%
for GPT-5.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly
obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation
models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is
better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult
test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of
identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and
languages.

Title: Deconstructing Self-Bias in LLM-generated Translation Benchmarks
Authors: Wenda Xu, Sweta Agrawal, Vil\'em Zouhar, Markus Freitag, Daniel
  Deutsch
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

  Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

  While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often

a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific

  NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

Title: Scaling Spoken Language Models with Syllabic Speech Tokenization
Authors: Nicholas Lee, Cheol Jun Cho, Alan W Black, Gopala K. Anumanchipalli
Categories: cs.CL eess.AS
\\
  Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into
high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful
LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token
streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically
with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of
speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more
scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their
value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the
first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,
evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data
scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens
while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a
2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings
highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient
long-context spoken language models.

Title: Convergence and Divergence of Language Models under Different Random
  Seeds
Authors: Finlay Fehlauer (1), Kyle Mahowald (2), Tiago Pimentel (1) ((1) ETH

Comments: Published at EMNLP 2025
\\
  In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.

Title: LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring
  for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model
Authors: Haozhe Jia, Wenshuo Chen, Yuqi Lin, Yang Yang, Lei Wang, Mang Ning,
  Bowen Tian, Songning Lai, Nanqian Jia, Yifan Chen, and Yutao Yue
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

  Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

Title: Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations
Authors: Tianwen Zhou, Akshay Paruchuri, Josef Spjut, Kaan Ak\c{s}it
Categories: cs.CV cs.HC cs.MM
Comments: 12 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables
\\
  Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

Title: SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in
  VLMs
Authors: Yuyou Zhang, Radu Corcodel, Chiori Hori, Anoop Cherian, Ding Zhao
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

  Deformation in Eastern Ireland

  Sensing for reviewing
\\
  Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

Title: Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and
  Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data
Authors: Mabel Heffring and Lincoln Linlin Xu
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

\\
  Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

Title: Seeing Before Reasoning: A Unified Framework for Generalizable and
  Explainable Fake Image Detection
Authors: Kaiqing Lin, Zhiyuan Yan, Ruoxin Chen, Junyan Ye, Ke-Yue Zhang, Yue
  Zhou, Peng Jin, Bin Li, Taiping Yao, Shouhong Ding
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

Title: DeepFake Detection in Dyadic Video Calls using Point of Gaze Tracking
Authors: Odin Kohler, Rahul Vijaykumar, Masudul H. Imtiaz
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

Title: LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language
  Models
Authors: Pranav Saxena, Avigyan Bhattacharya, Ji Zhang, Wenshan Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.RO
\\
  Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

Title: VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision
  Language Models
Authors: Ravikumar Balakrishnan, Mansi Phute
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

  Self-Play
Authors: Qinsi Wang, Bo Liu, Tianyi Zhou, Jing Shi, Yueqian Lin, Yiran Chen,

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

\\
  Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development
and evaluation of specialized vision-language models capable of advancing
aquatic science.

  Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

Title: MetaChest: Generalized few-shot learning of patologies from chest X-rays
Authors: Berenice Montalvo-Lezama, Gibran Fuentes-Pineda
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

Title: K-Prism: A Knowledge-Guided and Prompt Integrated Universal Medical
  Image Segmentation Model
Authors: Bangwei Guo, Yunhe Gao, Meng Ye, Difei Gu, Yang Zhou, Leon Axel,
  Dimitris Metaxas
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

Title: GaussianLens: Localized High-Resolution Reconstruction via On-Demand
  Gaussian Densification
Authors: Yijia Weng, Zhicheng Wang, Songyou Peng, Saining Xie, Howard Zhou,
  Leonidas J. Guibas
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

  Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

Title: Anchor-free Cross-view Object Geo-localization with Gaussian Position
  Encoding and Cross-view Association
Authors: Xingtao Ling and Chenlin Fu and Yingying Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Comments: Accepted to NeurIPS 2025
\\
  Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Title: Using Images from a Video Game to Improve the Detection of Truck Axles
Authors: Leandro Arab Marcomini, Andre Luiz Cunha
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

Title: DescribeEarth: Describe Anything for Remote Sensing Images
Authors: Kaiyu Li, Zixuan Jiang, Xiangyong Cao, Jiayu Wang, Yuchen Xiao, Deyu

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

\\
  In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

Title: OmniDFA: A Unified Framework for Open Set Synthesis Image Detection and
  Few-Shot Attribution
Authors: Shiyu Wu, Shuyan Li, Jing Li, Jing Liu, Yequan Wang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 19 pages, 5 figures
\\
  AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

  Vision-Language Reasoning
Authors: Xiping Li, Jianghong Ma

Comments: 22 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICLR 2026
\\
  Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

Title: How Diffusion Models Memorize
Authors: Juyeop Kim, Songkuk Kim, Jong-Seok Lee
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

Authors: Yuan Gao, Sangwook Kim, Jianzhong You and Chris McIntosh

Comments: ICCV 2025
\\
  Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities--chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text--into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

Comments: Preprint
\\
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method

Title: LaTo: Landmark-tokenized Diffusion Transformer for Fine-grained Human
  Face Editing
Authors: Zhenghao Zhang and Ziying Zhang and Junchao Liao and Xiangyu Meng and
  Qiang Hu and Siyu Zhu and Xiaoyun Zhang and Long Qin and Weizhi Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Title: The 1st Solution for MOSEv1 Challenge on LSVOS 2025: CGFSeg
Authors: Tingmin Li and Yixuan Li and Yang Yang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in
complex scenarios.

Title: LieHMR: Autoregressive Human Mesh Recovery with $SO(3)$ Diffusion
Authors: Donghwan Kim, Tae-Kyun Kim
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 17 pages, 13 figures
\\
  We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

Title: Dragging with Geometry: From Pixels to Geometry-Guided Image Editing
Authors: Xinyu Pu, Hongsong Wang, Jie Gui, Pan Zhou
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

Title: IPDRecon: Image-Plane Geometric Decoding for View-Invariant Indoor Scene
  Reconstruction
Authors: Mingyang Li, Yimeng Fan, Changsong Liu, Tianyu Zhou, Xin Wang, Yanyan
  Liu, Wei Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

  We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound

Title: ART-VITON: Measurement-Guided Latent Diffusion for Artifact-Free Virtual
  Try-On
Authors: Junseo Park and Hyeryung Jang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 21 pages
\\
  Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Title: Free Lunch Alignment of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models without
  Preference Image Pairs

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

  AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

Title: PCPO: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization for Aligning Image
  Generation Models
Authors: Jeongjae Lee, Jong Chul Ye
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 24 pages, 17 figures
\\
  While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

Title: Editable Noise Map Inversion: Encoding Target-image into Noise For
  High-Fidelity Image Manipulation
Authors: Mingyu Kang, Yong Suk Choi
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: ICML 2025
\\
  Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

  Voting and Ranking
Authors: Wen Wen, Tianwu Zhi, Kanglong Fan, Yang Li, Xinge Peng, Yabin Zhang,

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Under Review
\\
  Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

  Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

  Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

  Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the state-
of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing data, we
organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023. The
training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

  In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

Title: Training-Free Reward-Guided Image Editing via Trajectory Optimal Control
Authors: Jinho Chang, Jaemin Kim, Jong Chul Ye
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 18 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

Title: More Thought, Less Accuracy? On the Dual Nature of Reasoning in
  Vision-Language Models
Authors: Xinyu Tian, Shu Zou, Zhaoyuan Yang, Mengqi He, Fabian Waschkowski,
  Lukas Wesemann, Peter Tu, Jing Zhang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

  Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All
data and code are publicly available at https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR.

Title: PatchEAD: Unifying Industrial Visual Prompting Frameworks for
  Patch-Exclusive Anomaly Detection

Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Title: LiDAR Point Cloud Colourisation Using Multi-Camera Fusion and Low-Light
  Image Enhancement
Authors: Pasindu Ranasinghe, Dibyayan Patra, Bikram Banerjee, Simit Raval
Categories: cs.CV cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

Title: MAPLE: Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning for Few-shot Whole
  Slide Image Classification
Authors: Junjie Zhou, Wei Shao, Yagao Yue, Wei Mu, Peng Wan, Qi Zhu, Daoqiang
  Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

Title: DeepSketcher: Internalizing Visual Manipulation for Multimodal Reasoning
Authors: Chi Zhang, Haibo Qiu, Qiming Zhang, Zhixiong Zeng, Lin Ma, Jing Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

  We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation
annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation.
mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across
multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the
first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts
and prompt-conditioned routing. We have included our source code in the
supplementary materials and will release our dataset upon publication.

Title: LLaVAShield: Safeguarding Multimodal Multi-Turn Dialogues in
  Vision-Language Models
Authors: Guolei Huang, Qingzhi Peng, Gan Xu, Yuxuan Lu, Yongjun Shen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

Title: VLM-FO1: Bridging the Gap Between High-Level Reasoning and Fine-Grained
  Perception in VLMs
Authors: Peng Liu, Haozhan Shen, Chunxin Fang, Zhicheng Sun, Jiajia Liao,

Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
Comments: 22 pages
\\
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

\\
  Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Title: UniMMAD: Unified Multi-Modal and Multi-Class Anomaly Detection via
  MoE-Driven Feature Decompression
Authors: Yuan Zhao, Youwei Pang, Lihe Zhang, Hanqi Liu, Jiaming Zuo, Huchuan
  Lu, Xiaoqi Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: manuscript
\\
  Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

Title: CO3: Contrasting Concepts Compose Better

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

  Medical Report Generation

  Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

\\
  Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available

\\
  Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on

Title: Towards Reliable and Holistic Visual In-Context Learning Prompt

\\
  Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

Title: VRWKV-Editor: Reducing quadratic complexity in transformer-based video
  editing
Authors: Abdelilah Aitrouga and Youssef Hmamouche and Amal El Fallah

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Title: Learning Egocentric In-Hand Object Segmentation through Weak Supervision
  from Human Narrations
Authors: Nicola Messina, Rosario Leonardi, Luca Ciampi, Fabio Carrara, Giovanni
  Maria Farinella, Fabrizio Falchi, Antonino Furnari
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

Title: AgenticIQA: An Agentic Framework for Adaptive and Interpretable Image
  Quality Assessment
Authors: Hanwei Zhu, Yu Tian, Keyan Ding, Baoliang Chen, Bolin Chen, Shiqi
  Wang, Weisi Lin
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

  Distortion-aware Gaussian-Splatted Volumetric Fusion

DOI: 10.1145/3746027.3755159
\\
  In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

Title: New Fourth-Order Grayscale Indicator-Based Telegraph Diffusion Model for
  Image Despeckling
Authors: Rajendra K. Ray, Manish Kumar
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

Title: SETR: A Two-Stage Semantic-Enhanced Framework for Zero-Shot Composed
  Image Retrieval
Authors: Yuqi Xiao, Yingying Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
ACM-class: I.4.9
\\
  Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

Title: GeoLink: Empowering Remote Sensing Foundation Model with OpenStreetMap
  Data

Comments: NeurIPS 2025
\\
  Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

Title: PatchVSR: Breaking Video Diffusion Resolution Limits with Patch-wise
  Video Super-Resolution
Authors: Shian Du, Menghan Xia, Chang Liu, Xintao Wang, Jing Wang, Pengfei Wan,
  Di Zhang, Xiangyang Ji
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: CVPR 2025
\\
  Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

Title: Causally Guided Gaussian Perturbations for Out-Of-Distribution
  Generalization in Medical Imaging
Authors: Haoran Pei, Yuguang Yang, Kexin Liu and Baochang Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

\\
  While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available
at

Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures
\\
  We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures
\\
  The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at

  Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

Title: EasyOcc: 3D Pseudo-Label Supervision for Fully Self-Supervised Semantic
  Occupancy Prediction Models
Authors: Seamie Hayes, Ganesh Sistu, Ciar\'an Eising
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Title: Predicting Penalty Kick Direction Using Multi-Modal Deep Learning with
  Pose-Guided Attention
Authors: Pasindu Ranasinghe, Pamudu Ranasinghe
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

\\
  Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D

struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning

Title: EVODiff: Entropy-aware Variance Optimized Diffusion Inference
Authors: Shigui Li, Wei Chen, Delu Zeng
Categories: cs.CV cs.IT cs.LG math.IT math.OC stat.ML
Comments: NeurIPS 2025, 40 pages, 14 figures
\\
  Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

Title: EchoGen: Generating Visual Echoes in Any Scene via Feed-Forward
  Subject-Driven Auto-Regressive Model
Authors: Ruixiao Dong, Zhendong Wang, Keli Liu, Li Li, Ying Chen, Kai Li,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

Title: EntroPE: Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder for Time Series
  Forecasting
Authors: Sachith Abeywickrama, Emadeldeen Eldele, Min Wu, Xiaoli Li, Chau Yuen
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Preprint. Under Review
\\
  Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Title: Towards Continual Expansion of Data Coverage: Automatic Text-guided
  Edge-case Synthesis
Authors: Kyeongryeol Go
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures
\\
  The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a
scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated,
targeted synthesis, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable
and continuously improving AI systems. Code is available at

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

  Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose--including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation--as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

  We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

  In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

\\
  Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

\\
  In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

Title: Generalized Fine-Grained Category Discovery with Multi-Granularity
  Conceptual Experts
Authors: Haiyang Zheng, Nan Pu, Wenjing Li, Nicu Sebe, Zhun Zhong
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is
available at https://github.com/HaiyangZheng/MGCE.

Title: IMG: Calibrating Diffusion Models via Implicit Multimodal Guidance
Authors: Jiayi Guo, Chuanhao Yan, Xingqian Xu, Yulin Wang, Kai Wang, Gao Huang,
  and Humphrey Shi
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ICCV 2025
\\
  Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Comments: Accepted at Workshop on Machine Learning in Document Analysis and

\\
  Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

  Dynamic Awareness for VLA
Authors: Zhejia Cai, Yandan Yang, Xinyuan Chang, Shiyi Liang, Ronghan Chen,
  Feng Xiong, Mu Xu, Ruqi Huang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision- Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action rep- resentations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry- aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end- to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates
structured perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly
reason about environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and
interpretability. We validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation
and real- world settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results
demonstrate that our strategy of combining geometry- aware modeling, temporal
coherence, and explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Title: PRPO: Paragraph-level Policy Optimization for Vision-Language Deepfake
  Detection
Authors: Tuan Nguyen, Naseem Khan, Khang Tran, NhatHai Phan, Issa Khalil
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

Title: Cat: Post-training quantization error reduction via cluster-based affine
  transformation
Authors: Ali Zoljodi, Radu Timofte and Masoud Daneshtalab
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 29 pages, 20 figures
\\
  Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

  Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like
feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an
AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight
generative vision-language modeling as a powerful new direction for skill
assessment.

  Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

Title: FLOWER: A Flow-Matching Solver for Inverse Problems
Authors: Mehrsa Pourya, Bassam El Rawas, Michael Unser
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

Title: Continuous Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with 3D Fourier Fields
Authors: Alexander Becker, Julius Erbach, Dominik Narnhofer, Konrad Schindler
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

  Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Title: EditReward: A Human-Aligned Reward Model for Instruction-Guided Image
  Editing

Comments: Work in progress. Project Page:

\\
  Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

Title: TimeScope: Towards Task-Oriented Temporal Grounding In Long Videos
Authors: Xiangrui Liu, Minghao Qin, Yan Shu, Zhengyang Liang, Yang Tian, Chen
  Jason Zhang, Bo Zhao, Zheng Liu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

Title: Go with Your Gut: Scaling Confidence for Autoregressive Image Generation
Authors: Harold Haodong Chen, Xianfeng Wu, Wen-Jie Shu, Rongjin Guo, Disen Lan,

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Code: https://github.com/EnVision-Research/ScalingAR
\\
  Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

Title: PANDA: Towards Generalist Video Anomaly Detection via Agentic AI
  Engineer
Authors: Zhiwei Yang, Chen Gao, Mike Zheng Shou
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by NeurIPS 2025
\\
  Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

Title: MotionRAG: Motion Retrieval-Augmented Image-to-Video Generation
Authors: Chenhui Zhu, Yilu Wu, Shuai Wang, Gangshan Wu, Limin Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

Title: Image-Difficulty-Aware Evaluation of Super-Resolution Models
Authors: Atakan Topaloglu, Ahmet Bilican, Cansu Korkmaz, A. Murat Tekalp
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to and presented at ICIP 2025 Workshops
\\
  Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

  Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

Title: Post-Training Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
  for Diffusion Models
Authors: Donghoon Kim, Dongyoung Lee, Ik Joon Chang, and Sung-Ho Bae
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

Title: Multi-View Camera System for Variant-Aware Autonomous Vehicle Inspection
  and Defect Detection
Authors: Yash Kulkarni, Raman Jha, Renu Kachhoria
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

Title: Stylos: Multi-View 3D Stylization with Single-Forward Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Hanzhou Liu, Jia Huang, Mi Lu, Srikanth Saripalli, Peng Jiang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

\\
  Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

Title: CBAM Integrated Attention Driven Model For Betel Leaf Diseases
  Classification With Explainable AI
Authors: Sumaiya Tabassum, Md. Faysal Ahamed
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.SP
\\
  We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

\\
  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

Title: DEPTHOR++: Robust Depth Enhancement from a Real-World Lightweight dToF
  and RGB Guidance

Comments: 15 pages, 16 figures
\\
  Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

  Developing autonomous agents that effectively interact with Graphic User
Interfaces (GUIs) remains a challenging open problem, especially for small
on-device models. In this paper, we present Ferret-UI Lite, a compact,
end-to-end GUI agent that operates across diverse platforms, including mobile,
web, and desktop. Utilizing techniques optimized for developing small models,
we build our 3B Ferret-UI Lite agent through curating a diverse GUI data
mixture from real and synthetic sources, strengthening inference-time
performance through chain-of-thought reasoning and visual tool-use, and
reinforcement learning with designed rewards. Ferret-UI Lite achieves
competitive performance with other small-scale GUI agents. In GUI grounding,
Ferret-UI Lite attains scores of $91.6\%$, $53.3\%$, and $61.2\%$ on the
ScreenSpot-V2, ScreenSpot-Pro, and OSWorld-G benchmarks, respectively. For GUI
navigation, Ferret-UI Lite achieves success rates of $28.0\%$ on AndroidWorld
and $19.8\%$ on OSWorld. We share our methods and lessons learned from
developing compact, on-device GUI agents.

  Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

Title: Autoproof: Automated Segmentation Proofreading for Connectomics
Authors: Gary B Huang, William M Katz, Stuart Berg, Louis Scheffer
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

Title: DiffCamera: Arbitrary Refocusing on Images
Authors: Yiyang Wang, Xi Chen, Xiaogang Xu, Yu Liu, Hengshuang Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
DOI: 10.1145/3757377.3763827
\\
  The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

  Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Title: Hy-Facial: Hybrid Feature Extraction by Dimensionality Reduction Methods
  for Enhanced Facial Expression Classification
Authors: Xinjin Li, Yu Ma, Kaisen Ye, Jinghan Cao, Minghao Zhou, Yeyang Zhou
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

  Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Project page: https://xiyichen.github.io/hart
\\
  We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

Title: Learning Generalizable Shape Completion with SIM(3) Equivariance
Authors: Yuqing Wang, Zhaiyu Chen, Xiao Xiang Zhu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: NeurIPS 2025
\\
  3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

  Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

  Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Preprint
\\
  Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

  Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU

Title: Permuting Transactions in Ethereum Blocks: An Empirical Study
Authors: Jan Droll
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures, experiment code available
\\
  Several recent proposals implicitly or explicitly suggest making use of
randomized transaction ordering within a block to mitigate centralization
effects and to improve fairness in the Ethereum ecosystem. However,
transactions and blocks are subject to gas limits and protocol rules. In a
randomized transaction order, the behavior of transactions may change depending
on other transactions in the same block, leading to invalid blocks and varying
gas consumptions. In this paper, we quantify and characterize protocol
violations, execution errors and deviations in gas consumption of blocks and
transactions to examine technical deployability. For that, we permute and
execute the transactions of over 335,000 Ethereum Mainnet blocks multiple
times. About 22% of block permutations are invalid due to protocol violations
caused by privately mined transactions or blocks close to their gas limit.
Also, almost all transactions which show execution errors under permutation but
not in the original order are privately mined transactions. Only 6% of
transactions show deviations in gas consumption and 98% of block permutations
deviate at most 10% from their original gas consumption. From a technical
perspective, these results suggest that randomized transaction ordering may be
feasible if transaction selection is handled carefully.

Title: Enhancing Split Learning with Sharded and Blockchain-Enabled SplitFed
  Approaches

Comments: Accepted by the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain
  (Blockchain)
\\
  Collaborative and distributed learning techniques, such as Federated Learning
(FL) and Split Learning (SL), hold significant promise for leveraging sensitive
data in privacy-critical domains. However, FL and SL suffer from key
limitations -- FL imposes substantial computational demands on clients, while
SL leads to prolonged training times. To overcome these challenges, SplitFed
Learning (SFL) was introduced as a hybrid approach that combines the strengths
of FL and SL. Despite its advantages, SFL inherits scalability, performance,
and security issues from SL. In this paper, we propose two novel frameworks:
Sharded SplitFed Learning (SSFL) and Blockchain-enabled SplitFed Learning
(BSFL). SSFL addresses the scalability and performance constraints of SFL by
distributing the workload and communication overhead of the SL server across
multiple parallel shards. Building upon SSFL, BSFL replaces the centralized
server with a blockchain-based architecture that employs a committee-driven
consensus mechanism to enhance fairness and security. BSFL incorporates an
evaluation mechanism to exclude poisoned or tampered model updates, thereby
mitigating data poisoning and model integrity attacks. Experimental evaluations
against baseline SL and SFL approaches show that SSFL improves performance and
scalability by 31.2% and 85.2%, respectively. Furthermore, BSFL increases
resilience to data poisoning attacks by 62.7% while maintaining superior
performance under normal operating conditions. To the best of our knowledge,
BSFL is the first blockchain-enabled framework to implement an end-to-end
decentralized SplitFed Learning system.

  Portability, performance, and productivity are three critical dimensions for
evaluating a programming model or compiler infrastructure. Several modern
programming models for computational science focus on performance and
portability. On the other end, several machine learning focused programming
models focus on portability and productivity. A clear solution that is strong
in all three dimensions has yet to emerge. A second related problem arises when
use cases from computational science converge with machine learning. The
disparate popular frameworks of these fields require programmers to manually
integrate codes written in different frameworks. Finally, several programming
frameworks lack easy options for extensibility as any new computer architecture
change require complex changes to the programming models. We present LAPIS, an
MLIR-based compiler that addresses all three of these challenges. We
demonstrate that LAPIS can automatically lower sparse and dense linear algebra
kernels from computational science and artificial intelligence use cases. We
also show how LAPIS facilitates the integration of codes between PyTorch and
Kokkos. We compare kernel performance with the default MLIR implementations on
diverse architectures to demonstrate portability. By developing a dialect that
is built on the principles of the Kokkos ecosystem, LAPIS also allows
extensibility of the framework to new architectures.

a novel framework for edge-assisted UAV networks with spatio-temporal dynamism.
PAST integrates two complementary mechanisms: PilotAO (pilot trading agreements
with overbooking), a risk-aware, overbooking-enabled early-stage
decision-making module that establishes long-term, mutually beneficial
agreements and boosts resource utilization; and AdaptAO (adaptive trading
agreements with overbooking rate update), an intelligent adaptation module that
dynamically updates agreements and overbooking rates based on UAV mobility,
supply-demand variations, and agreement performance. Together, these mechanisms
enable both stability and flexibility, guaranteeing individual rationality,
strong stability, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that PAST consistently
outperforms benchmark methods in decision-making overhead, task completion
latency, resource utilization, and social welfare. By combining predictive
planning with real-time adjustments, PAST offers a valuable reference on robust
and adaptive practice for improving low-altitude mission performance.

Title: Accelerating LLM Inference with Precomputed Query Storage
Authors: Jay H. Park, Youngju Cho, Choungsol Lee, Moonwook Oh, Euiseong Seo
Categories: cs.DC cs.AI
\\
  Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high latency,
particularly in resource-constrained environments such as on-device or edge
deployments. To address this challenge, we present StorInfer, a novel
storage-assisted LLM inference system that accelerates response time by
precomputing and storing predictable query-response pairs offline. When a user
query semantically matches a precomputed query, StorInfer bypasses expensive
GPU inference and instantly returns the stored response, significantly reducing
latency and compute costs. To maximize coverage and effectiveness, StorInfer
employs an LLM-driven generator that adaptively produces diverse and
deduplicated queries based on a given knowledge base. This is achieved via two
techniques: adaptive query masking, which prevents regeneration of similar
queries, and adaptive sampling, which dynamically tunes generation parameters
to promote semantic diversity. The resulting query-response pairs are embedded
and indexed using a disk-backed vector database to enable fast,
similarity-based retrieval at runtime. Using this approach, we generated 150K
unique precomputed pairs (taking up to 830 MB of storage space), achieving up
to 17.3% latency reduction with no loss in response quality. Our evaluation
across multiple QA datasets demonstrates the practicality and scalability of
storage-assisted inference, especially in scenarios with predictable query
distributions. StorInfer highlights a promising direction in leveraging storage
as a primary enabler for efficient, low-latency LLM deployment.

\\
  Network Interface Cards (NICs) greatly evolved from simple basic devices
moving traffic in and out of the network to complex heterogeneous systems
offloading host CPUs from performing complex tasks on in-transit packets. These
latter comprise different types of devices, ranging from NICs accelerating
fixed specific functions (e.g., on-the-fly data compression/decompression,
checksum computation, data encryption, etc.) to complex Systems-on-Chip (SoC)
equipped with both general purpose processors and specialized engines
(Smart-NICs). Similarly, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) moved from pure
reprogrammable devices to modern heterogeneous systems comprising
general-purpose processors, real-time cores and even AI-oriented engines.
Furthermore, the availability of high-speed network interfaces (e.g., SFPs)
makes modern FPGAs a good choice for implementing Smart-NICs. In this work, we
extended the functionalities offered by an open-source NIC implementation
(Corundum) by enabling time-aware traffic management in hardware, and using
this feature to control the bandwidth associated with different traffic
classes. By exposing dedicated control registers on the AXI bus, the driver of
the NIC can easily configure the transmission bandwidth of different
prioritized queues. Basically, each control register is associated with a
specific transmission queue (Corundum can expose up to thousands of
transmission and receiving queues), and sets up the fraction of time in a
transmission window which the queue is supposed to get access the output port
and transmit the packets. Queues are then prioritized and associated to
different traffic classes through the Linux QDISC mechanism. Experimental
evaluation demonstrates that the approach allows to properly manage the
bandwidth reserved to the different transmission flows.

Title: Efficient Distributed Training via Dual Batch Sizes and Cyclic
  Progressive Learning
Authors: Kuan-Wei Lu, Ding-Yong Hong, Pangfeng Liu, Jan-Jan Wu
Categories: cs.DC cs.LG
\\
  Distributed machine learning is critical for training deep learning models on
large datasets and with numerous parameters. Current research primarily focuses
on leveraging additional hardware resources and powerful computing units to
accelerate the training process. As a result, larger batch sizes are often
employed to speed up training. However, training with large batch sizes can
lead to lower accuracy due to poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose the dual batch size learning scheme, a distributed training method
built on the parameter server framework. This approach maximizes training
efficiency by utilizing the largest batch size that the hardware can support
while incorporating a smaller batch size to enhance model generalization. By
using two different batch sizes simultaneously, this method reduces testing
loss and enhances generalization, with minimal extra training time.
Additionally, to mitigate the time overhead caused by dual batch size learning,
we propose the cyclic progressive learning scheme. This technique gradually
adjusts image resolution from low to high during training, significantly
boosting training speed. By combining cyclic progressive learning with dual
batch size learning, our hybrid approach improves both model generalization and
training efficiency. Experimental results using ResNet-18 show that, compared
to conventional training methods, our method can improve accuracy by 3.3% while
reducing training time by 10.6% on CIFAR-100, and improve accuracy by 0.1%
while reducing training time by 35.7% on ImageNet.

  This paper presents the Accurate Google Cloud Simulator (AGOCS) - a novel
high-fidelity Cloud workload simulator based on parsing real workload traces,
which can be conveniently used on a desktop machine for day-to-day research.
Our simulation is based on real-world workload traces from a Google Cluster
with 12.5K nodes, over a period of a calendar month. The framework is able to
reveal very precise and detailed parameters of the executed jobs, tasks and
nodes as well as to provide actual resource usage statistics. The system has
been implemented in Scala language with focus on parallel execution and an
easy-to-extend design concept. The paper presents the detailed structural
framework for AGOCS and discusses our main design decisions, whilst also
suggesting alternative and possibly performance enhancing future approaches.

Title: Parallax: Efficient LLM Inference Service over Decentralized Environment
Authors: Chris Tong, Youhe Jiang, Gufeng Chen, Tianyi Zhao, Sibian Lu, Wenjie
  Qu, Eric Yang, Lynn Ai, Binhang Yuan
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Deploying a large language model (LLM) inference service remains costly
because centralized serving depends on specialized GPU clusters and
high-bandwidth interconnects in datacenters. An appealing alternative is to
leverage collaborative decentralized GPU pools. However, heterogeneity in GPU
and limited interconnected network bandwidth, along with potentially dynamic
availability, make efficient scheduling the central challenge in this scenario.
In this paper, we present Parallax, a decentralized LLM serving system that
turns a pool of heterogeneous GPUs into an efficient inference platform via a
two-phase scheduler. Parallax decomposes planning into (i) model allocation,
which places layers of each replica across diverse GPUs to jointly optimize
latency and throughput under memory and link-bandwidth constraints, and (ii)
request-time GPU pipeline selection, which stitches layers from different
replicas into end-to-end execution chains that balance load and adapt to
current conditions. We implement Parallax and evaluate it on open-source LLMs
deployed over real volunteer nodes. Parallax consistently reduces latency and
increases throughput relative to decentralized baselines, demonstrating that
principled scheduling can make volunteer compute a practical, affordable
substrate for LLM inference.

Title: I Like To Move It - Computation Instead of Data in the Brain
Authors: Fabian Czappa, Marvin Kaster, Felix Wolf
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  The detailed functioning of the human brain is still poorly understood. Brain
simulations are a well-established way to complement experimental research, but
must contend with the computational demands of the approximately $10^{11}$
neurons and the $10^{14}$ synapses connecting them, the network of the latter
referred to as the connectome. Studies suggest that changes in the connectome
(i.e., the formation and deletion of synapses, also known as structural
plasticity) are essential for critical tasks such as memory formation and
learning. The connectivity update can be efficiently computed using a
Barnes-Hut-inspired approximation that lowers the computational complexity from
$O(n^2)$ to $O(n log n)$, where n is the number of neurons. However, updating
synapses, which relies heavily on RMA, and the spike exchange between neurons,
which requires all-to-all communication at every time step, still hinder
scalability. We present a new algorithm that significantly reduces the
communication overhead by moving computation instead of data. This shrinks the
time it takes to update connectivity by a factor of six and the time it takes
to exchange spikes by more than two orders of magnitude.

Title: Efficient Construction of Large Search Spaces for Auto-Tuning
Authors: Floris-Jan Willemsen, Rob V. van Nieuwpoort, Ben van Werkhoven
Categories: cs.DC cs.PF
ACM-class: C.4; I.m; I.2.8
DOI: 10.1145/3754598.3754601
\\
  Automatic performance tuning, or auto-tuning, accelerates high-performance
codes by exploring vast spaces of code variants. However, due to the large
number of possible combinations and complex constraints, constructing these
search spaces can be a major bottleneck. Real-world applications have been
encountered where the search space construction takes minutes to hours or even
days. Current state-of-the-art techniques for search space construction, such
as chain-of-trees, lack a formal foundation and only perform adequately on a
specific subset of search spaces.
  We show that search space construction for constraint-based auto-tuning can
be reformulated as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Building on this
insight with a CSP solver, we develop a runtime parser that translates
user-defined constraint functions into solver-optimal expressions, optimize the
solver to exploit common structures in auto-tuning constraints, and integrate
these and other advances in open-source tools. These contributions
substantially improve performance and accessibility while preserving
flexibility.
  We evaluate our approach using a diverse set of benchmarks, demonstrating
that our optimized solver reduces construction time by four orders of magnitude
versus brute-force enumeration, three orders of magnitude versus an unoptimized
CSP solver, and one to two orders of magnitude versus leading auto-tuning
frameworks built on chain-of-trees. We thus eliminate a critical scalability
barrier for auto-tuning and provide a drop-in solution that enables the
exploration of previously unattainable problem scales in auto-tuning and
related domains.

Title: CSnake: Detecting Self-Sustaining Cascading Failure via Causal Stitching
  of Fault Propagations
Authors: Shangshu Qian, Lin Tan, Yongle Zhang
Categories: cs.DC cs.SE
Comments: Accepted by EuroSys 2026
\\
  Recent studies have revealed that self-sustaining cascading failures in
distributed systems frequently lead to widespread outages, which are
challenging to contain and recover from. Existing failure detection techniques
struggle to expose such failures prior to deployment, as they typically require
a complex combination of specific conditions to be triggered. This challenge
stems from the inherent nature of cascading failures, as they typically involve
a sequence of fault propagations, each activated by distinct conditions.
  This paper presents CSnake, a fault injection framework to expose
self-sustaining cascading failures in distributed systems. CSnake uses the
novel idea of causal stitching, which causally links multiple single-fault
injections in different tests to simulate complex fault propagation chains. To
identify these chains, CSnake designs a counterfactual causality analysis of
fault propagations - fault causality analysis (FCA): FCA compares the execution
trace of a fault injection run with its corresponding profile run (i.e., same
test w/o the injection) and identifies any additional faults triggered, which
are considered to have a causal relationship with the injected fault.
  To address the large search space of fault and workload combinations, CSnake
employs a three-phase allocation protocol of test budget that prioritizes
faults with unique and diverse causal consequences, increasing the likelihood
of uncovering conditional fault propagations. Furthermore, to avoid incorrectly
connecting fault propagations from workloads with incompatible conditions,
CSnake performs a local compatibility check that approximately checks the
compatibility of the path constraints associated with connected fault
propagations with low overhead.
  CSnake detected 15 bugs that cause self-sustaining cascading failures in five
systems, five of which have been confirmed with two fixed.

Title: An Agent-Based Simulation of Ageing Societies: Accessibility and Care
  Dynamics in Remote Areas

\\
  This paper presents an agent-based simulation of accessibility and care
dynamics in ageing societies, applied to the Italian inner area of Premeno
(VB). The model integrates census and municipal data, drone-derived elevation
models, GIS road networks, and survey-based caregiving information to generate
synthetic populations of older adults and their caregivers. Agents are
organized into dyads with socio-economic and mobility attributes, enabling the
simulation of both micro-scale accessibility and meso-scale caregiving
outcomes. Two scenarios are compared: a baseline and an alternative involving
the relocation of healthcare services. Key indicators include caregiver effort,
overwhelmed caregivers, walkability, and unmet hours of care. Findings show
that while relocation improves walkability locally, it increases unmet care
hours due to detours and reduced proximity. Household income emerges as the
primary driver of caregiver burden, with accessibility shaped by interactions
between financial and mobility resources. Results highlight the need for
interventions tailored to context-specific constraints in remote ageing
communities.

Title: FMIP: Joint Continuous-Integer Flow For Mixed-Integer Linear Programming

  Wang, Yinyu Ye
Categories: math.OC cs.AI
Comments: FMIP is a generative framework that jointly models integer and
  continuous variables in MILP, achieving a 41.34% reduction in primal gap and
  demonstrating compatibility with various solvers and applications
\\
  Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a foundational tool for complex
decision-making problems. However, the NP-hard nature of MILP presents a
significant computational challenge, motivating the development of machine
learning-based heuristic solutions to accelerate downstream solvers. While
recent generative models have shown promise in learning powerful heuristics,
they suffer from a critical limitation. That is, they model the distribution of
only the integer variables and fail to capture the intricate coupling between
integer and continuous variables, creating an information bottleneck and
ultimately leading to suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose Joint
Continuous-Integer Flow for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (FMIP), which is
the first generative framework that models the joint distribution of both
integer and continuous variables for MILP solutions. Built upon the joint
modeling paradigm, a holistic guidance mechanism is designed to steer the
generative trajectory, actively refining solutions toward optimality and
feasibility during the inference process. Extensive experiments on eight
standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of FMIP against
existing baselines, reducing the primal gap by 41.34% on average. Moreover, we
show that FMIP is fully compatible with arbitrary backbone networks and various
downstream solvers, making it well-suited for a broad range of real-world MILP
applications.

  Large language model (LLM) applications often reuse previously processed
context, such as chat history and documents, which introduces significant
redundant computation. Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant
computation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the
corresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these
LLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large
and requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.
  However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high
loading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To
increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression
as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the
compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache
entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly
degrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines
across three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at
the same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay.

Title: APRIL: API Synthesis with Automatic Prompt Optimization and
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Hua Zhong, Shan Jiang, Sarfraz Khurshid
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.LG cs.PL
\\
  APIs are central to modern software development, yet composing new APIs from
large libraries is difficult due to the exponential search space; traditional
component-based synthesis relies on costly exploration and hand-crafted
specifications. While large language models (LLMs) can generate implementations
from natural language, hallucinations and limited access to up-to-date
contextual information often yield incorrect code. In this paper, we present
APRIL, an approach that combines LLM-based synthesis with Automatic Prompt
Optimization (APO) and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR):
APO iteratively refines prompts for a frozen model, while RLVR fine-tunes the
policy toward functional correctness, producing an efficient synthesis
pipeline. Evaluated on 81 real-world APIs from widely used scientific Python
libraries and benchmarked against instruction-tuned but unfine-tuned LLMs
guided by expert prompts, APRIL achieves substantial improvements. These
results indicate that integrating APO and RLVR provides a robust, scalable path
for component-based API synthesis in large libraries.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest great promises in

four diverse and complex open-source Verus projects.
  We further introduce RagVerus, an extensible framework that synergizes
retrieval-augmented generation with context-aware prompting to automate proof

existing benchmarks under constrained model inference budgets, and achieves a
27% relative improvement on the more challenging RVBench benchmark,
demonstrating a scalable and sample-efficient verification solution.

  Code editing plays a vital role in software engineering, requiring developers
to adjust existing code according to natural language instructions while
keeping functionality intact and avoiding unnecessary modifications. However,
commit-based datasets commonly used for this task are often noisy, lack
diversity, and fail to reflect the style of real-world edit instructions. To
address this, we introduce CanItEdit, an open-source pipeline that leverages
multiple LLMs to synthesize realistic code-edit triplets. The pipeline produces
both concise "lazy" instructions and more detailed "descriptive" ones, and
applies filtering based on diffs and topics to guarantee data quality and
variety. Using this process, we construct OCEDataFT, a curated dataset of 20K
samples. Fine-tuning three advanced base models on OCEDataFT leads to
significant performance boosts on the CanItEdit benchmark, with relative pass@1
improvements ranging from 4.50% to 20.79%. Notably, the resulting models
achieve performance close to closed-source systems, narrowing the gap to GPT-4
to just 3.54%, without relying on proprietary resources or manual annotation.

Comments: Submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026
\\
  Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

factors: key variables, relationships, and decision boundary values for
predicting target classes. We demonstrate that the robustness of LLMs varies
significantly over different datasets, and that high-quality LLM-generated
features can improve few-shot prediction performance by up to 10.52%. This work

Title: STCast: Adaptive Boundary Alignment for Global and Regional Weather
  Forecasting
Authors: Hao Chen, Tao Han, Jie Zhang, Song Guo, Lei Bai
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI physics.ao-ph
\\
  To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

Title: Six Sigma For Neural Networks: Taguchi-based optimization
Authors: Sai Varun Kodathala
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV
Comments: 23 Pages, 9 Tables
\\
  The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

Title: On-the-Fly Adaptation to Quantization: Configuration-Aware LoRA for
  Efficient Fine-Tuning of Quantized LLMs
Authors: Rongguang Ye, Ming Tang, Edith C. H. Ngai
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

Title: Learning to Condition: A Neural Heuristic for Scalable MPE Inference
Authors: Brij Malhotra, Shivvrat Arya, Tahrima Rahman, Vibhav Giridhar Gogate
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Will appear in NeurIPS 2025
\\
  We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Enhancing Linear Attention with Residual Learning
Authors: Xunhao Lai, Jialiang Kang, Jianqiao Lu, Tong Lin, Pengyu Zhao
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 15 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

  A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy
distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying
data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of

  Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

  Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

  "Quantum est in libris" explores the intersection of the archaic and the
modern. On one side, there are manuscript materials from the Estonian National
Museum's (ERM) more than century-old archive describing the life experiences of
Estonian people; on the other side, there is technology that transforms these
materials into a dynamic and interactive experience. Connecting technology and
cultural heritage is the visitor, who turns texts into inputs for a screen
sculpture.
  Historical narratives are visually brought to life through the contemporary
technological language. Because the video AI models we employed, Runway Gen-3
and Gen-4, have not previously interacted with Estonian heritage, we can
observe how machines today "read the world" and create future heritage.
"Quantum est in libris" introduces an exciting yet unsettling new dimension to
the concept of cultural heritage: in a world where data are fluid and
interpretations unstable, heritage status becomes fragile. In the digital
environment, heritage issues are no longer just about preservation and
transmission, but also about representation of the media, machine creativity,
and interpretive error. Who or what shapes memory processes and memory spaces,
and how?

  Cases

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

  Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

  Accurate project localization (e.g., files and functions) for issue
resolution is a critical first step in software maintenance. However, existing
benchmarks for issue localization, such as SWE-Bench and LocBench, are limited.
They focus predominantly on pull-request issues and code locations, ignoring
other evidence and non-code files such as commits, comments, configurations,
and documentation. To address this gap, we introduce MULocBench, a
comprehensive dataset of 1,100 issues from 46 popular GitHub Python projects.
Comparing with existing benchmarks, MULocBench offers greater diversity in
issue types, root causes, location scopes, and file types, providing a more
realistic testbed for evaluation. Using this benchmark, we assess the
performance of state-of-the-art localization methods and five LLM-based
prompting strategies. Our results reveal significant limitations in current
techniques: even at the file level, performance metrics (Acc@5, F1) remain
below 40%. This underscores the challenge of generalizing to realistic,
multi-faceted issue resolution. To enable future research on project
localization for issue resolution, we publicly release MULocBench at

Categories: cs.SE cs.AI

  LLMs demonstrate surface-level fluency in code generation but struggle with
structured reasoning tasks requiring correctness and semantic alignment. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning through intermediate steps,
it suffers from verbosity and inefficiency. Chain-of-Draft (CoD) prompting
offers more concise reasoning, but the stochastic nature of LLMs produces
varying solution quality, making optimal selection challenging. We propose
\multicod, a reinforcement learning framework that learns to select the most
promising candidate from CoD-generated solutions. Our approach uses
strategy-guided prompting to encourage diverse reasoning styles and models
solution selection as a contextual bandit problem. The framework optimizes
interpretable features including code complexity, reasoning structure, and
strategic metadata through a reward function balancing correctness, efficiency,
and clarity. Experiments on MBPP, BigCodeBench, SWE-bench Verified, and
Defects4J show \multicod~outperforms and in some cases, on par with standard
prompting, CoT, and CoD baselines while achieving cost and token efficiency
from the user's perspective through a multi-candidate design that charges only
for the selected output, reducing user billing by over 50\% and improving LLM
response quality, making \multicod~more sustainable and scalable for real-world
deployment. Our code is available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MultiCoD.

three distinct quantum encoding techniques and comprehensive architectural
variations. Through empirical evaluation across multiple entanglement patterns,
circuit depths, and optimization strategies,quantum advantages in fraud
classification accuracy are demonstrated, achieving up to 94.3 % accuracy with

across entanglement topologies, with circular entanglement consistently
outperforming linear (90.7) %) and full connectivity (92.0 %) patterns,
achieving optimal performance at 93.3 % accuracy. The study introduces novel
visualization methodologies for quantum circuit analysis and provides
actionable deployment recommendations for practical quantum machine learning

circular connectivity provides superior balance between expressivity and
trainability while maintaining computational efficiency. These researches offer
initial benchmarks for quantum enhanced fraud detection systems and propose
potential benefits of quantum machine learning in financial security

  Since the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have been widely
adopted for various tasks such as text summarization, question answering,
speech-to-text translation, and more. In recent times, the use of LLMs for code
generation has gained significant attention, with tools such as Cursor and
Windsurf demonstrating the ability to analyze massive code repositories and
recommend relevant changes. Big tech companies have also acknowledged the
growing reliance on LLMs for code generation within their codebases. Although
these advances significantly improve developer productivity, increasing
reliance on automated code generation can proportionally increase the risk of
suboptimal solutions and insecure code. Our work focuses on automatically
sampling In-Context Learning (ICL) demonstrations which can improve model
performance and enhance the interpretability of the generated code. Using
AST-based analysis on outputs from the MBPP test set, we identify regions of
code most influenced by the chosen demonstrations. In our experiments, we show
that high-quality ICL demonstrations not only make outputs easier to interpret
but also yield a positive performance improvement on the pass@10 metric.
Conversely, poorly chosen ICL demonstrations affected the LLM performance on
the pass@10 metric negatively compared to the base model. Overall, our approach
highlights the importance of efficient sampling strategies for ICL, which can
affect the performance of the model on any given task.

  Automatically compiling open-source software (OSS) projects is a vital,
labor-intensive, and complex task, which makes it a good challenge for LLM
Agents. Existing methods rely on manually curated rules and workflows, which
cannot adapt to OSS that requires customized configuration or environment
setup. Recent attempts using Large Language Models (LLMs) used selective
evaluation on a subset of highly rated OSS, a practice that underestimates the
realistic challenges of OSS compilation. In practice, compilation instructions
are often absent, dependencies are undocumented, and successful builds may even
require patching source files or modifying build scripts. We propose a more
challenging and realistic benchmark, BUILD-BENCH, comprising OSS that are more
diverse in quality, scale, and characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a
strong baseline LLM-based agent, OSS-BUILD-AGENT, an effective system with
enhanced build instruction retrieval module that achieves state-of-the-art
performance on BUILD-BENCH and is adaptable to heterogeneous OSS
characteristics. We also provide detailed analysis regarding different
compilation method design choices and their influence to the whole task,
offering insights to guide future advances. We believe performance on
BUILD-BENCH can faithfully reflect an agent's ability to tackle compilation as
a complex software engineering tasks, and, as such, our benchmark will spur
innovation with a significant impact on downstream applications in the fields
of software development and software security.

  This paper introduces BEV-VLM, a novel framework for trajectory planning in
autonomous driving that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Bird's-Eye
View (BEV) feature maps as visual inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that
rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes
highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by
fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with
HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and
rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning.
Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in
planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that
VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV
features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory
planning.

Title: Knowledge distillation through geometry-aware representational alignment
Authors: Prajjwal Bhattarai, Mohammad Amjad, Dmytro Zhylko, Tuka Alhanai
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

fragmented, tests lack standardisation, and feedback loops between developers
and regulators are weak. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Sandbox
Configurator, a modular open-source framework that enables users to select
domain-relevant tests from a shared library and generate customised sandbox
environments with integrated dashboards. Its plug-in architecture aims to
support both open and proprietary modules, fostering a shared ecosystem of
interoperable AI assessment services. The framework aims to address multiple
stakeholders: CAs gain structured workflows for applying legal obligations;
technical experts can integrate robust evaluation methods; and AI providers
access a transparent pathway to compliance. By promoting cross-border
collaboration and standardisation, the Sandbox Configurator's goal is to
support a scalable and innovation-friendly European infrastructure for
trustworthy AI governance.

Title: Artificial Intelligence-Powered Assessment Framework for Skill-Oriented
  Engineering Lab Education
Authors: Vaishnavi Sharma, Rakesh Thakur, Shashwat Sharma, Kritika Panjanani
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  Practical lab education in computer science often faces challenges such as
plagiarism, lack of proper lab records, unstructured lab conduction, inadequate
execution and assessment, limited practical learning, low student engagement,
and absence of progress tracking for both students and faculties, resulting in
graduates with insufficient hands-on skills. In this paper, we introduce
AsseslyAI, which addresses these challenges through online lab allocation, a
unique lab problem for each student, AI-proctored viva evaluations, and
gamified simulators to enhance engagement and conceptual mastery. While
existing platforms generate questions based on topics, our framework fine-tunes
on a 10k+ question-answer dataset built from AI/ML lab questions to dynamically
generate diverse, code-rich assessments. Validation metrics show high
question-answer similarity, ensuring accurate answers and non-repetitive
questions. By unifying dataset-driven question generation, adaptive difficulty,
plagiarism resistance, and evaluation in a single pipeline, our framework
advances beyond traditional automated grading tools and offers a scalable path
to produce genuinely skilled graduates.

Title: How Effective Are Time-Series Models for Rainfall Nowcasting? A
  Comprehensive Benchmark for Rainfall Nowcasting Incorporating PWV Data
Authors: Yifang Zhang, Pengfei Duan, Henan Wang, Shengwu Xiong
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI physics.ao-ph stat.ML

\\
  Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

Title: From NL2SQL to NL2GeoSQL: GeoSQL-Eval for automated evaluation of LLMs
  on PostGIS queries
Authors: Shuyang Hou, Haoyue Jiao, Ziqi Liu, Lutong Xie, Guanyu Chen, Shaowen
  Wu, Xuefeng Guan, Huayi Wu
Categories: cs.DB cs.AI cs.LG cs.SE
\\
  In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in natural language understanding and structured query generation
(NL2SQL). However, extending these advances to GeoSQL tasks in the PostGIS
environment remains challenging due to the complexity of spatial functions,
geometric data types, and execution semantics. Existing evaluations primarily
focus on general relational databases or Google Earth Engine code generation,
leaving a lack of systematic benchmarks tailored to spatial databases. To
address this gap, this study introduces GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end
automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation. Built upon Webb's
Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, the framework encompasses four cognitive
dimensions, five proficiency levels, and twenty task categories, providing a
comprehensive assessment of model performance in terms of knowledge
acquisition, syntactic generation, semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and
robustness. In parallel, we developed GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark dataset
comprising 14178 questions that span three task types, 340 PostGIS functions,
and 82 domain-specific databases. Leveraging this framework, we systematically
evaluated 24 representative models across six categories, applying
entropy-weighting and statistical analyses to reveal differences in
performance, error distributions, and resource consumption patterns.
Furthermore, we established a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard that enables
global research teams to conduct ongoing testing and comparison. These
contributions not only extend the boundaries of NL2SQL applications but also
provide a standardized, interpretable, and scalable framework for evaluating
LLM performance in spatial database contexts, offering valuable insights for
model optimization and applications in geographic information science, urban
studies, and spatial analysis.

  in Dubrovnik (September 2025): AI and Digital Transformation in Higher
  Education
\\
  Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping educational practice,
challenging long held assumptions about teaching and learning. This article
integrates conceptual perspectives from recent books (Genesis by Eric Schmidt,
Henry Kissinger and Craig Mundie, CoIntelligence by Ethan Mollick, and The
Inevitable by Kevin Kelly) with empirical insights from popular AI podcasts and
Anthropic public releases. We examine seven key domains: emotional support,
creativity, contextual understanding, student engagement, problem solving,
ethics and morality, and collaboration. For each domain, we explore AI
capabilities, opportunities for transformative change, and emerging best
practices, drawing equally from theoretical analysis and real world
observations. Overall, we find that AI, when used thoughtfully, can complement
and enhance human educators in fostering richer learning experiences across
cognitive, social, and emotional dimensions. We emphasize an optimistic yet
responsible outlook: educators and students should actively shape AI
integration to amplify human potential in creativity, ethical reasoning,
collaboration, and beyond, while maintaining a focus on human centric values.

Title: Dynamic Policy Induction for Adaptive Prompt Optimization: Bridging the
  Efficiency-Accuracy Gap via Lightweight Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Jiexi Xu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables
ACM-class: I.2.6; I.2.7; I.2.8
\\
  The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

  Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

Title: InfMasking: Unleashing Synergistic Information by Contrastive Multimodal
  Interactions
Authors: Liangjian Wen, Qun Dai, Jianzhuang Liu, Jiangtao Zheng, Yong Dai,
  Dongkai Wang, Zhao Kang, Jun Wang, Zenglin Xu, Jiang Duan
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

Title: DNABERT-2: Fine-Tuning a Genomic Language Model for Colorectal Gene
  Enhancer Classification
Authors: Darren King, Yaser Atlasi and Gholamreza Rafiee
Categories: q-bio.GN cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 10 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Gene enhancers control when and where genes switch on, yet their sequence
diversity and tissue specificity make them hard to pinpoint in colorectal
cancer. We take a sequence-only route and fine-tune DNABERT-2, a transformer
genomic language model that uses byte-pair encoding to learn variable-length
tokens from DNA. Using assays curated via the Johnston Cancer Research Centre
at Queen's University Belfast, we assembled a balanced corpus of 2.34 million 1
kb enhancer sequences, applied summit-centered extraction and rigorous
de-duplication including reverse-complement collapse, and split the data
stratified by class. With a 4096-term vocabulary and a 232-token context chosen
empirically, the DNABERT-2-117M classifier was trained with Optuna-tuned
hyperparameters and evaluated on 350742 held-out sequences. The model reached
PR-AUC 0.759, ROC-AUC 0.743, and best F1 0.704 at an optimized threshold
(0.359), with recall 0.835 and precision 0.609. Against a CNN-based EnhancerNet
trained on the same data, DNABERT-2 delivered stronger threshold-independent
ranking and higher recall, although point accuracy was lower. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to apply a second-generation genomic language model
with BPE tokenization to enhancer classification in colorectal cancer,
demonstrating the feasibility of capturing tumor-associated regulatory signals
directly from DNA sequence alone. Overall, our results show that
transformer-based genomic models can move beyond motif-level encodings toward
holistic classification of regulatory elements, offering a novel path for
cancer genomics. Next steps will focus on improving precision, exploring hybrid
CNN-transformer designs, and validating across independent datasets to
strengthen real-world utility.

Title: VoiceBridge: Designing Latent Bridge Models for General Speech
  Restoration at Scale
Authors: Chi Zhang, Zehua Chen, Kaiwen Zheng, Jun Zhu
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI eess.AS
\\
  Bridge models have recently been explored for speech enhancement tasks such
as denoising, dereverberation, and super-resolution, while these efforts are
typically confined to a single task or small-scale datasets, with constrained
general speech restoration (GSR) capability at scale. In this work, we
introduce VoiceBridge, a GSR system rooted in latent bridge models (LBMs),
capable of reconstructing high-fidelity speech at full-band (\textit{i.e.,}
48~kHz) from various distortions. By compressing speech waveform into
continuous latent representations, VoiceBridge models the~\textit{diverse
LQ-to-HQ tasks} (namely, low-quality to high-quality) in GSR with~\textit{a
single latent-to-latent generative process} backed by a scalable transformer
architecture. To better inherit the advantages of bridge models from the data
domain to the latent space, we present an energy-preserving variational
autoencoder, enhancing the alignment between the waveform and latent space over
varying energy levels. Furthermore, to address the difficulty of HQ
reconstruction from distinctively different LQ priors, we propose a joint
neural prior, uniformly alleviating the reconstruction burden of LBM. At last,
considering the key requirement of GSR systems, human perceptual quality, a
perceptually aware fine-tuning stage is designed to mitigate the cascading
mismatch in generation while improving perceptual alignment. Extensive
validation across in-domain and out-of-domain tasks and datasets
(\textit{e.g.}, refining recent zero-shot speech and podcast generation
results) demonstrates the superior performance of VoiceBridge. Demo samples can

Title: Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Simulating Regional
  Psychological Structures: An Empirical Examination of Personality and
  Subjective Well-being
Authors: Ke Luoma, Li Zengyi, Liao Jiangqun, Tong Song, Peng Kaiping
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.HC
\\
  This study examines whether LLMs can simulate culturally grounded
psychological patterns based on demographic information. Using DeepSeek, we
generated 2943 virtual participants matched to demographic distributions from
the CFPS2018 and compared them with human responses on the Big Five personality
traits and subjective well-being across seven Chinese regions.Personality was
measured using a 15-item Chinese Big Five inventory, and happiness with a
single-item rating. Results revealed broad similarity between real and
simulated datasets, particularly in regional variation trends. However,
systematic differences emerged:simulated participants scored lower in
extraversion and openness, higher in agreeableness and neuroticism, and
consistently reported lower happiness. Predictive structures also diverged:
while human data identified conscientiousness, extraversion and openness as
positive predictors of happiness, the AI emphasized openness and agreeableness,
with extraversion predicting negatively. These discrepancies suggest that while
LLMs can approximate population-level psychological distributions, they
underrepresent culturally specific and affective dimensions. The findings
highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM-based virtual participants
for large-scale psychological research and underscore the need for culturally
enriched training data and improved affective modeling.

  Experimental Analysis of Democratic and Autocratic Biases in Large-Language
  Models
Authors: Szymon {\L}ukasik and Natalia O\.zegalska-{\L}ukasik
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  Political beliefs vary significantly across different countries, reflecting
distinct historical, cultural, and institutional contexts. These ideologies,
ranging from liberal democracies to rigid autocracies, influence human
societies, as well as the digital systems that are constructed within those
societies. The advent of generative artificial intelligence, particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), introduces new agents in the political space-agents
trained on massive corpora that replicate and proliferate socio-political
assumptions. This paper analyses whether LLMs display propensities consistent
with democratic or autocratic world-views. We validate this insight through
experimental tests in which we experiment with the leading LLMs developed
across disparate political contexts, using several existing psychometric and
political orientation measures. The analysis is based on both numerical scoring
and qualitative analysis of the models' responses. Findings indicate high
model-to-model variability and a strong association with the political culture
of the country in which the model was developed. These findings highlight the
need for more detailed examination of the socio-political dimensions embedded
within AI systems.

  Algorithm Recommendation
Authors: Mohammadreza Bakhtyari, Bogdan Mazoure, Renato Cordeiro de Amorim,

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

  The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has been proposed as a unifying standard for
connecting large language models (LLMs) with external tools and resources,
promising the same role for AI integration that HTTP and USB played for the Web
and peripherals. Yet, despite rapid adoption and hype, its trajectory remains
uncertain. Are MCP marketplaces truly growing, or merely inflated by
placeholders and abandoned prototypes? Are servers secure and
privacy-preserving, or do they expose users to systemic risks? And do clients
converge on standardized protocols, or remain fragmented across competing
designs? In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of the
MCP ecosystem. We design and implement MCPCrawler, a systematic measurement
framework that collects and normalizes data from six major markets. Over a
14-day campaign, MCPCrawler aggregated 17,630 raw entries, of which 8,401 valid
projects (8,060 servers and 341 clients) were analyzed. Our results reveal that
more than half of listed projects are invalid or low-value, that servers face
structural risks including dependency monocultures and uneven maintenance, and
that clients exhibit a transitional phase in protocol and connection patterns.
Together, these findings provide the first evidence-based view of the MCP
ecosystem, its risks, and its future trajectory.

Title: AI in Pakistani Schools: Adoption, Usage, and Perceived Impact among
  Educators
Authors: Syed Hassan Raza, and Azib Farooq
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly permeating classrooms worldwide,
yet its adoption in schools of developing countries remains under-explored.
This paper investigates AI adoption, usage patterns, and perceived impact in
Pakistani K-12 schools based on a survey of 125 educators. The questionnaire
covered educator's familiarity with AI, frequency and modes of use, and
attitudes toward AI's benefits and challenges. Results reveal a generally
positive disposition towards AI: over two-thirds of teachers expressed
willingness to adopt AI tools given proper support and many have begun
integrating AI for lesson planning and content creation. However, AI usage is
uneven - while about one-third of respondents actively use AI tools frequently,
others remain occasional users. Content generation emerged as the most common
AI application, whereas AI-driven grading and feedback are rarely used.
Teachers reported moderate improvements in student engagement and efficiency
due to AI, but also voiced concerns about equitable access. These findings
highlight both the enthusiasm for AI's potential in Pakistan's schools and the
need for training and infrastructure to ensure inclusive and effective
implementation.

tuning of the desired musical relationship between a live musical input and a
real-time generated musical output, through the curation of a database of

module capable of learning and exploiting musical relationships from such

employing Transformers as the decision module, associated with a perception
module based on Wav2Vec 2.0, and concatenative synthesis as audio renderer. We
present a quantitative evaluation of the decision module's ability to reproduce
learned relationships extracted during training. We demonstrate that our
decision module can predict a coherent track B when conditioned by its
corresponding ''guide'' track A, based on a corpus of paired tracks (A, B).

  Developing full-stack web applications is complex and time-intensive,
demanding proficiency across diverse technologies and frameworks. Although
recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable automated
webpage generation from visual inputs, current solutions remain limited to
front-end tasks and fail to deliver fully functional applications. In this
work, we introduce TDDev, the first test-driven development (TDD)-enabled

a natural language description or design image, TDDev automatically derives
executable test cases, generates front-end and back-end code, simulates user
interactions, and iteratively refines the implementation until all requirements
are satisfied. Our framework addresses key challenges in full-stack automation,
including underspecified user requirements, complex interdependencies among
multiple files, and the need for both functional correctness and visual
fidelity. Through extensive experiments on diverse application scenarios, TDDev
achieves a 14.4% improvement on overall accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing reliable, high-quality
web applications without requiring manual intervention.

  While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

Title: Uncertainty-Aware Generative Oversampling Using an Entropy-Guided
  Conditional Variational Autoencoder

  Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

  We study active correlation clustering where pairwise similarities are not

learning. Specifically, we focus on the cold-start scenario, where no true
initial pairwise similarities are available for active learning. To address
this challenge, we propose a coverage-aware method that encourages diversity
early in the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through

Title: Let Physics Guide Your Protein Flows: Topology-aware Unfolding and
  Generation
Authors: Yogesh Verma, Markus Heinonen, and Vikas Garg
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

Title: Predicting Training Re-evaluation Curves Enables Effective Data
  Curriculums for LLMs
Authors: Shane Bergsma, Nolan Dey, Joel Hestness
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

Title: A Cartography of Open Collaboration in Open Source AI: Mapping
  Practices, Motivations, and Governance in 14 Open Large Language Model
  Projects
Authors: Johan Lin{\aa}ker, Cailean Osborne, Jennifer Ding, Ben Burtenshaw
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: In submission
\\
  The proliferation of open large language models (LLMs) is fostering a vibrant
ecosystem of research and innovation in artificial intelligence (AI). However,
the methods of collaboration used to develop open LLMs both before and after
their public release have not yet been comprehensively studied, limiting our
understanding of how open LLM projects are initiated, organized, and governed
as well as what opportunities there are to foster this ecosystem even further.
We address this gap through an exploratory analysis of open collaboration
throughout the development and reuse lifecycle of open LLMs, drawing on
semi-structured interviews with the developers of 14 open LLMs from grassroots
projects, research institutes, startups, and Big Tech companies in North
America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. We make three key contributions to research
and practice. First, collaboration in open LLM projects extends far beyond the
LLMs themselves, encompassing datasets, benchmarks, open source frameworks,
leaderboards, knowledge sharing and discussion forums, and compute
partnerships, among others. Second, open LLM developers have a variety of
social, economic, and technological motivations, from democratizing AI access
and promoting open science to building regional ecosystems and expanding
language representation. Third, the sampled open LLM projects exhibit five
distinct organizational models, ranging from single company projects to
non-profit-sponsored grassroots projects, which vary in their centralization of
control and community engagement strategies used throughout the open LLM
lifecycle. We conclude with practical recommendations for stakeholders seeking
to support the global community building a more open future for AI.

Title: FlashOmni: A Unified Sparse Attention Engine for Diffusion Transformers
Authors: Liang Qiao, Yue Dai, Yeqi Huang, Hongyu Kan, Jun Shi, Hong An
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.PF
\\
  Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

Title: Rethinking Parameter Sharing for LLM Fine-Tuning with Multiple LoRAs
Authors: Hao Ban, Kaiyi Ji
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are
available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/ALoRA.

Title: Polychromic Objectives for Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Jubayer Ibn Hamid, Ifdita Hasan Orney, Ellen Xu, Chelsea Finn, Dorsa
  Sadigh
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

Title: Beyond Noisy-TVs: Noise-Robust Exploration Via Learning Progress
  Monitoring
Authors: Zhibo Hou, Zhiyu An, Wan Du
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

\\
  Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

  This work develops a computational framework that combines physics-informed
neural networks with multi-patch isogeometric analysis to solve partial
differential equations on complex computer-aided design geometries. The method
utilizes patch-local neural networks that operate on the reference domain of
isogeometric analysis. A custom output layer enables the strong imposition of
Dirichlet boundary conditions. Solution conformity across interfaces between
non-uniform rational B-spline patches is enforced using dedicated interface
neural networks. Training is performed using the variational framework by
minimizing the energy functional derived after the weak form of the partial
differential equation. The effectiveness of the suggested method is
demonstrated on two highly non-trivial and practically relevant use-cases,
namely, a 2D magnetostatics model of a quadrupole magnet and a 3D nonlinear
solid and contact mechanics model of a mechanical holder. The results show
excellent agreement to reference solutions obtained with high-fidelity finite
element solvers, thus highlighting the potential of the suggested neural solver
to tackle complex engineering problems given the corresponding computer-aided
design models.

Comments: Under review
\\
  Environment setup-the process of configuring the system to work with a
specific software project-represents a persistent challenge in Software
Engineering (SE). Automated environment setup methods could assist developers
by providing fully configured environments for arbitrary repositories without
manual effort. This also helps SE researchers to scale execution-based
benchmarks. However, recent studies reveal that even state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) achieve limited success in automating this task. To
address this limitation, we tune a specialized model for environment setup. We
combine supervised fine-tuning for generating correct Bash scripts and
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to adapt it to the task
of environment setup. On EnvBench-Python, our method enables Qwen3-8B (a model
runnable on consumer hardware) to perform on par with larger models-Qwen3-32B
and GPT-4o. The training code and model checkpoints are available online:

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

Authors: Zhenfeng Deng, Ruijie Hou, Ningrui Xie, Mike Tyers, Micha{\l}

Categories: q-bio.BM cs.AI
Comments: Accepted by NeurIPS2025-AI4Science
\\
  Recent advances in structure-based protein design have accelerated de novo
binder generation, yet interfaces on large domains or spanning multiple domains
remain challenging due to high computational cost and declining success with
increasing target size. We hypothesized that protein folding neural networks
(PFNNs) operate in a ``local-first'' manner, prioritizing local interactions
while displaying limited sensitivity to global foldability.Guided by this
hypothesis, we propose an epitope-only strategy that retains only the
discontinuous surface residues surrounding the binding site. Compared to
intact-domain workflows, this approach improves in silico success rates by up
to 80% and reduces the average time per successful design by up to forty-fold,
enabling binder design against previously intractable targets such as ClpP and
ALS3. Building on this foundation, we further developed a tailored pipeline
that incorporates a Monte Carlo-based evolution step to overcome local minima
and a position-specific biased inverse folding step to refine sequence
patterns. Together, these advances not only establish a generalizable framework
for efficient binder design against structurally large and otherwise
inaccessible targets, but also support the broader ``local-first'' hypothesis
as a guiding principle for PFNN-based design.

Title: Translation from Wearable PPG to 12-Lead ECG
Authors: Hui Ji, Wei Gao, Pengfei Zhou
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 14 pages,10 figures
\\
  The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

Authors: Jiacheng Shi, Hongfei Du, Y. Alicia Hong, Ye Gao
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI

  Speech emotion recognition (SER) with audio-language models (ALMs) remains
vulnerable to distribution shifts at test time, leading to performance
degradation in out-of-domain scenarios. Test-time adaptation (TTA) provides a
promising solution but often relies on gradient-based updates or prompt tuning,
limiting flexibility and practicality. We propose Emo-TTA, a lightweight,
training-free adaptation framework that incrementally updates class-conditional
statistics via an Expectation-Maximization procedure for explicit test-time
distribution estimation, using ALM predictions as priors. Emo-TTA operates on
individual test samples without modifying model weights. Experiments on six
out-of-domain SER benchmarks show consistent accuracy improvements over prior
TTA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of statistical adaptation in
aligning model predictions with evolving test distributions.

  We are on the cusp where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality
(XR) are converging to unlock new paradigms of interactive computing. However,
a significant gap exists between the ecosystems of these two fields: while AI
research and development is accelerated by mature frameworks like JAX and
benchmarks like LMArena, prototyping novel AI-driven XR interactions remains a
high-friction process, often requiring practitioners to manually integrate
disparate, low-level systems for perception, rendering, and interaction. To
bridge this gap, we present XR Blocks, a cross-platform framework designed to
accelerate human-centered AI + XR innovation. XR Blocks strives to provide a
modular architecture with plug-and-play components for core abstraction in AI +
XR: user, world, peers; interface, context, and agents. Crucially, it is
designed with the mission of "reducing frictions from idea to reality", thus
accelerating rapid prototyping of AI + XR apps. Built upon accessible
technologies (WebXR, three.js, TensorFlow, Gemini), our toolkit lowers the
barrier to entry for XR creators. We demonstrate its utility through a set of
open-source templates, samples, and advanced demos, empowering the community to
quickly move from concept to interactive XR prototype. Site:

Title: Economic Competition, EU Regulation, and Executive Orders: A Framework
  for Discussing AI Policy Implications in CS Courses
Authors: James Weichert and Hoda Eldardiry
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  The growth and permeation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across
society has drawn focus to the ways in which the responsible use of these
technologies can be facilitated through AI governance. Increasingly, large
companies and governments alike have begun to articulate and, in some cases,
enforce governance preferences through AI policy. Yet existing literature
documents an unwieldy heterogeneity in ethical principles for AI governance,
while our own prior research finds that discussions of the implications of AI
policy are not yet present in the computer science (CS) curriculum. In this
context, overlapping jurisdictions and even contradictory policy preferences
across private companies, local, national, and multinational governments create
a complex landscape for AI policy which, we argue, will require AI developers
able adapt to an evolving regulatory environment. Preparing computing students
for the new challenges of an AI-dominated technology industry is therefore a
key priority for the CS curriculum.
  In this discussion paper, we seek to articulate a framework for integrating
discussions on the nascent AI policy landscape into computer science courses.
We begin by summarizing recent AI policy efforts in the United States and
European Union. Subsequently, we propose guiding questions to frame class
discussions around AI policy in technical and non-technical (e.g., ethics) CS
courses. Throughout, we emphasize the connection between normative policy
demands and still-open technical challenges relating to their implementation
and enforcement through code and governance structures. This paper therefore
represents a valuable contribution towards bridging research and discussions
across the areas of AI policy and CS education, underlining the need to prepare
AI engineers to interact with and adapt to societal policy preferences.

  Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

  The evolution of digital communication systems and the designs of online
platforms have inadvertently facilitated the subconscious propagation of toxic
behavior. Giving rise to reactive responses to toxic behavior. Toxicity in
online content and Artificial Intelligence Systems has become a serious
challenge to individual and collective well-being around the world. It is more
detrimental to society than we realize. Toxicity, expressed in language, image,
and video, can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of
usage. Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate
toxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large
Language Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of
toxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity
detection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has
focused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a
pattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to
generate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It
presents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the
context and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence
era. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on
toxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media
platforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual
mode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in
toxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language
Models, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation.

Title: Unsupervised Detection of Spatiotemporal Anomalies in PMU Data Using
  Transformer-Based BiGAN
Authors: Muhammad Imran Hossain, Jignesh Solanki, and Sarika Khushlani Solanki
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

Title: Quadratic Programming Approach for Nash Equilibrium Computation in
  Multiplayer Imperfect-Information Games
Authors: Sam Ganzfried
Categories: cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA
\\
  There has been significant recent progress in algorithms for approximation of
Nash equilibrium in large two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games and
exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games.
While counterfactual regret minimization and fictitious play are scalable to
large games and have convergence guarantees in two-player zero-sum games, they
do not guarantee convergence to Nash equilibrium in multiplayer games. We
present an approach for exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer
imperfect-information games that solves a quadratically-constrained program
based on a nonlinear complementarity problem formulation from the sequence-form
game representation. This approach capitalizes on recent advances for solving
nonconvex quadratic programs. Our algorithm is able to quickly solve
three-player Kuhn poker after removal of dominated actions. Of the available
algorithms in the Gambit software suite, only the logit quantal response
approach is successfully able to solve the game; however, the approach takes
longer than our algorithm and also involves a degree of approximation. Our
formulation also leads to a new approach for computing Nash equilibrium in
multiplayer strategic-form games which we demonstrate to outperform a previous
quadratically-constrained program formulation.

Title: STAC: When Innocent Tools Form Dangerous Chains to Jailbreak LLM Agents
Authors: Jing-Jing Li, Jianfeng He, Chao Shang, Devang Kulshreshtha, Xun Xian,

Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they
introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM
safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC),
a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains
together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined,
collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final
execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and
systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of
user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent
types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM
agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success
rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated
framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool
chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers
stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified
malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find
that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this
gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far
stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a
crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire
action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated
prompts or responses.

Title: BaB-prob: Branch and Bound with Preactivation Splitting for
  Probabilistic Verification of Neural Networks
Authors: Fangji Wang, Panagiotis Tsiotras
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

\\
  In this paper, we propose Capacity-Net, a novel unsupervised learning
approach aimed at maximizing the achievable rate in reflecting intelligent
surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) systems. To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we
optimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to
enhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily
on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often
challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components.
To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with
implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually
requires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of
the current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of
channel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among
the received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant
achievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning
methods based on traditional channel estimation.

  This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the
transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum
efficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical
coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for
the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address
this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated
under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel
settings. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite its complexity, the
proposed DDPG approach significantly outperforms optimization-based algorithms
and double deep Q-learning, particularly in scenarios with random user
distributions.

\\
  This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrated novel approach
to Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)-based wheelchair development, utilizing a
motor imagery right-left-hand movement mechanism for control. The system is
designed to simulate wheelchair navigation based on motor imagery right and
left-hand movements using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. A pre-filtered
dataset, obtained from an open-source EEG repository, was segmented into arrays
of 19x200 to capture the onset of hand movements. The data was acquired at a
sampling frequency of 200Hz. The system integrates a Tkinter-based interface
for simulating wheelchair movements, offering users a functional and intuitive
control system. We propose a BiLSTM-BiGRU model that shows a superior test
accuracy of 92.26% as compared with various machine learning baseline models,
including XGBoost, EEGNet, and a transformer-based model. The Bi-LSTM-BiGRU
attention-based model achieved a mean accuracy of 90.13% through
cross-validation, showcasing the potential of attention mechanisms in BCI

Title: Annotation-Efficient Active Test-Time Adaptation with Conformal

Authors: Tingyu Shi, Fan Lyu, Shaoliang Peng
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain
shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing
methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection
efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed
uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K
certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage,
a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

Authors: Hung-Ying Chu, Shao-Yu Wei, Guan-Wei Chen, Tzu-Wei Hung, ChengYang

Categories: cs.SD cs.AI
\\
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have created new
opportunities for symbolic music generation. However, existing formats such as
MIDI, ABC, and MusicXML are either overly complex or structurally inconsistent,
limiting their suitability for token-based learning architectures. To address
these challenges, we propose HNote, a novel hexadecimal-based notation system
extended from YNote, which encodes both pitch and duration within a fixed
32-unit measure framework. This design ensures alignment, reduces ambiguity,
and is directly compatible with LLM architectures. We converted 12,300
Jiangnan-style songs generated from traditional folk pieces from YNote into
HNote, and fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1(8B) using parameter-efficient LoRA.
Experimental results show that HNote achieves a syntactic correctness rate of
82.5%, and BLEU and ROUGE evaluations demonstrate strong symbolic and
structural similarity, producing stylistically coherent compositions. This
study establishes HNote as an effective framework for integrating LLMs with
cultural music modeling.

  Current search techniques are limited to standard RAG query-document
applications. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to expand the code

end-to-end code generation for auto-completion and agentic AI applications. We
address the problem of API leaks in current code-to-code benchmark datasets by
introducing a new dataset built from real-world ServiceNow Script Includes that
capture the challenge of unclear API usage intent in the code. Our evaluation
metrics show that this method achieves 87.86% top-40 retrieval accuracy,
allowing the critical context with APIs needed for successful downstream code
generation. To enable real-time predictions, we develop a comprehensive
post-training pipeline that optimizes a compact 0.6B reranker through synthetic
dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. This
approach enables our compact reranker to outperform a much larger 8B model
while maintaining 2.5x reduced latency, effectively addressing the nuances of
enterprise-specific code without the computational overhead of larger models.

  We introduce the first version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX), a
benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform knowledge work
with high economic value. APEX addresses one of the largest inefficiencies in
AI research: outside of coding, benchmarks often fail to test economically
relevant capabilities. APEX-v1.0 contains 200 test cases and covers four
domains: investment banking, management consulting, law, and primary medical
care. It was built in three steps. First, we sourced experts with top-tier
experience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created
prompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts
created rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models
on APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieves the highest
mean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking =
On) (60.4%). Qwen 3 235B is the best performing open-source model and seventh
best overall. There is a large gap between the performance of even the best
models and human experts, highlighting the need for better measurement of
models' ability to produce economically valuable work.

Title: Towards A Universally Transferable Acceleration Method for Density
  Functional Theory
Authors: Zhe Liu, Yuyan Ni, Zhichen Pu, Qiming Sun, Siyuan Liu, Wen Yan
Categories: physics.chem-ph cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Recently, sophisticated deep learning-based approaches have been developed
for generating efficient initial guesses to accelerate the convergence of
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the actual initial guesses
are often density matrices (DM), quantities that can convert into density
matrices also qualify as alternative forms of initial guesses. Hence, existing
works mostly rely on the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix for obtaining
high-quality initial guesses. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both
numerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering
the application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose
a method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density
in a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural
networks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to
achieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems
up to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric
models. Critically, this acceleration remains nearly constant with increasing
system sizes and exhibits strong transferring behaviors across orbital basis
sets and exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. To the best of our knowledge,
this work represents the first and robust candidate for a universally
transferable DFT acceleration method. We are also releasing the SCFbench
dataset and its accompanying code to facilitate future research in this
promising direction.

\\
  Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

Comments: This work is under submission to ICLR 2026. Please cite the arXiv

\\
  Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

  Analyzing financial transactions is crucial for ensuring regulatory
compliance, detecting fraud, and supporting decisions. The complexity of
financial transaction data necessitates advanced techniques to extract
meaningful insights and ensure accurate analysis. Since Transformer-based
models have shown outstanding performance across multiple domains, this paper
seeks to explore their potential in understanding financial transactions. This
paper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer
models: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type,
we explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small
proprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while
LLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive
capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not
significantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of
financial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in
terms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique
requirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower
operational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the
financial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection
based on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of
customized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized
applications. Ultimately, we chose to implement a proprietary decoder-only
model to handle the complex transactions that we previously couldn't manage.
This model can help us to improve 14% transaction coverage, and save more than
\$13 million annual cost.

\\
  This study aims to develop and evaluate an ensemble machine learning-based
framework for the automatic detection of Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia (WCT)
from ECG signals, emphasizing diagnostic accuracy and interpretability using
Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques,
i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost
and LightGBM. The models were trained and tested on ECG data from the publicly
available MIMIC-IV dataset. The testing was carried out with the assistance of
accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error
rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The
CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of
94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics.
SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG
features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby
fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize
CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model.

Title: Learning to Reason as Action Abstractions with Scalable Mid-Training RL
Authors: Shenao Zhang, Donghan Yu, Yihao Feng, Bowen Jin, Zhaoran Wang, John
  Peebles, Zirui Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL stat.ML
\\
  Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

Title: Supporting Creative Ownership through Deep Learning-Based Music
  Variation
Authors: Stephen James Krol, Maria Teresa Llano, Jon McCormack
Categories: cs.HC cs.AI
Comments: Paper Accepted NeurIPS Creative AI Track 2025
\\
  This paper investigates the importance of personal ownership in musical AI
design, examining how practising musicians can maintain creative control over
the compositional process. Through a four-week ecological evaluation, we
examined how a music variation tool, reliant on the skill of musicians,
functioned within a composition setting. Our findings demonstrate that the
dependence of the tool on the musician's ability, to provide a strong initial
musical input and to turn moments into complete musical ideas, promoted
ownership of both the process and artefact. Qualitative interviews further
revealed the importance of this personal ownership, highlighting tensions
between technological capability and artistic identity. These findings provide
insight into how musical AI can support rather than replace human creativity,
highlighting the importance of designing tools that preserve the humanness of
musical expression.

Title: Distillation of Large Language Models via Concrete Score Matching
Authors: Yeongmin Kim, Donghyeok Shin, Mina Kang, Byeonghu Na, Il-Chul Moon
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

Title: RAE: A Neural Network Dimensionality Reduction Method for Nearest
  Neighbors Preservation in Vector Search
Authors: Han Zhang, Dongfang Zhao
Categories: cs.IR cs.AI cs.DB
Comments: submitted to ICLR 2026
\\
  While high-dimensional embedding vectors are being increasingly employed in
various tasks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Recommendation Systems,
popular dimensionality reduction (DR) methods such as PCA and UMAP have rarely
been adopted for accelerating the retrieval process due to their inability of
preserving the nearest neighbor (NN) relationship among vectors. Empowered by
neural networks' optimization capability and the bounding effect of Rayleigh
quotient, we propose a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) for k-NN preserving
dimensionality reduction. RAE constrains the network parameter variation
through regularization terms, adjusting singular values to control embedding
magnitude changes during reduction, thus preserving k-NN relationships. We
provide a rigorous mathematical analysis demonstrating that regularization
establishes an upper bound on the norm distortion rate of transformed vectors,
thereby offering provable guarantees for k-NN preservation. With modest
training overhead, RAE achieves superior k-NN recall compared to existing DR
approaches while maintaining fast retrieval efficiency.

Title: S$^2$FS: Spatially-Aware Separability-Driven Feature Selection in Fuzzy
  Decision Systems
Authors: Suping Xu, Chuyi Dai, Ye Liu, Lin Shang, Xibei Yang, Witold Pedrycz
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

Title: Knapsack RL: Unlocking Exploration of LLMs via Optimizing Budget
  Allocation
Authors: Ziniu Li and Congliang Chen and Tianyun Yang and Tian Ding and Ruoyu
  Sun and Ge Zhang and Wenhao Huang and Zhi-Quan Luo
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

Comments: 14 pages, 12 figures
\\
  Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though
image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation
generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement.
In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for
vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a
Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the
frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable
polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation
across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and
temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a
Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus
achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce
sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency
and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods.
Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the
robustness and compatibility of our approach.

Title: Efficient On-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Exploration of Sparse
  Parameter Space
Authors: Xinyu Zhang, Aishik Deb, Klaus Mueller
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 16 pages; 7 figures
\\
  Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

  Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables systematic
delineation of cellular states and interactions, providing crucial insights
into cellular heterogeneity. Building on this potential, numerous computational
methods have been developed for tasks such as cell clustering, cell type
annotation, and marker gene identification. To fully assess and compare these
methods, standardized, analysis-ready datasets are essential. However, such
datasets remain scarce, and variations in data formats, preprocessing
workflows, and annotation strategies hinder reproducibility and complicate
systematic evaluation of existing methods. To address these challenges, we
present scUnified, an AI-ready standardized resource for single-cell RNA
sequencing data that consolidates 13 high-quality datasets spanning two species
(human and mouse) and nine tissue types. All datasets undergo standardized
quality control and preprocessing and are stored in a uniform format to enable
direct application in diverse computational analyses without additional data
cleaning. We further demonstrate the utility of scUnified through experimental
analyses of representative biological tasks, providing a reproducible
foundation for the standardized evaluation of computational methods on a

  Augmented Reality
Authors: Conghao Zhou, Jie Gao, Shisheng Hu, Nan Cheng, Weihua Zhuang, Xuemin

Categories: cs.NI cs.AI
Comments: accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing
\\
  Future 6G networks are envisioned to facilitate edge-assisted mobile
augmented reality (MAR) via strengthening the collaboration between MAR devices
and edge servers. In order to provide immersive user experiences, MAR devices
must timely upload camera frames to an edge server for simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM)-based device pose tracking. In this paper, to
cope with user-specific and non-stationary uplink data traffic, we develop a
digital twin (DT)-based approach for user-centric communication service
provision for MAR. Specifically, to establish DTs for individual MAR devices,
we first construct a data model customized for MAR that captures the intricate
impact of the SLAM-based frame uploading mechanism on the user-specific data
traffic pattern. We then define two DT operation functions that cooperatively
enable adaptive switching between different data-driven models for capturing
non-stationary data traffic. Leveraging the user-oriented data management
introduced by DTs, we propose an algorithm for network resource management that
ensures the timeliness of frame uploading and the robustness against inherent
inaccuracies in data traffic modeling for individual MAR devices. Trace-driven
simulation results demonstrate that the user-centric communication service
provision achieves a 14.2% increase in meeting the camera frame uploading delay
requirement in comparison with the slicing-based communication service
provision widely used for 5G.

Title: From MNIST to ImageNet: Understanding the Scalability Boundaries of
  Differentiable Logic Gate Networks
Authors: Sven Br\"andle, Till Aczel, Andreas Plesner and Roger Wattenhofer
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Title: AIM: Adaptive Intervention for Deep Multi-task Learning of Molecular
  Properties
Authors: Mason Minot, Gisbert Schneider
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI physics.chem-ph
Comments: 13 pages, 3 figures, 9 tables
\\
  Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

  Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Title: Reconcile Certified Robustness and Accuracy for DNN-based Smoothed
  Majority Vote Classifier
Authors: Gaojie Jin, Xinping Yi, Xiaowei Huang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Under Review
\\
  Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

  The growing complexity of log data in modern software systems has prompted
the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated log analysis. Current
approaches typically rely on direct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on log-label
pairs. However, this exacerbates the domain discrepancy between general-purpose
LLMs and specialized log data, causing overfitting. Furthermore, SFT's
imbalanced loss computation often allows lengthy contexts to overwhelm
critical, concise details in model answers, leading to hallucinations. To
address these limitations, we propose R-Log, a novel reasoning-based paradigm
that mirrors the structured, step-by-step analytical process of human
engineers. This approach enhances generalizability by learning the underlying
rules behind conclusions. We further employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimize the model within a simulated O&M environment, thereby reducing
hallucinations by directly rewarding correct outcomes. R-Log is first
cold-started on a curated dataset of 2k+ reasoning trajectories, guided by 13
strategies from manual O&M practices, to establish an initial reasoning
capability. This ability is then refined via RL using a joint reward function.
Empirical evaluations on real-world logs show that R-Log outperforms existing
methods across five log analysis tasks, particularly in unseen scenarios (by
228.05%). We also designed R-Log-fast with 5x speedup while keeping 93% of the
efficacy.

Title: Indirect Attention: Turning Context Misalignment into a Feature
Authors: Bissmella Bahaduri, Hicham Talaoubrid, Fangchen Feng, Zuheng Ming,

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

Title: Muon Outperforms Adam in Tail-End Associative Memory Learning
Authors: Shuche Wang, Fengzhuo Zhang, Jiaxiang Li, Cunxiao Du, Chao Du, Tianyu
  Pang, Zhuoran Yang, Mingyi Hong, Vincent Y. F. Tan
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

Title: Real-time Noise Detection and Classification in Single-Channel EEG: A
  Lightweight Machine Learning Approach for EMG, White Noise, and EOG Artifacts
Authors: Hossein Enshaei, Pariya Jebreili, Sayed Mahmoud Sakahei
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE
\\
  Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.

artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

Title: On Computing Top-$k$ Simple Shortest Paths from a Single Source
Authors: Mattia D'Emidio and Gabriele Di Stefano
Categories: cs.DS cs.AI cs.IR cs.NI
Comments: 21 pages, 2 figures, to be published in ALENEX 2026
\\
  We investigate the problem of computing the top-$k$ simple shortest paths in
weighted digraphs. While the single-pair variant -- finding the top-$k$ simple
shortest paths between two specified vertices -- has been extensively studied
over the past decades, with Yen's algorithm and its heuristic improvements
emerging as the most effective solving strategies, relatively little attention
has been devoted to the more general single-source version, where the goal is
determining top-$k$ simple shortest paths from a source vertex to all other
vertices. Motivated by the numerous practical applications of ranked shortest
paths, in this paper we provide new insights and algorithmic contributions to
this problem. In particular, we first present a theoretical characterization of
the structural properties of its solutions. Then, we introduce the first
polynomial-time algorithm specifically designed to handle it. On the one hand,
we prove our new algorithm is on par, in terms of time complexity, with the
best (and only) polynomial-time approach known in the literature to solve the
problem, that is applying the fastest single-pair algorithm independently to
each vertex pair formed by the source and the remaining vertices. On the other
hand, through an extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and
synthetic graphs, we demonstrate that our algorithm consistently and
significantly outperforms the latter baseline in terms of running time,
achieving speed-ups of up to several orders of magnitude. These results
establish our new algorithm as the solution to be preferred for computing $k$
simple shortest paths from a single source in practical settings.

Title: Enhancing PINN Performance Through Lie Symmetry Group
Authors: Ali Haider Shah, Naveed R. Butt, Asif Ahmad, Muhammad Omer Bin Saeed
Categories: math.AP cs.AI
\\
  This paper presents intersection of Physics informed neural networks (PINNs)
and Lie symmetry group to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of solving
partial differential equation (PDEs). Various methods have been developed to
solve these equations. A Lie group is an efficient method that can lead to
exact solutions for the PDEs that possessing Lie Symmetry. Leveraging the
concept of infinitesimal generators from Lie symmetry group in a novel manner
within PINN leads to significant improvements in solution of PDEs. In this
study three distinct cases are discussed, each showing progressive improvements
achieved through Lie symmetry modifications and adaptive techniques.
State-of-the-art numerical methods are adopted for comparing the progressive
PINN models. Numerical experiments demonstrate the key role of Lie symmetry in
enhancing PINNs performance, emphasizing the importance of integrating abstract
mathematical concepts into deep learning for addressing complex scientific
problems adequately.

  There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

Title: OWL: Geometry-Aware Spatial Reasoning for Audio Large Language Models
Authors: Subrata Biswas, Mohammad Nur Hossain Khan, Bashima Islam
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI
\\
  Spatial reasoning is fundamental to auditory perception, yet current audio
large language models (ALLMs) largely rely on unstructured binaural cues and
single step inference. This limits both perceptual accuracy in direction and
distance estimation and the capacity for interpretable reasoning. Recent work
such as BAT demonstrates spatial QA with binaural audio, but its reliance on
coarse categorical labels (left, right, up, down) and the absence of explicit
geometric supervision constrain resolution and robustness. We introduce the
$\textbf{Spatial-Acoustic Geometry Encoder (SAGE}$), a geometry-aware audio
encoder that aligns binaural acoustic features with 3D spatial structure using
panoramic depth images and room-impulse responses at training time, while
requiring only audio at inference. Building on this representation, we present
$\textbf{OWL}$, an ALLM that integrates $\textbf{SAGE}$ with a spatially
grounded chain-of-thought to rationalize over direction-of-arrivals (DoA) and
distance estimates. Through curriculum learning from perceptual QA to
multi-step reasoning, $\textbf{OWL}$ supports o'clock-level azimuth and DoA
estimation. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we construct and
release $\textbf{BiDepth}$, a dataset of over one million QA pairs combining
binaural audio with panoramic depth images and room impulse responses across
both in-room and out-of-room scenarios. Across two benchmark datasets, our new
$\textbf{BiDepth}$ and the public SpatialSoundQA, $\textbf{OWL}$ reduces mean
DoA error by $\textbf{11$^{\circ}$}$ through $\textbf{SAGE}$ and improves
spatial reasoning QA accuracy by up to $\textbf{25}$\% over BAT.

Title: Bubble, Bubble, AI's Rumble: Why Global Financial Regulatory Incident
  Reporting is Our Shield Against Systemic Stumbles
Authors: Anchal Gupta, Gleb Pappyshev, James T Kwok
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.CE
\\
  "Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble." As
Shakespeare's witches foretold chaos through cryptic prophecies, modern capital
markets grapple with systemic risks concealed by opaque AI systems. According
to IMF, the August 5, 2024, plunge in Japanese and U.S. equities can be linked
to algorithmic trading yet ab-sent from existing AI incidents database
exemplifies this transparency crisis. Current AI incident databases, reliant on
crowdsourcing or news scraping, systematically over-look capital market
anomalies, particularly in algorithmic and high-frequency trading. We address
this critical gap by proposing a regulatory-grade global database that
elegantly synthesises post-trade reporting frameworks with proven incident
documentation models from healthcare and aviation. Our framework's temporal
data omission technique masking timestamps while preserving percent-age-based
metrics enables sophisticated cross-jurisdictional analysis of emerging risks
while safeguarding confidential business information. Synthetic data validation
(modelled after real life published incidents , sentiments, data) reveals
compelling pat-terns: systemic risks transcending geographical boundaries,
market manipulation clusters distinctly identifiable via K-means algorithms,
and AI system typology exerting significantly greater influence on trading
behaviour than geographical location, This tripartite solution empowers
regulators with unprecedented cross-jurisdictional oversight, financial
institutions with seamless compliance integration, and investors with critical
visibility into previously obscured AI-driven vulnerabilities. We call for
immediate action to strengthen risk management and foster resilience in
AI-driven financial markets against the volatile "cauldron" of AI-driven
systemic risks., promoting global financial stability through enhanced
transparency and coordinated oversight.

  Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

Title: Toward an Unbiased Collective Memory for Efficient LLM-Based Agentic 6G
  Cross-Domain Management
Authors: Hatim Chergui, Miguel Catalan Cid, Pouria Sayyad Khodashenas, Daniel
  Camps Mur and Christos Verikoukis
Categories: cs.NI cs.AI
Comments: 12 pages, 8 figures
\\
  This paper introduces a novel framework for proactive cross-domain resource
orchestration in 6G RAN-Edge networks, featuring large language model
(LLM)-augmented agents. The system comprises specialized RAN (energy
efficiency) and Edge (latency assurance) agents that engage in iterative
negotiation, supported by advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. Agents
dynamically interact with a digital twin (DT) to test their proposals and
leverage a long-term collective memory where their joint successful and failed
agreements along with the related network contexts are distilled into
strategies to either follow or avoid and subsequently stored. Given that agents
are subject to a plethora of cognitive distortions when retrieving those past
experiences -- such as primacy, recency, confirmation and availability biases
-- we propose in this work a novel unbiased memory design (A reusable mockup
version of the unbiased memory source code is available for non-commercial use
at https://github.com/HatimChergui/unbiased-collective-memory). featuring (i)
semantic retrieval of past strategies via Jaccard similarity; (ii) learning
from failures through amplified weighting of SLA violations and mandatory
inclusion of failed negotiation cases to mitigate confirmation bias; (iii)
diversity enforcement to minimize availability bias and (iv) recency and
primacy weighting with slow decay to counteract temporal biases. Evaluation
results showcase the impact of existing biases and how the unbiased memory
allows to tackle them by learning from both successful and failed strategies,
either present or old, resulting in $\times 4.5$ and $\times 3.5$ reductions of
unresolved negotiations compared to non-memory and vanilla memory baselines,
respectively, while totally mitigating SLA violations as well as improving
latency and energy saving distributions.

Title: 3DiFACE: Synthesizing and Editing Holistic 3D Facial Animation
Authors: Balamurugan Thambiraja, Malte Prinzler, Sadegh Aliakbarian, Darren
  Cosker, Justus Thies
Categories: cs.GR cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head
motions remains challenging for current speech-driven 3D facial animation
methods. Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming,
requires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators.
Most existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized
animation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also
overlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the
same audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel
method for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces
diverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and allows for
editing via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a
fully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level
diversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style
personalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise
control and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we
demonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse
holistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between
high fidelity and diversity. Code and models are available here:

Title: Sandbagging in a Simple Survival Bandit Problem

Comments: Forthcoming in the "Reliable ML from Unreliable Data Workshop" at

\\
  Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

  Data quality issues such as off-topic samples, near duplicates, and label

these issues by adapting SelfClean, a representation-to-rank data auditing

self-supervised audio representations to identify common data quality issues,
creating ranked review lists that surface distinct issues within a single,
unified process. The method is benchmarked on the ESC-50, GTZAN, and a
proprietary industrial dataset, using both synthetic and naturally occurring
corruptions. The results demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art ranking performance, often outperforming issue-specific
baselines and enabling significant annotation savings by efficiently guiding
human review.

Title: Noise-Guided Transport for Imitation Learning
Authors: Lionel Blond\'e, Joao A. Candido Ramos, Alexandros Kalousis
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited
number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that
rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult
to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical.
We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that
casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial
training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures,
incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and
tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging
continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under
ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly

  Autonomous exploration and object search in unknown indoor environments
remain challenging for multi-robot systems (MRS). Traditional approaches often
rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot
coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot
Coordinated Exploration and Search), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent coordination of both homogeneous and
heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object
search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier
cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g.,
GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared
environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance
compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners,
achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in
large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural
language-based object search capabilities, allowing human operators to provide
high-level semantic guidance that traditional algorithms cannot interpret.

  Integrating SDN and the IoT enhances network control and flexibility.
DL-based AAD systems improve security by enabling real-time threat detection in
SDN-IoT networks. However, these systems remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that manipulate input data or exploit model weaknesses, significantly
degrading detection accuracy. Existing research lacks a systematic analysis of
adversarial vulnerabilities specific to DL-based AAD systems in SDN-IoT
environments. This SoK study introduces a structured adversarial threat model
and a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks, categorising them into data, model,
and hybrid-level threats. Unlike previous studies, we systematically evaluate
white, black, and grey-box attack strategies across popular benchmark datasets.
Our findings reveal that adversarial attacks can reduce detection accuracy by
up to 48.4%, with Membership Inference causing the most significant drop. C&W
and DeepFool achieve high evasion success rates. However, adversarial training
enhances robustness, and its high computational overhead limits the real-time
deployment of SDN-IoT applications. We propose adaptive countermeasures,
including real-time adversarial mitigation, enhanced retraining mechanisms, and
explainable AI-driven security frameworks. By integrating structured threat
models, this study offers a more comprehensive approach to attack
categorisation, impact assessment, and defence evaluation than previous
research. Our work highlights critical vulnerabilities in existing DL-based AAD
models and provides practical recommendations for improving resilience,
interpretability, and computational efficiency. This study serves as a
foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance
DL-based AAD security in SDN-IoT networks, offering a systematic adversarial
threat model and conceptual defence evaluation based on prior empirical
studies.

  Recently, there has been growing interest in characterizing the function
spaces underlying neural networks. While shallow and deep scalar-valued neural
networks have been linked to scalar-valued reproducing kernel Banach spaces
(RKBS), $\R^d$-valued neural networks and neural operator models remain less
understood in the RKBS setting. To address this gap, we develop a general
definition of vector-valued RKBS (vv-RKBS), which inherently includes the
associated reproducing kernel. Our construction extends existing definitions by
avoiding restrictive assumptions such as symmetric kernel domains,
finite-dimensional output spaces, reflexivity, or separability, while still
recovering familiar properties of vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (vv-RKHS). We then show that shallow $\R^d$-valued neural networks are
elements of a specific vv-RKBS, namely an instance of the integral and neural
vv-RKBS. To also explore the functional structure of neural operators, we
analyze the DeepONet and Hypernetwork architectures and demonstrate that they
too belong to an integral and neural vv-RKBS. In all cases, we establish a
Representer Theorem, showing that optimization over these function spaces
recovers the corresponding neural architectures.

  Planning
Authors: Zichao Shen, Chen Gao, Jiaqi Yuan, Tianchen Zhu, Xingcheng Fu, Qingyun

Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a
close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving
capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,
current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,
existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed
planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In
this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,
state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied
task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to
explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic
revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning
strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action
SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan
based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that
SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal
completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.

  Conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a promising
paradigm for real-time speech interaction. However, their capacity of temporal
dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous
speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational
fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework
to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans
learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic
instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such
as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM
architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art
models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with
fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade
substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in
time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a
foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware
conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website

Title: SeedPrints: Fingerprints Can Even Tell Which Seed Your Large Language
  Model Was Trained From
Authors: Yao Tong, Haonan Wang, Siquan Li, Kenji Kawaguchi, Tianyang Hu
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Fingerprinting Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for provenance
verification and model attribution. Existing methods typically extract post-hoc
signatures based on training dynamics, data exposure, or hyperparameters --
properties that only emerge after training begins. In contrast, we propose a
stronger and more intrinsic notion of LLM fingerprinting: SeedPrints, a method
that leverages random initialization biases as persistent, seed-dependent
identifiers present even before training. We show that untrained models exhibit
reproducible token selection biases conditioned solely on their parameters at
initialization. These biases are stable and measurable throughout training,
enabling our statistical detection method to recover a model's lineage with
high confidence. Unlike prior techniques, unreliable before convergence and
vulnerable to distribution shifts, SeedPrints remains effective across all
training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications.
Experiments on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models show that SeedPrints achieves
seed-level distinguishability and can provide birth-to-lifecycle identity
verification akin to a biometric fingerprint. Evaluations on large-scale
pretrained models and fingerprinting benchmarks further confirm its
effectiveness under practical deployment scenarios. These results suggest that
initialization itself imprints a unique and persistent identity on neural
language models, forming a true ''Galtonian'' fingerprint.

Title: Ascent Fails to Forget
Authors: Ioannis Mavrothalassitis, Pol Puigdemont, Noam Itzhak Levi, Volkan

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: NeurIPS 2025
\\
  Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

Title: AdaBlock-dLLM: Semantic-Aware Diffusion LLM Inference via Adaptive Block
  Size
Authors: Guanxi Lu, Hao (Mark) Chen, Yuto Karashima, Zhican Wang, Daichi

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Preprint. Under review
\\
  Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

\\
  When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

  While the technologies empowering malicious audio deepfakes have dramatically
evolved in recent years due to generative AI advances, the same cannot be said
of global research into spoofing (deepfake) countermeasures. This paper
highlights how current deepfake datasets and research methodologies led to
systems that failed to generalize to real world application. The main reason is
due to the difference between raw deepfake audio, and deepfake audio that has
been presented through a communication channel, e.g. by phone. We propose a new
framework for data creation and research methodology, allowing for the
development of spoofing countermeasures that would be more effective in
real-world scenarios. By following the guidelines outlined here we improved
deepfake detection accuracy by 39% in more robust and realistic lab setups, and
by 57% on a real-world benchmark. We also demonstrate how improvement in
datasets would have a bigger impact on deepfake detection accuracy than the
choice of larger SOTA models would over smaller models; that is, it would be
more important for the scientific community to make greater investment on
comprehensive data collection programs than to simply train larger models with
higher computational demands.

Title: Indoor/Outdoor Spectrum Sharing Enabled by GNSS-based Classifiers
Authors: Hossein Nasiri, Muhammad Iqbal Rochman, and Monisha Ghosh
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI cs.NI
Comments: To be published in the proceedings of IEEE Military Communications
  Conference (MILCOM) 2025
\\
  The desirability of the mid-band frequency range (1 - 10 GHz) for federal and
commercial applications, combined with the growing applications for commercial
indoor use-cases, such as factory automation, opens up a new approach to
spectrum sharing: the same frequency bands used outdoors by federal incumbents
can be reused by commercial indoor users. A recent example of such sharing,
between commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where
unlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor
incumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no
reliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or
outdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor
access points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and
reducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate
indoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling
automatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To
this end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for
I/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and
highly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and
distinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various
methodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning
approaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse
geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone
can achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi)
data, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of
GNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy,
showcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion.

\\
  The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as
motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing.
Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful
properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for
Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
  We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model
architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \$n\$
locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical
foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like
performance.
  BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space
sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits
a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws:
empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at
the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.
  BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during
inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using
spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses
strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept
while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a
graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model
is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human
neurons could use to achieve speech.
  BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse
and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks.
Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and
model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.

  Interpretability is essential for deploying deep learning models in symbolic
music analysis, yet most research emphasizes model performance over
explanation. To address this, we introduce MUSE-Explainer, a new method that
helps reveal how music Graph Neural Network models make decisions by providing
clear, human-friendly explanations. Our approach generates counterfactual
explanations by making small, meaningful changes to musical score graphs that
alter a model's prediction while ensuring the results remain musically
coherent. Unlike existing methods, MUSE-Explainer tailors its explanations to
the structure of musical data and avoids unrealistic or confusing outputs. We
evaluate our method on a music analysis task and show it offers intuitive
insights that can be visualized with standard music tools such as Verovio.

  Foundation Models in Federated Learning

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

  We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar
amp models end-to-end using a combination of an LSTM model and a WaveNet-like
architecture. With \model, one can create a virtual amp by recording samples
that are determined through an ensemble-based active learning strategy to
minimize the amount of datapoints needed (i.e., amp knob settings). Our
strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among
ensemble models, in order to identify the most informative datapoints. MUSHRA

Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Model fingerprinting has emerged as a promising paradigm for claiming model
ownership. However, robustness evaluations of these schemes have mostly focused
on benign perturbations such as incremental fine-tuning, model merging, and
prompting. Lack of systematic investigations into {\em adversarial robustness}
against a malicious model host leaves current systems vulnerable. To bridge
this gap, we first define a concrete, practical threat model against model
fingerprinting. We then take a critical look at existing model fingerprinting
schemes to identify their fundamental vulnerabilities. Based on these, we
develop adaptive adversarial attacks tailored for each vulnerability, and
demonstrate that these can bypass model authentication completely for ten
recently proposed fingerprinting schemes while maintaining high utility of the
model for the end users. Our work encourages fingerprint designers to adopt
adversarial robustness by design. We end with recommendations for future
fingerprinting methods.

  Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

  A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to
retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning
(RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the
significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically
implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,
common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment
interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To
address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data
generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and
preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the
terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation
between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,
OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,
preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from
a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object
configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions
from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour
trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact
preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables
proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30
seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained
with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,
without any learning curriculum.

  This paper presents ActorDB ( Dekigoto ) , a novel database architecture that
tightly integrates a single-writer actor model for writes, Incremental View
Maintenance (IVM), and a zero-trust security model as a core component. The
primary contribution of this work is the unification of these powerful but

We argue that by providing these capabilities out-of-the-box, ActorDB can offer
a more robust, secure, and developer-friendly platform compared to solutions
that require manual integration of separate systems for actor persistence,
stream processing, and security. We present the core architecture, discuss the
critical trade-offs in its design, and define the performance criteria for a

Authors: Yuepeng Hu, Zhengyuan Jiang, Mengyuan Li, Osama Ahmed, Zhicong Huang,
  Cheng Hong, Neil Gong
Categories: cs.CR cs.CL
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are often modified after release through
post-processing such as post-training or quantization, which makes it
challenging to determine whether one model is derived from another. Existing
provenance detection methods have two main limitations: (1) they embed signals
into the base model before release, which is infeasible for already published
models, or (2) they compare outputs across models using hand-crafted or random
prompts, which are not robust to post-processing. In this work, we propose
LLMPrint, a novel detection framework that constructs fingerprints by
exploiting LLMs' inherent vulnerability to prompt injection. Our key insight is
that by optimizing fingerprint prompts to enforce consistent token preferences,
we can obtain fingerprints that are both unique to the base model and robust to
post-processing. We further develop a unified verification procedure that
applies to both gray-box and black-box settings, with statistical guarantees.
We evaluate LLMPrint on five base models and around 700 post-trained or
quantized variants. Our results show that LLMPrint achieves high true positive
rates while keeping false positive rates near zero.

\\
  Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

Title: Can VLM Pseudo-Labels Train a Time-Series QA Model That Outperforms the
  VLM?
Authors: Takuya Fujimura and Kota Dohi and Natsuo Yamashita and Yohei Kawaguchi
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL eess.SP
\\
  Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Title: Rotation Control Unlearning: Quantifying and Controlling Continuous
  Unlearning for LLM with The Cognitive Rotation Space
Authors: Xiang Zhang, Kun Wei, Xu Yang, Chenghao Xu, Su Yan, Cheng Deng
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

Title: CAST: Continuous and Differentiable Semi-Structured Sparsity-Aware
  Training for Large Language Models
Authors: Weiyu Huang, Yuezhou Hu, Jun Zhu, and Jianfei Chen
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
Comments: Submitted to IEEE TPAMI
\\
  Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Comments: accepted at ECAI 2025
\\
  Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

\\
  Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

Title: Thinking-Free Policy Initialization Makes Distilled Reasoning Models
  More Effective and Efficient Reasoners
Authors: Xin Xu, Cliveb AI, Kai Yang, Tianhao Chen, Yang Wang, Saiyong Yang,

Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

  Large audio-language models are advancing rapidly, yet most evaluations
emphasize speech or globally sourced sounds, overlooking culturally distinctive
cues. This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to
localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but
outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding),
a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese "soundmarks." TAU is built through a pipeline
combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation,
producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by
transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including
Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates
the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more
equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the
global mainstream.

  Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

Title: Hyperbolic Optimization
Authors: Yanke Wang and Kyriakos Flouris
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
Comments: Preprint
\\
  This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

Title: Challenges and Solutions in Selecting Optimal Lossless Data Compression
  Algorithms
Authors: Md. Atiqur Rahman and MM Fazle Rabbi
Categories: cs.IT cs.CV math.IT
Comments: 23 pages
\\
  The rapid growth of digital data has heightened the demand for efficient
lossless compression methods. However, existing algorithms exhibit trade-offs:
some achieve high compression ratios, others excel in encoding or decoding
speed, and none consistently perform best across all dimensions. This mismatch
complicates algorithm selection for applications where multiple performance
metrics are simultaneously critical, such as medical imaging, which requires
both compact storage and fast retrieval. To address this challenge, we present
a mathematical framework that integrates compression ratio, encoding time, and
decoding time into a unified performance score. The model normalizes and
balances these metrics through a principled weighting scheme, enabling
objective and fair comparisons among diverse algorithms. Extensive experiments
on image and text datasets validate the approach, showing that it reliably
identifies the most suitable compressor for different priority settings.
Results also reveal that while modern learning-based codecs often provide
superior compression ratios, classical algorithms remain advantageous when
speed is paramount. The proposed framework offers a robust and adaptable
decision-support tool for selecting optimal lossless data compression
techniques, bridging theoretical measures with practical application needs.

  In this work, we present and investigate the novel blind inverse problem of
position-blind ptychography, i.e., ptychographic phase retrieval without any
knowledge of scan positions, which then must be recovered jointly with the
image. The motivation for this problem comes from single-particle diffractive
X-ray imaging, where particles in random orientations are illuminated and a set
of diffraction patterns is collected. If one uses a highly focused X-ray beam,
the measurements would also become sensitive to the beam positions relative to
each particle and therefore ptychographic, but these positions are also
unknown. We investigate the viability of image reconstruction in a simulated,
simplified 2-D variant of this difficult problem, using variational inference
with modern data-driven image priors in the form of score-based diffusion
models. We find that, with the right illumination structure and a strong prior,
one can achieve reliable and successful image reconstructions even under
measurement noise, in all except the most difficult evaluated imaging scenario.

Title: Anatomy-DT: A Cross-Diffusion Digital Twin for Anatomical Evolution
Authors: Moinak Bhattacharya, Gagandeep Singh, Prateek Prasanna
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Accurately modeling the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor morphology from
baseline imaging is a pre-requisite for developing digital twin frameworks that
can simulate disease progression and treatment response. Most existing
approaches primarily characterize tumor growth while neglecting the concomitant
alterations in adjacent anatomical structures. In reality, tumor evolution is
highly non-linear and heterogeneous, shaped not only by therapeutic
interventions but also by its spatial context and interaction with neighboring
tissues. Therefore, it is critical to model tumor progression in conjunction
with surrounding anatomy to obtain a comprehensive and clinically relevant
understanding of disease dynamics. We introduce a mathematically grounded
framework that unites mechanistic partial differential equations with
differentiable deep learning. Anatomy is represented as a multi-class
probability field on the simplex and evolved by a cross-diffusion
reaction-diffusion system that enforces inter-class competition and
exclusivity. A differentiable implicit-explicit scheme treats stiff diffusion
implicitly while handling nonlinear reaction and event terms explicitly,
followed by projection back to the simplex. To further enhance global
plausibility, we introduce a topology regularizer that simultaneously enforces
centerline preservation and penalizes region overlaps. The approach is
validated on synthetic datasets and a clinical dataset. On synthetic
benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving
topology, and also demonstrates superior performance on the clinical dataset.
By integrating PDE dynamics, topology-aware regularization, and differentiable
solvers, this work establishes a principled path toward anatomy-to-anatomy
generation for digital twins that are visually realistic, anatomically
exclusive, and topologically consistent.

  High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, providing

labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments.
To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online

map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data,
our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates,

\\
  Lip-to-speech (L2S) synthesis for Mandarin is a significant challenge,
hindered by complex viseme-to-phoneme mappings and the critical role of lexical
tones in intelligibility. To address this issue, we propose Lexical Tone-Aware
Lip-to-Speech (LTA-L2S). To tackle viseme-to-phoneme complexity, our model
adapts an English pre-trained audio-visual self-supervised learning (SSL) model
via a cross-lingual transfer learning strategy. This strategy not only
transfers universal knowledge learned from extensive English data to the
Mandarin domain but also circumvents the prohibitive cost of training such a
model from scratch. To specifically model lexical tones and enhance
intelligibility, we further employ a flow-matching model to generate the F0
contour. This generation process is guided by ASR-fine-tuned SSL speech units,
which contain crucial suprasegmental information. The overall speech quality is
then elevated through a two-stage training paradigm, where a flow-matching
postnet refines the coarse spectrogram from the first stage. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LTA-L2S significantly outperforms existing methods
in both speech intelligibility and tonal accuracy.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as a next-generation
paradigm for robotics. We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages
a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning,
and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception,
language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling
stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions
and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by
incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV
caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We
evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,
it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,
consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real
Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging
bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust
real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of
unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.

Title: Reweighted Flow Matching via Unbalanced OT for Label-free Long-tailed
  Generation
Authors: Hyunsoo Song, Minjung Gim, Jaewoong Choi
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
Comments: 28 pages, 17 figures
\\
  Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

  This paper presents GaussEdit, a framework for adaptive 3D scene editing
guided by text and image prompts. GaussEdit leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as
its backbone for scene representation, enabling convenient Region of Interest
selection and efficient editing through a three-stage process. The first stage
involves initializing the 3D Gaussians to ensure high-quality edits. The second
stage employs an Adaptive Global-Local Optimization strategy to balance global
scene coherence and detailed local edits and a category-guided regularization
technique to alleviate the Janus problem. The final stage enhances the texture
of the edited objects using a sophisticated image-to-image synthesis technique,
ensuring that the results are visually realistic and align closely with the

successfully embedding user-specified concepts into 3D scenes, GaussEdit is a
powerful tool for detailed and user-driven 3D scene editing, offering
significant improvements over traditional methods.

Title: Multi-modal Liver Segmentation and Fibrosis Staging Using Real-world MRI
  Images
Authors: Yang Zhou, Kunhao Yuan, Ye Wei, Jishizhan Chen
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Liver fibrosis represents the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix
caused by sustained hepatic injury. It disrupts normal lobular architecture and
function, increasing the chances of cirrhosis and liver failure. Precise
staging of fibrosis for early diagnosis and intervention is often invasive,
which carries risks and complications. To address this challenge, recent
advances in artificial intelligence-based liver segmentation and fibrosis
staging offer a non-invasive alternative. As a result, the CARE 2025 Challenge
aimed for automated methods to quantify and analyse liver fibrosis in
real-world scenarios, using multi-centre, multi-modal, and multi-phase MRI
data. This challenge included tasks of precise liver segmentation (LiSeg) and
fibrosis staging (LiFS). In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for
both tasks across all the provided MRI modalities. This pipeline integrates
pseudo-labelling based on multi-modal co-registration, liver segmentation using
deep neural networks, and liver fibrosis staging based on shape, textural,
appearance, and directional (STAD) features derived from segmentation masks and
MRI images. By solely using the released data with limited annotations, our

Title: Ordinal Label-Distribution Learning with Constrained Asymmetric Priors

  Diabetic retinopathy grading is inherently ordinal and long-tailed, with
minority stages being scarce, heterogeneous, and clinically critical to detect
accurately. Conventional methods often rely on isotropic Gaussian priors and
symmetric loss functions, misaligning latent representations with the task's
asymmetric nature. We propose the Constrained Asymmetric Prior Wasserstein
Autoencoder (CAP-WAE), a novel framework that addresses these challenges
through three key innovations. Our approach employs a Wasserstein Autoencoder
(WAE) that aligns its aggregate posterior with a asymmetric prior, preserving
the heavy-tailed and skewed structure of minority classes. The latent space is
further structured by a Margin-Aware Orthogonality and Compactness (MAOC) loss
to ensure grade-ordered separability. At the supervision level, we introduce a
direction-aware ordinal loss, where a lightweight head predicts asymmetric
dispersions to generate soft labels that reflect clinical priorities by
penalizing under-grading more severely. Stabilized by an adaptive multi-task
weighting scheme, our end-to-end model requires minimal tuning. Across public
DR benchmarks, CAP-WAE consistently achieves state-of-the-art Quadratic
Weighted Kappa, accuracy, and macro-F1, surpassing both ordinal classification
and latent generative baselines. t-SNE visualizations further reveal that our
method reshapes the latent manifold into compact, grade-ordered clusters with
reduced overlap.

  Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

  Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI
applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and
challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level
semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess
the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual
and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a
reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents
the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond
shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,
and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural
images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple
images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting
real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived
either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of
public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,
current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,
the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but
only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the
increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further
advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and
evaluation code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/MR2-Bench.

  The gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans can have a wide variety of aberrant
mucosal abnormality findings, ranging from mild irritations to extremely fatal
illnesses. Prompt identification of gastrointestinal disorders greatly
contributes to arresting the progression of the illness and improving
therapeutic outcomes. This paper presents an ensemble of pre-trained vision
transformers (ViTs) for accurately classifying endoscopic images of the GI
tract to categorize gastrointestinal problems and illnesses. ViTs,
attention-based neural networks, have revolutionized image recognition by
leveraging the transformative power of the transformer architecture, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various visual tasks. The proposed
model was evaluated on the publicly available HyperKvasir dataset with 10,662
images of 23 different GI diseases for the purpose of identifying GI tract
diseases. An ensemble method is proposed utilizing the predictions of two
pre-trained models, MobileViT_XS and MobileViT_V2_200, which achieved
accuracies of 90.57% and 90.48%, respectively. All the individual models are
outperformed by the ensemble model, GastroViT, with an average precision,
recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 69%, 63%, 64%, and 91.98%, respectively, in
the first testing that involves 23 classes. The model comprises only 20 million
(M) parameters, even without data augmentation and despite the highly
imbalanced dataset. For the second testing with 16 classes, the scores are even
higher, with average precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 87%, 86%,
87%, and 92.70%, respectively. Additionally, the incorporation of explainable
AI (XAI) methods such as Grad-CAM (Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping)
and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) enhances model interpretability,
providing valuable insights for reliable GI diagnosis in real-world settings.

Title: Automated and Scalable SEM Image Analysis of Perovskite Solar Cell
  Materials via a Deep Segmentation Framework
Authors: Jian Guo Pan and Lin Wang and Xia Cai
Categories: cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.CV
\\
  Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is indispensable for characterizing the
microstructure of thin films during perovskite solar cell fabrication. Accurate
identification and quantification of lead iodide and perovskite phases are
critical because residual lead iodide strongly influences crystallization
pathways and defect formation, while the morphology of perovskite grains
governs carrier transport and device stability. Yet current SEM image analysis
is still largely manual, limiting throughput and consistency. Here, we present
an automated deep learning-based framework for SEM image segmentation that
enables precise and efficient identification of lead iodide, perovskite and
defect domains across diverse morphologies. Built upon an improved YOLOv8x
architecture, our model named PerovSegNet incorporates two novel modules: (i)
Adaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block, which enhances multi-scale and
fine-grained feature extraction through group convolutions and channel mixing;
and (ii) Separable Adaptive Downsampling module, which jointly preserves
fine-scale textures and large-scale structures for more robust boundary
recognition. Trained on an augmented dataset of 10,994 SEM images, PerovSegNet
achieves a mean Average Precision of 87.25% with 265.4 Giga Floating Point
Operations, outperforming the baseline YOLOv8x-seg by 4.08%, while reducing
model size and computational load by 24.43% and 25.22%, respectively. Beyond
segmentation, the framework provides quantitative grain-level metrics, such as
lead iodide/perovskite area and count, which can serve as reliable indicators
of crystallization efficiency and microstructural quality. These capabilities
establish PerovSegNet as a scalable tool for real-time process monitoring and
data-driven optimization of perovskite thin-film fabrication.The source code is

Title: Tuning the Tuner: Introducing Hyperparameter Optimization for
  Auto-Tuning
Authors: Floris-Jan Willemsen, Rob V. van Nieuwpoort, Ben van Werkhoven
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC cs.PF
\\
  Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

  Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and
multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate
that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these
modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring
Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at
https://github.com/infinigence/HamiltonAttention.

Title: Heterogeneous Multi-agent Collaboration in UAV-assisted Mobile
  Crowdsensing Networks
Authors: Xianyang Deng, Wenshuai Liu, Yaru FuB, and Qi Zhu
Categories: cs.LG cs.MA
Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

Title: A General Theory of Emergent Linearity in Complex Dynamical Systems: The
  Role of Spatial Averaging and Vanishing Correlations
Authors: Sabbir Ahmed, Hafiz Fareed Ahmed, and Erfan Nozari
Categories: math.DS cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY math.OC math.PR
\\
  Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human
brain, have been described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. Despite
their vast differences, these systems are often similar in being comprised of
numerous microscopic subsystems with complex nonlinear dynamics and
interactions that give rise to diverse emergent macroscopic behaviors. As such,
a long-standing question across various fields has been to understand why and
how various forms of macroscopic behavior emerge from underlying microscopic
dynamics. Motivated by a growing body of empirical observations, in this work
we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system
dynamics, and develop a general theoretical framework for the interplay between
spatial averaging, decaying microscopic correlations, and emergent macroscopic
linearity. Using and extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that in
a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the
average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number
of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that (in addition to technical
assumptions) pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their
pairwise distance grows to infinity. We prove this result when the latter
distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and
provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample
analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems
with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous
analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked
systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical
analyses in various domains of science and engineering.

Comments: 10 pages, 5 tables, 2 code listings. Specification proposal available
  at https://github.com/subramanya1997/oidc-a/
\\
  OpenID Connect for Agents (OIDC-A) 1.0 is an extension to OpenID Connect Core
1.0 that provides a comprehensive framework for representing, authenticating,
and authorizing LLM-based agents within the OAuth 2.0 ecosystem. As autonomous
AI agents become increasingly prevalent in digital systems, there is a critical
need for standardized protocols to establish agent identity, verify agent
attestation, represent delegation chains, and enable fine-grained authorization
based on agent attributes. This specification defines standard claims,
endpoints, and protocols that address these requirements while maintaining
compatibility with existing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect infrastructure. The
proposed framework introduces mechanisms for agent identity representation,
delegation chain validation, attestation verification, and capability-based
authorization, providing a foundation for secure and trustworthy
agent-to-service interactions in modern distributed systems.
