Title: Situation Model of the Transport, Transport Emissions and Meteorological
  Conditions
Authors: V. Benes, M. Svitek, A. Michalikova, M. Melicherik
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Air pollution in cities and the possibilities of reducing this pollution
represents one of the most important factors that today's society has to deal
with. This paper focuses on a systemic approach to traffic emissions with their
relation to meteorological conditions, analyzing the effect of weather on the
quantity and dispersion of traffic emissions in a city. Using fuzzy inference
systems (FIS) the model for prediction of changes in emissions depending on
various conditions is developed. The proposed model is based on traffic,
meteorology and emission data measured in Prague, Czech Republic. The main
objective of the work is to provide insight into how urban planners and
policymakers can plan and manage urban transport more effectively with
environmental protection in mind.

Title: ZapGPT: Free-form Language Prompting for Simulated Cellular Control
Authors: Nam H. Le, Patrick Erickson, Yanbo Zhang, Michael Levin and Josh
  Bongard
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA q-bio.CB
\\
  Human language is one of the most expressive tools for conveying intent, yet
most artificial or biological systems lack mechanisms to interpret or respond
meaningfully to it. Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of
control over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent
work explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still
depend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets,
limiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in
synthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often
genomic rather than environmental perturbation.
  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be
guided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or
carefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by
showing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be
guided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative
prompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI
model scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and
the former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.
  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness
functions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system
generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining. By treating natural language
as a control layer, the system suggests a future in which spoken or written
prompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems to desired
behaviors. This work provides a concrete step toward this vision of AI-biology
partnerships, in which language replaces mathematical objective functions,
fixed rules, and domain-specific programming.

Title: Maestro: Self-Improving Text-to-Image Generation via Agent Orchestration

Categories: cs.AI cs.CV

  including references and appendices)
\\
  Text-to-image (T2I) models, while offering immense creative potential, are
highly reliant on human intervention, posing significant usability challenges
that often necessitate manual, iterative prompt engineering over often
underspecified prompts. This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving
image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve
generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial
prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where
specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify
weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide
interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent
while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge
for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing
problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with
user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models
demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial
prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with
more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and
effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.

Title: Understanding AI Evaluation Patterns: How Different GPT Models Assess
  Vision-Language Descriptions
Authors: Sajjad Abdoli, Rudi Cilibrasi, Rima Al-Shikh
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  As AI systems increasingly evaluate other AI outputs, understanding their
assessment behavior becomes crucial for preventing cascading biases. This study
analyzes vision-language descriptions generated by NVIDIA's Describe Anything
Model and evaluated by three GPT variants (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5) to
uncover distinct "evaluation personalities" the underlying assessment
strategies and biases each model demonstrates. GPT-4o-mini exhibits systematic
consistency with minimal variance, GPT-4o excels at error detection, while
GPT-5 shows extreme conservatism with high variability. Controlled experiments
using Gemini 2.5 Pro as an independent question generator validate that these
personalities are inherent model properties rather than artifacts. Cross-family
analysis through semantic similarity of generated questions reveals significant
divergence: GPT models cluster together with high similarity while Gemini
exhibits markedly different evaluation strategies. All GPT models demonstrate a
consistent 2:1 bias favoring negative assessment over positive confirmation,
though this pattern appears family-specific rather than universal across AI
architectures. These findings suggest that evaluation competence does not scale
with general capability and that robust AI assessment requires diverse
architectural perspectives.

Title: AI Answer Engine Citation Behavior An Empirical Analysis of the GEO16
  Framework
Authors: Arlen Kumar, Leanid Palkhouski
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  AI answer engines increasingly mediate access to domain knowledge by
generating responses and citing web sources. We introduce GEO-16, a 16 pillar
auditing framework that converts on page quality signals into banded pillar
scores and a normalized GEO score G that ranges from 0 to 1. Using 70 product
intent prompts, we collected 1,702 citations across three engines (Brave
Summary, Google AI Overviews, and Perplexity) and audited 1,100 unique URLs. In
our corpus, the engines differed in the GEO quality of the pages they cited,
and pillars related to Metadata and Freshness, Semantic HTML, and Structured
Data showed the strongest associations with citation. Logistic models with
domain clustered standard errors indicate that overall page quality is a strong
predictor of citation, and simple operating points (for example, G at least
0.70 combined with at least 12 pillar hits) align with substantially higher
citation rates in our data. We report per engine contrasts, vertical effects,
threshold analysis, and diagnostics, then translate findings into a practical
playbook for publishers. The study is observational and focuses on English
language B2B SaaS pages; we discuss limitations, threats to validity, and
reproducibility considerations.

Title: AgentArch: A Comprehensive Benchmark to Evaluate Agent Architectures in
  Enterprise
Authors: Tara Bogavelli, Roshnee Sharma, Hari Subramani
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.MA
\\
  While individual components of agentic architectures have been studied in
isolation, there remains limited empirical understanding of how different
design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems. This study aims
to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific
benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art
large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions:
orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function
calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark
reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the
prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals
significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with
the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the
more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform
the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed
decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.

Title: LLM Enhancement with Domain Expert Mental Model to Reduce LLM
  Hallucination with Causal Prompt Engineering
Authors: Boris Kovalerchuk, Brent D. Fegley
Categories: cs.AI cs.HC
Comments: 25 pages,4 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Difficult decision-making problems abound in various disciplines and domains.
The proliferation of generative techniques, especially large language models
(LLMs), has excited interest in using them for decision support. However, LLMs
cannot yet resolve missingness in their training data, leading to
hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by
incorporating external information retrieval, reducing hallucinations and
improving accuracy. Yet, RAG and related methods are only partial solutions, as
they may lack access to all necessary sources or key missing information. Even
everyday issues often challenge LLMs' abilities. Submitting longer prompts with
context and examples is one approach to address knowledge gaps, but designing
effective prompts is non-trivial and may not capture complex mental models of
domain experts. For tasks with missing critical information, LLMs are
insufficient, as are many existing systems poorly represented in available
documents. This paper explores how LLMs can make decision-making more
efficient, using a running example of evaluating whether to respond to a call
for proposals. We propose a technology based on optimized human-machine
dialogue and monotone Boolean and k-valued functions to discover a
computationally tractable personal expert mental model (EMM) of
decision-making. Our EMM algorithm for LLM prompt engineering has four steps:
(1) factor identification, (2) hierarchical structuring of factors, (3)
generating a generalized expert mental model specification, and (4) generating
a detailed generalized expert mental model from that specification.

Title: From Grounding to Skolemization: A Logic-Constrained Vector Symbolic
  Architecture for Complex Query Answering
Authors: Yuyin Lu, Hegang Chen, Yanghui Rao
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs),
typically formalized as reasoning with Existential First-Order predicate logic
with one free variable (EFO$_1$), faces a fundamental trade-off between logical
soundness and computational efficiency. This work establishes the
Grounding-Skolemization dichotomy for systematically analyzing CQA methods
through the lens of formal logic. While Grounding-based methods inherently
suffer from combinatorial explosion, most Skolemization-based methods neglect
to explicitly model Skolem functions and compromise logical consistency. To
address these limitations, we propose the Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic
Architecture (LVSA), a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies a differentiable
Skolemization module and a neural negator, as well as a logical
constraint-driven optimization protocol to harmonize geometric and logical
requirements. Theoretically, LVSA guarantees universality for all EFO$_1$
queries. Empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based
methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to
Grounding-based baselines.

Title: Is the `Agent' Paradigm a Limiting Framework for Next-Generation
  Intelligent Systems?
Authors: Jesse Gardner, Vladimir A. Baulin
Categories: cs.AI cond-mat.soft
\\
  The concept of the 'agent' has profoundly shaped Artificial Intelligence (AI)
research, guiding development from foundational theories to contemporary
applications like Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems. This paper
critically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric
paradigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent
anthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish
between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g.,
LLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems,
currently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the
impression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant
literature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks,
highlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and
goal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems,
while heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying
computational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an
alternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in
system-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude
that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex
systems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing
towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general
intelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental
reconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the
agent metaphor.

Title: Harmful Prompt Laundering: Jailbreaking LLMs with Abductive Styles and
  Symbolic Encoding
Authors: Seongho Joo, Hyukhun Koh, Kyomin Jung
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP 2025
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, but their potential misuse for harmful purposes remains a
significant concern. To strengthen defenses against such vulnerabilities, it is
essential to investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic
weaknesses in the architecture and learning paradigms of LLMs. In response, we
propose \textbf{H}armful \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{La}undering (HaPLa), a novel
and broadly applicable jailbreaking technique that requires only black-box
access to target models. HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1)
\textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible
intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding
to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight
and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current
LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental
results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series
models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic
encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to
safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in
responding to benign queries.

Title: Public Data Assisted Differentially Private In-Context Learning
Authors: Seongho Joo, Hyukhun Koh, Kyomin Jung
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP 2025 Findings
\\
  In-context learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown
remarkable performance across various tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, recent studies have highlighted the risk of private data leakage
through the prompt in ICL, especially when LLMs are exposed to malicious
attacks. While differential privacy (DP) provides strong privacy guarantees, it
often significantly reduces the utility of in-context learning (ICL). To
address this challenge, we incorporate task-related public data into the ICL
framework while maintaining the DP guarantee. Based on this approach, we
propose a private in-context learning algorithm that effectively balances
privacy protection and model utility. Through experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves the utility of private ICL with the
assistance of public data. Additionally, we show that our method is robust
against membership inference attacks, demonstrating empirical privacy
protection.

Title: Enhancing Computational Cognitive Architectures with LLMs: A Case Study
Authors: Ron Sun
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Computational cognitive architectures are broadly scoped models of the human
mind that combine different psychological functionalities (as well as often
different computational methods for these different functionalities) into one
unified framework. They structure them in a psychologically plausible and
validated way. However, such models thus far have only limited computational
capabilities, mostly limited by the computational tools and techniques that
were adopted. More recently, LLMs have proved to be more capable
computationally than any other tools. Thus, in order to deal with both
real-world complexity and psychological realism at the same time, incorporating
LLMs into cognitive architectures naturally becomes an important task. In the
present article, a synergistic combination of the Clarion cognitive
architecture and LLMs is discussed as a case study. The implicit-explicit
dichotomy that is fundamental to Clarion is leveraged for a seamless
integration of Clarion and LLMs. As a result, computational power of LLMs is
combined with psychological nicety of Clarion.

Title: Rethinking Human Preference Evaluation of LLM Rationales
Authors: Ziang Li, Manasi Ganti, Zixian Ma, Helena Vasconcelos, Qijia He,
  Ranjay Krishna
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: Published in the XLLM-Reason-Plan Workshop on the Application of LLM
  Explainability to Reasoning and Planning at COLM 2025
Journal-ref: Proceedings of the XLLM-Reason-Plan Workshop, Conference on
  Language Modeling (COLM) 2025
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) often generate natural language rationales --
free-form explanations that help improve performance on complex reasoning tasks
and enhance interpretability for human users. However, evaluating these
rationales remains challenging. While recent work has relied on binary
preference judgments from humans or LLM judges, such evaluations are often
opaque and coarse-grained, offering limited insight into what makes one
rationale better than another. In this work, we rethink preference evaluation
for LLM-generated rationales by asking: (1) What attributes define good
rationales? (2) Can human preferences be explained by these attributes? (3) Can
attribute-based evaluation overcome the limitations of binary comparisons? We
identify a set of key rationale attributes from prior literature and assess
them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations. We then
analyze two standard human preference datasets MT Bench and Chatbot Arena using
SHAP to identify which attributes best explain human preference outcomes.
Finally, we re-evaluate model-generated rationales using attribute-specific ELO
scores, revealing more nuanced model comparisons and insights. Our findings
suggest that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize
rationale quality and guide future research toward more interpretable and
reliable evaluation practices.

Title: Free-MAD: Consensus-Free Multi-Agent Debate
Authors: Yu Cui and Hang Fu and Haibin Zhang and Licheng Wang and Cong Zuo
Categories: cs.AI cs.CR
\\
  Multi-agent debate (MAD) is an emerging approach to improving the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing MAD methods rely on
multiple rounds of interaction among agents to reach consensus, and the final
output is selected by majority voting in the last round. However, this
consensus-based design faces several limitations. First, multiple rounds of
communication increases token overhead and limits scalability. Second, due to
the inherent conformity of LLMs, agents that initially produce correct
responses may be influenced by incorrect ones during the debate process,
causing error propagation. Third, majority voting introduces randomness and
unfairness in the decision-making phase, and can degrade the reasoning
performance.
  To address these issues, we propose \textsc{Free-MAD}, a novel MAD framework
that eliminates the need for consensus among agents. \textsc{Free-MAD}
introduces a novel score-based decision mechanism that evaluates the entire
debate trajectory rather than relying on the last round only. This mechanism
tracks how each agent's reasoning evolves, enabling more accurate and fair
outcomes. In addition, \textsc{Free-MAD} reconstructs the debate phase by
introducing anti-conformity, a mechanism that enables agents to mitigate
excessive influence from the majority. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets
demonstrate that \textsc{Free-MAD} significantly improves reasoning performance
while requiring only a single-round debate and thus reducing token costs. We
also show that compared to existing MAD approaches, \textsc{Free-MAD} exhibits
improved robustness in real-world attack scenarios.

  Orchestration
Authors: Liangxuan Guo, Bin Zhu, Qingqian Tao, Kangning Liu, Xun Zhao, Xianzhe

Categories: cs.AI cs.HC cs.MA
\\
  Autonomous agents for desktop automation struggle with complex multi-step
tasks due to poor coordination and inadequate quality control. We introduce
\textsc{Agentic Lybic}, a novel multi-agent system where the entire
architecture operates as a finite-state machine (FSM). This core innovation
enables dynamic orchestration. Our system comprises four components: a
Controller, a Manager, three Workers (Technician for code-based operations,
Operator for GUI interactions, and Analyst for decision support), and an
Evaluator. The critical mechanism is the FSM-based routing between these
components, which provides flexibility and generalization by dynamically
selecting the optimal execution strategy for each subtask. This principled
orchestration, combined with robust quality gating, enables adaptive replanning
and error recovery. Evaluated officially on the OSWorld benchmark,
\textsc{Agentic Lybic} achieves a state-of-the-art 57.07\% success rate in 50
steps, substantially outperforming existing methods. Results demonstrate that
principled multi-agent orchestration with continuous quality control provides
superior reliability for generalized desktop automation in complex computing
environments.

Title: Tractable Asymmetric Verification for Large Language Models via
  Deterministic Replicability
Authors: Zan-Kai Chong, Hiroyuki Ohsaki, Bryan Ng
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) shifts rapidly towards dynamic,
multi-agent systems. This introduces a fundamental challenge in establishing
computational trust, specifically how one agent can verify that another's
output was genuinely produced by a claimed LLM, and not falsified or generated
by a cheaper or inferior model. To address this challenge, this paper proposes
a verification framework that achieves tractable asymmetric effort, where the
cost to verify a computation is substantially lower than the cost to perform
it. Our approach is built upon the principle of deterministic replicability, a
property inherent to autoregressive models that strictly necessitates a
computationally homogeneous environment where all agents operate on identical
hardware and software stacks. Within this defined context, our framework
enables multiple validators to probabilistically audit small, random segments
of an LLM's output and it distributes the verification workload effectively.
The simulations demonstrated that targeted verification can be over 12 times
faster than full regeneration, with tunable parameters to adjust the detection
probability. By establishing a tractable mechanism for auditable LLM systems,
our work offers a foundational layer for responsible AI and serves as a
cornerstone for future research into the more complex, heterogeneous
multi-agent systems.

Title: Patient-Zero: A Unified Framework for Real-Record-Free Patient Agent
  Generation
Authors: Yunghwei Lai, Weizhi Ma, Yang Liu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Synthetic data generation using large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a
promising solution across various domains, particularly in medical field, to
mitigate data collection challenges. However, existing studies mainly utilize
LLMs to rewrite and complete existing medical records, where the limitations in
data privacy, accuracy, and diversity sill exist, and additionally lack the
ability to interact like real patients. To address these issues, we propose a
realistic patient generation framework, Patient-Zero, which requires no real
medical records. Patient-Zero first introduces a medically-aligned multi-step
generation architecture, which builds comprehensive patient records through
hierarchical medical knowledge injection without real medical records. Then, to
optimize the virtual patient's interaction abilities with humans, Patient-Zero
designs a dynamic updating mechanism to improve the consistency and
conversational performance. Our framework enables the generation of
contextually diverse patient records while maintaining strict medical
coherence, supported by adaptive dialogue strategies and real-time clinical
plausibility verification. Experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves good performance in accuracy, diversity, and consistency. After
training with our generated virtual patients, existing models show significant
improvements on the MedQA dataset.

Title: Difficulty-Aware Agent Orchestration in LLM-Powered Workflows

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong
capabilities across various tasks. However, ex- isting multi-agent frameworks
often rely on static or task- level workflows, which either over-process simple
queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the
efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Difficulty- Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a
dynamic frame- work that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM
assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three
interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty
estimation, a modular opera- tor allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware
LLM router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailor- ing
workflows, DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO
outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency
across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon
publication.

Title: Neural cellular automata: applications to biology and beyond classical
  AI
Authors: Benedikt Hartl, Michael Levin, L\'eo Pio-Lopez
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA q-bio.OT
\\
  Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) represent a powerful framework for modeling
biological self-organization, extending classical rule-based systems with
trainable, differentiable (or evolvable) update rules that capture the adaptive
self-regulatory dynamics of living matter. By embedding Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) as local decision-making centers and interaction rules between
localized agents, NCA can simulate processes across molecular, cellular,
tissue, and system-level scales, offering a multiscale competency architecture
perspective on evolution, development, regeneration, aging, morphogenesis, and
robotic control. These models not only reproduce biologically inspired target
patterns but also generalize to novel conditions, demonstrating robustness to
perturbations and the capacity for open-ended adaptation and reasoning. Given
their immense success in recent developments, we here review current literature
of NCAs that are relevant primarily for biological or bioengineering
applications. Moreover, we emphasize that beyond biology, NCAs display robust
and generalizing goal-directed dynamics without centralized control, e.g., in
controlling or regenerating composite robotic morphologies or even on
cutting-edge reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI-1. In addition, the same
principles of iterative state-refinement is reminiscent to modern generative
Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as probabilistic diffusion models. Their
governing self-regulatory behavior is constraint to fully localized
interactions, yet their collective behavior scales into coordinated
system-level outcomes. We thus argue that NCAs constitute a unifying
computationally lean paradigm that not only bridges fundamental insights from
multiscale biology with modern generative AI, but have the potential to design
truly bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning
and control.

Title: AlignKT: Explicitly Modeling Knowledge State for Knowledge Tracing with
  Ideal State Alignment
Authors: Jing Xiao, Chang You, Zhiyu Chen
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Knowledge Tracing (KT) serves as a fundamental component of Intelligent
Tutoring Systems (ITS), enabling these systems to monitor and understand
learners' progress by modeling their knowledge state. However, many existing KT
models primarily focus on fitting the sequences of learners' interactions, and
often overlook the knowledge state itself. This limitation leads to reduced
interpretability and insufficient instructional support from the ITS. To
address this challenge, we propose AlignKT, which employs a frontend-to-backend
architecture to explicitly model a stable knowledge state. In this approach,
the preliminary knowledge state is aligned with an additional criterion.
Specifically, we define an ideal knowledge state based on pedagogical theories
as the alignment criterion, providing a foundation for interpretability. We
utilize five encoders to implement this set-up, and incorporate a contrastive
learning module to enhance the robustness of the alignment process. Through
extensive experiments, AlignKT demonstrates superior performance, outperforming
seven KT baselines on three real-world datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art
results on two of these datasets and exhibits competitive performance on the
third. The code of this work is available at

  Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has rapidly emerged with the
capability to generate different forms of content, including text, images,
videos, and other modalities, which can achieve a quality similar to content
created by humans. As a result, AIGC is now widely applied across various
domains such as digital marketing, education, and public health, and has shown
promising results by enhancing content creation efficiency and improving
information delivery. However, there are few studies that explore the latest
progress and emerging challenges of AIGC across different domains. To bridge
this gap, this paper brings together 16 scholars from multiple disciplines to
provide a cross-domain perspective on the trends and challenges of AIGC.
Specifically, the contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) It first
provides a broader overview of AIGC, spanning the training techniques of
Generative AI, detection methods, and both the spread and use of AI-generated
content across digital platforms. (2) It then introduces the societal impacts
of AIGC across diverse domains, along with a review of existing methods
employed in these contexts. (3) Finally, it discusses the key technical
challenges and presents research propositions to guide future work. Through
these contributions, this vision paper seeks to offer readers a cross-domain
perspective on AIGC, providing insights into its current research trends,
ongoing challenges, and future directions.

Title: VideoAgent: Personalized Synthesis of Scientific Videos
Authors: Xiao Liang, Bangxin Li, Zixuan Chen, Hanyue Zheng, Zhi Ma, Di Wang,
  Cong Tian, Quan Wang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Automating the generation of scientific videos is a crucial yet challenging
task for effective knowledge dissemination. However, existing works on document
automation primarily focus on static media such as posters and slides, lacking
mechanisms for personalized dynamic orchestration and multimodal content
synchronization. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoAgent, a novel
multi-agent framework that synthesizes personalized scientific videos through a
conversational interface. VideoAgent parses a source paper into a fine-grained
asset library and, guided by user requirements, orchestrates a narrative flow
that synthesizes both static slides and dynamic animations to explain complex
concepts. To enable rigorous evaluation, we also propose SciVidEval, the first
comprehensive suite for this task, which combines automated metrics for
multimodal content quality and synchronization with a Video-Quiz-based human
evaluation to measure knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing commercial scientific video
generation services and approaches human-level quality in scientific
communication.

Title: Prompts to Proxies: Emulating Human Preferences via a Compact LLM
  Ensemble
Authors: Bingchen Wang, Zi-Yu Khoo, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low

Comments: Preprint of work originally submitted to AAAI 2026. Under revision

\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in emulating
human-like responses across a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel alignment framework that treats LLMs as agent proxies for human survey
respondents, affording a cost-effective and steerable solution to two pressing
challenges in the social sciences: the rising cost of survey deployment and the
growing demographic imbalance in survey response data. Drawing inspiration from
the theory of revealed preference, we formulate alignment as a two-stage
problem: constructing diverse agent personas called endowments that simulate
plausible respondent profiles, and selecting a representative subset to
approximate a ground-truth population based on observed data. To implement the
paradigm, we introduce P2P, a system that steers LLM agents toward
representative behavioral patterns using structured prompt engineering,
entropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection. Unlike
personalization-heavy approaches, our alignment approach is
demographic-agnostic and relies only on aggregate survey results, offering
better generalizability and parsimony. Beyond improving data efficiency in
social science research, our framework offers a testbed for studying the
operationalization of pluralistic alignment. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach on real-world opinion survey datasets, showing that our aligned agent
populations can reproduce aggregate response patterns with high fidelity and
exhibit substantial response diversity, even without demographic conditioning.

Title: Decoding Plastic Toxicity: An Intelligent Framework for Conflict-Aware
  Relational Metapath Extraction from Scientific Abstracts
Authors: Sudeshna Jana, Manjira Sinha and Tirthankar Dasgupta
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 11 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables
\\
  The widespread use of plastics and their persistence in the environment have
led to the accumulation of micro- and nano-plastics across air, water, and
soil, posing serious health risks including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and
neurological disorders. We propose a novel framework that leverages large
language models to extract relational metapaths, multi-hop semantic chains
linking pollutant sources to health impacts, from scientific abstracts. Our
system identifies and connects entities across diverse contexts to construct
structured relational metapaths, which are aggregated into a Toxicity
Trajectory Graph that traces pollutant propagation through exposure routes and
biological systems. Moreover, to ensure consistency and reliability, we
incorporate a dynamic evidence reconciliation module that resolves semantic
conflicts arising from evolving or contradictory research findings. Our
approach demonstrates strong performance in extracting reliable, high-utility
relational knowledge from noisy scientific text and offers a scalable solution
for mining complex cause-effect structures in domain-specific corpora.

Title: The power of dynamic causality in observer-based design for soft sensor
  applications
Authors: William Farlessyost and Sebastian Oberst and Shweta Singh
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  This paper introduces a novel framework for optimizing observer-based soft
sensors through dynamic causality analysis. Traditional approaches to sensor
selection often rely on linearized observability indices or statistical
correlations that fail to capture the temporal evolution of complex systems. We
address this gap by leveraging liquid-time constant (LTC) networks,
continuous-time neural architectures with input-dependent time constants, to
systematically identify and prune sensor inputs with minimal causal influence
on state estimation. Our methodology implements an iterative workflow: training
an LTC observer on candidate inputs, quantifying each input's causal impact
through controlled perturbation analysis, removing inputs with negligible
effect, and retraining until performance degradation occurs. We demonstrate
this approach on three mechanistic testbeds representing distinct physical
domains: a harmonically forced spring-mass-damper system, a nonlinear
continuous stirred-tank reactor, and a predator-prey model following the
structure of the Lotka-Volterra model, but with seasonal forcing and added
complexity. Results show that our causality-guided pruning consistently
identifies minimal sensor sets that align with underlying physics while
improving prediction accuracy. The framework automatically distinguishes
essential physical measurements from noise and determines when derived
interaction terms provide complementary versus redundant information. Beyond
computational efficiency, this approach enhances interpretability by grounding
sensor selection decisions in dynamic causal relationships rather than static
correlations, offering significant benefits for soft sensing applications
across process engineering, ecological monitoring, and agricultural domains.

  Optimization
Authors: Yichen Han, Bojun Liu, Zhengpeng zhou, Guanyu Liu, Zeng Zhang, Yang
  Yang, Wenli Wang, Isaac N Shi, Yunyan, Lewei He, Tianyu Shi
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging large language models (LLMs),
but existing methods often rely on a single optimization trajectory, limiting
adaptability and efficiency while suffering from narrow perspectives, gradient
conflicts, and high computational cost. We propose MAPGD (Multi-Agent Prompt
Gradient Descent), a framework integrating multi-agent collaboration with
gradient-based optimization. MAPGD features specialized agents for task
clarity, example selection, format design, and stylistic refinement; semantic
gradient coordination to resolve conflicts; bandit-based candidate selection
for efficient exploration-exploitation; and theoretical convergence guarantees.
Experiments on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks show MAPGD
outperforms single-agent and random baselines in accuracy and efficiency.
Ablations confirm the benefits of gradient fusion, agent specialization, and
conflict resolution, providing a unified, gradient-inspired multi-agent
approach to robust and interpretable prompt optimization.

Title: Securing AI Agents: Implementing Role-Based Access Control for
  Industrial Applications
Authors: Aadil Gani Ganie
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
solutions across various domains, from political science to software
development. However, these models are constrained by their training data,
which is static and limited to information available up to a specific date.
Additionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning --
whether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform
specific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate
some of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data,
enabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In
industrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing
decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example,
in manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost
productivity and support real-time decision-making. Despite these advancements,
AI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection
attacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for integrating
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents, providing a robust security
guardrail. This framework aims to support the effective and scalable deployment
of AI agents, with a focus on on-premises implementations.

Title: Knowledge-Guided Adaptive Mixture of Experts for Precipitation
  Prediction
Authors: Chen Jiang, Kofi Osei, Sai Deepthi Yeddula, Dongji Feng, Wei-Shinn Ku
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 13 pages
\\
  Accurate precipitation forecasting is indispensable in agriculture, disaster
management, and sustainable strategies. However, predicting rainfall has been
challenging due to the complexity of climate systems and the heterogeneous
nature of multi-source observational data, including radar, satellite imagery,
and surface-level measurements. The multi-source data vary in spatial and
temporal resolution, and they carry domain-specific features, making it
challenging for effective integration in conventional deep learning models.
Previous research has explored various machine learning techniques for weather
prediction; however, most struggle with the integration of data with
heterogeneous modalities. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive
Mixture of Experts (MoE) model tailored for precipitation rate prediction. Each
expert within the model specializes in a specific modality or spatio-temporal
pattern. We also incorporated a dynamic router that learns to assign inputs to
the most relevant experts. Our results show that this modular design enhances
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In addition to the modeling
framework, we introduced an interactive web-based visualization tool that
enables users to intuitively explore historical weather patterns over time and
space. The tool was designed to support decision-making for stakeholders in
climate-sensitive sectors. We evaluated our approach using a curated multimodal
climate dataset capturing real-world conditions during Hurricane Ian in 2022.
The benchmark results show that the Adaptive MoE significantly outperformed all
the baselines.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist
policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model
architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power
budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five
representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly
proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using
the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics,
including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power
constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results
identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action
tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory
footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance
degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter
GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant
accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and
optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges
current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic
inference.

Title: MedicalOS: An LLM Agent based Operating System for Digital Healthcare
Authors: Jared Zhu, Junde Wu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Decades' advances in digital health technologies, such as electronic health
records, have largely streamlined routine clinical processes. Yet, most these
systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of
managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating
complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on
administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large
language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding
and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with
operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing
agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an
abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language
into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a
more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical
guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and
compliance. To address this need, we present \textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified
agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract
layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital
healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam
management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped
as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP,
Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22
specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically
sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and
medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy
and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.

Title: Task Decoding based on Eye Movements using Synthetic Data Augmentation
Authors: Shanmuka Sadhu, Arca Baran, Preeti Pandey, and Ayush Kumar
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Machine learning has been extensively used in various applications related to
eye-tracking research. Understanding eye movement is one of the most
significant subsets of eye-tracking research that reveals the scanning pattern
of an individual. Researchers have thoroughly analyzed eye movement data to
understand various eye-tracking applications, such as attention mechanisms,
navigational behavior, task understanding, etc. The outcome of traditional
machine learning algorithms used for decoding tasks based on eye movement data
has received a mixed reaction to Yarbus' claim that it is possible to decode
the observer's task from their eye movements. In this paper, to support the
hypothesis by Yarbus, we are decoding tasks categories while generating
synthetic data samples using well-known Synthetic Data Generators CTGAN and its
variations such as CopulaGAN and Gretel AI Synthetic Data generators on
available data from an in-person user study. Our results show that augmenting
more eye movement data combined with additional synthetically generated
improves classification accuracy even with traditional machine learning
algorithms. We see a significant improvement in task decoding accuracy from
28.1% using Random Forest to 82% using Inception Time when five times more data
is added in addition to the 320 real eye movement dataset sample. Our proposed
framework outperforms all the available studies on this dataset because of the
use of additional synthetic datasets. We validated our claim with various
algorithms and combinations of real and synthetic data to show how decoding
accuracy increases with the increase in the augmentation of generated data to
real data.

  Reasoning is essential for closed-domain QA systems in which procedural
correctness and policy compliance are critical. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work
reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful - serving more as
plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to
combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved
reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with
dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional
transitions.
  In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a
neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support
property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal
specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation,
we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic
procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and
interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes
closed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its
performance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to
contextualize its effectiveness.

Comments: This paper is currently under review

  Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates
intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem
and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct
reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and
branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The
topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including
traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal
inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag
set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling,
tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment
regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each
topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along
with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and
deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey).
Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are
highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty,
grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and
treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning
structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against
computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely
depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop
testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and
long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from
narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only
analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable
evidence and credible outcomes.

  Anti-money laundering (AML) research is constrained by the lack of publicly
shareable, regulation-aligned transaction datasets. We present AMLNet, a
knowledge-based multi-agent framework with two coordinated units: a
regulation-aware transaction generator and an ensemble detection pipeline. The
generator produces 1,090,173 synthetic transactions (approximately 0.16\%
laundering-positive) spanning core laundering phases (placement, layering,
integration) and advanced typologies (e.g., structuring, adaptive threshold
behavior). Regulatory alignment reaches 75\% based on AUSTRAC rule coverage
(Section 4.2), while a composite technical fidelity score of 0.75 summarizes
temporal, structural, and behavioral realism components (Section 4.4). The
detection ensemble achieves F1 0.90 (precision 0.84, recall 0.97) on the
internal test partitions of AMLNet and adapts to the external SynthAML dataset,
indicating architectural generalizability across different synthetic generation
paradigms. We provide multi-dimensional evaluation (regulatory, temporal,

Comments: Accepted by MICCAI 2025 MLLMCP Workshop
\\
  This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS)
self-management. We constructed a database of approximately 3,000
anteroposterior X-rays with diagnostic texts and evaluated five MLLMs through a
`Divide and Conquer' framework consisting of a visual question-answering task,
a domain knowledge assessment task, and a patient education counseling
assessment task. Our investigation revealed limitations of MLLMs' ability in
interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge.
To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting
and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG),
respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across
different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances
on the knowledge assessment task. Our findings indicate current MLLMs are far
from capable in realizing personalized assistant in AIS care. The greatest
challenge lies in their abilities to obtain accurate detections of spinal
deformity locations (best accuracy: 0.55) and directions (best accuracy: 0.13).

Title: HeLoFusion: An Efficient and Scalable Encoder for Modeling Heterogeneous
  and Multi-Scale Interactions in Trajectory Prediction
Authors: Bingqing Wei, Lianmin Chen, Zhongyu Xia, Yongtao Wang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Multi-agent trajectory prediction in autonomous driving requires a
comprehensive understanding of complex social dynamics. Existing methods,
however, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics,
particularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse
behaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling
heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global
context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each
agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and
complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or
pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of
agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme
and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced,
type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a
principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and
expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for
key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a
locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and
heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion
forecasting.

  This paper introduces a novel application of Supervised Contrastive Learning
(SupCon) to Imitation Learning (IL), with a focus on learning more effective
state representations for agents in video game environments. The goal is to
obtain latent representations of the observations that capture better the
action-relevant factors, thereby modeling better the cause-effect relationship
from the observations that are mapped to the actions performed by the
demonstrator, for example, the player jumps whenever an obstacle appears ahead.
We propose an approach to integrate the SupCon loss with continuous output
spaces, enabling SupCon to operate without constraints regarding the type of
actions of the environment. Experiments on the 3D games Astro Bot and Returnal,
and multiple 2D Atari games show improved representation quality, faster
learning convergence, and better generalization compared to baseline models
trained only with supervised action prediction loss functions.

Title: EgoMem: Lifelong Memory Agent for Full-duplex Omnimodal Models
Authors: Yiqun Yao, Naitong Yu, Xiang Li, Xin Jiang, Xuezhi Fang, Wenjia Ma,

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  We introduce EgoMem, the first lifelong memory agent tailored for full-duplex
models that process real-time omnimodal streams. EgoMem enables real-time
models to recognize multiple users directly from raw audiovisual streams, to
provide personalized response, and to maintain long-term knowledge of users'
facts, preferences, and social relationships extracted from audiovisual
history. EgoMem operates with three asynchronous processes: (i) a retrieval
process that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers
relevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that
generates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and
(iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries
from omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the
long-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies
entirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for
lifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
that EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy
on the test set. When integrated with a fine-tuned RoboEgo omnimodal chatbot,
the system achieves fact-consistency scores above 87% in real-time personalized
dialogs, establishing a strong baseline for future research.

Title: BuildingGym: An open-source toolbox for AI-based building energy
  management using reinforcement learning
Authors: Xilei Dai, Ruotian Chen, Songze Guan, Wen-Tai Li, Chau Yuen
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for AI-based building energy
management. However, there is a lack of flexible framework to implement RL
across various control problems in building energy management. To address this
gap, we propose BuildingGym, an open-source tool designed as a
research-friendly and flexible framework for training RL control strategies for
common challenges in building energy management. BuildingGym integrates
EnergyPlus as its core simulator, making it suitable for both system-level and
room-level control. Additionally, BuildingGym is able to accept external
signals as control inputs instead of taking the building as a stand-alone
entity. This feature makes BuildingGym applicable for more flexible
environments, e.g. smart grid and EVs community. The tool provides several
built-in RL algorithms for control strategy training, simplifying the process
for building managers to obtain optimal control strategies. Users can achieve
this by following a few straightforward steps to configure BuildingGym for
optimization control for common problems in the building energy management
field. Moreover, AI specialists can easily implement and test state-of-the-art
control algorithms within the platform. BuildingGym bridges the gap between
building managers and AI specialists by allowing for the easy configuration and
replacement of RL algorithms, simulators, and control environments or problems.
With BuildingGym, we efficiently set up training tasks for cooling load
management, targeting both constant and dynamic cooling load management. The
built-in algorithms demonstrated strong performance across both tasks,
highlighting the effectiveness of BuildingGym in optimizing cooling strategies.

Title: Neuromorphic Intelligence
Authors: Marcel van Gerven
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 18 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency,
flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike
conventional digital approaches, which depend on massive computational and
energy resources, neuromorphic systems exploit brain-inspired principles of
computation to achieve orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. By
drawing on insights from artificial intelligence, neuroscience, physics,
chemistry, and materials science, neuromorphic computing promises to deliver
intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and widely accessible. A
central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying theoretical framework
capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue that dynamical systems
theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in differential calculus, it offers a
principled language for modeling inference, learning, and control in both
natural and artificial substrates. Within this framework, noise can be
harnessed as a resource for learning, while differential genetic programming
enables the discovery of dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors.
Embracing this perspective paves the way toward emergent neuromorphic
intelligence, where intel- ligent behavior arises from the dynamics of physical
substrates, advancing both the science and sustainability of AI.

  The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostic
workflows requires robust and consistent evaluation methods to ensure
reliability, clinical relevance, and the inherent variability in expert
judgments. Traditional metrics like precision and recall often fail to account
for the inherent variability in expert judgments, leading to inconsistent
assessments of AI performance. Inter-rater agreement statistics like Cohen's
Kappa are more reliable but they lack interpretability. We introduce Relative
Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) - a new
evaluation metrics that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions
rather than a single reference. By normalizing performance against inter-expert
disagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the
quality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of
diagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result.
Our evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a
limited list when evaluating a given case. Instead, both the models being
tested and the examiners verifying them arrive at a free-form diagnosis. In
this automated methodology for establishing the identity of free-form clinical
diagnoses, a remarkable 98% accuracy becomes attainable. We evaluate our
approach using 360 medical dialogues, comparing multiple large language models
(LLMs) against a panel of physicians. Large-scale study shows that
top-performing models, such as DeepSeek-V3, achieve consistency on par with or
exceeding expert consensus. Moreover, we demonstrate that expert judgments
exhibit significant variability - often greater than that between AI and
humans. This finding underscores the limitations of any absolute metrics and
supports the need to adopt relative metrics in medical AI.

Title: Neuro-Symbolic Agents with Modal Logic for Autonomous Diagnostics
Authors: Antonin Sulc, Thorsten Hellert
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO cs.MA
Comments: 10 pages, 1 figure, Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA) Workshop at
  NeuralIPS
\\
  The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language
models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require
intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing
grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit
very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous
capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets
has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the
structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these
environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This
paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief
states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This
foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of
\emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal
logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make
infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for
proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively
guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from
reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity
simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses
complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs
with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world
model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable
autonomous agents.

Title: Agentic Temporal Graph of Reasoning with Multimodal Language Models: A
  Potential AI Aid to Healthcare
Authors: Susanta Mitra
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal
data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal
reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific
domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall
short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of
multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare
professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through
a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in
accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the
reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the
best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at
different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and
disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning
framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to
further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and
analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed
preliminary approach.

Title: MusicSwarm: Biologically Inspired Intelligence for Music Composition
Authors: Markus J. Buehler
Categories: cs.AI cs.MM cs.SD
\\
  We show that coherent, long-form musical composition can emerge from a
decentralized swarm of identical, frozen foundation models that coordinate via
stigmergic, peer-to-peer signals, without any weight updates. We compare a
centralized multi-agent system with a global critic to a fully decentralized
swarm in which bar-wise agents sense and deposit harmonic, rhythmic, and
structural cues, adapt short-term memory, and reach consensus. Across symbolic,
audio, and graph-theoretic analyses, the swarm yields superior quality while
delivering greater diversity and structural variety and leads across creativity
metrics. The dynamics contract toward a stable configuration of complementary
roles, and self-similarity networks reveal a small-world architecture with
efficient long-range connectivity and specialized bridging motifs, clarifying
how local novelties consolidate into global musical form. By shifting
specialization from parameter updates to interaction rules, shared memory, and
dynamic consensus, MusicSwarm provides a compute- and data-efficient route to
long-horizon creative structure that is immediately transferable beyond music
to collaborative writing, design, and scientific discovery.

Title: Human-AI Use Patterns for Decision-Making in Disaster Scenarios: A
  Systematic Review
Authors: Emmanuel Adjei Domfeh and Christopher L. Dancy
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures
\\
  In high-stakes disaster scenarios, timely and informed decision-making is
critical yet often challenged by uncertainty, dynamic environments, and limited
resources. This paper presents a systematic review of Human-AI collaboration
patterns that support decision-making across all disaster management phases.
Drawing from 51 peer-reviewed studies, we identify four major categories:
Human-AI Decision Support Systems, Task and Resource Coordination, Trust and
Transparency, and Simulation and Training. Within these, we analyze
sub-patterns such as cognitive-augmented intelligence, multi-agent
coordination, explainable AI, and virtual training environments. Our review
highlights how AI systems may enhance situational awareness, improves response
efficiency, and support complex decision-making, while also surfacing critical
limitations in scalability, interpretability, and system interoperability. We
conclude by outlining key challenges and future research directions,
emphasizing the need for adaptive, trustworthy, and context-aware Human-AI
systems to improve disaster resilience and equitable recovery outcomes.

Title: When Safe Unimodal Inputs Collide: Optimizing Reasoning Chains for
  Cross-Modal Safety in Multimodal Large Language Models
Authors: Wei Cai, Shujuan Liu, Jian Zhao, Ziyan Shi, Yusheng Zhao, Yuchen Yuan,
  Tianle Zhang, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit
reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into
risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this
vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through
long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce
Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring
interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A
novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is
also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning
process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our
SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks,
including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly
outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.

Title: Bridging Engineering and AI Planning through Model-Based Knowledge
  Transformation for the Validation of Automated Production System Variants
Authors: Hamied Nabizada, Lasse Beers, Alain Chahine, Felix Gehlhoff, Oliver
  Niggemann, Alexander Fay
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Presented at the KEPS-Workshop, ICAPS 2025
\\
  Engineering models created in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
environments contain detailed information about system structure and behavior.
However, they typically lack symbolic planning semantics such as preconditions,
effects, and constraints related to resource availability and timing. This
limits their ability to evaluate whether a given system variant can fulfill
specific tasks and how efficiently it performs compared to alternatives.
  To address this gap, this paper presents a model-driven method that enables
the specification and automated generation of symbolic planning artifacts
within SysML-based engineering models. A dedicated SysML profile introduces
reusable stereotypes for core planning constructs. These are integrated into
existing model structures and processed by an algorithm that generates a valid
domain file and a corresponding problem file in Planning Domain Definition
Language (PDDL). In contrast to previous approaches that rely on manual
transformations or external capability models, the method supports native
integration and maintains consistency between engineering and planning
artifacts.
  The applicability of the method is demonstrated through a case study from
aircraft assembly. The example illustrates how existing engineering models are
enriched with planning semantics and how the proposed workflow is applied to
generate consistent planning artifacts from these models. The generated
planning artifacts enable the validation of system variants through AI
planning.

\\
  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into legal practice raises
pressing concerns about judicial fairness, particularly due to the nature of
their "black-box" processes. This study introduces JustEva, a comprehensive,
open-source evaluation toolkit designed to measure LLM fairness in legal tasks.
JustEva features several advantages: (1) a structured label system covering 65
extra-legal factors; (2) three core fairness metrics - inconsistency, bias, and
imbalanced inaccuracy; (3) robust statistical inference methods; and (4)
informative visualizations. The toolkit supports two types of experiments,
enabling a complete evaluation workflow: (1) generating structured outputs from
LLMs using a provided dataset, and (2) conducting statistical analysis and
inference on LLMs' outputs through regression and other statistical methods.
Empirical application of JustEva reveals significant fairness deficiencies in
current LLMs, highlighting the lack of fair and trustworthy LLM legal tools.
JustEva offers a convenient tool and methodological foundation for evaluating
and improving algorithmic fairness in the legal domain.

Title: Co-Alignment: Rethinking Alignment as Bidirectional Human-AI Cognitive
  Adaptation
Authors: Yubo Li, Weiyi Song
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA
\\
  Current AI alignment through RLHF follows a single directional paradigm that
AI conforms to human preferences while treating human cognition as fixed. We
propose a shift to co-alignment through Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment
(BiCA), where humans and AI mutually adapt. BiCA uses learnable protocols,
representation mapping, and KL-budget constraints for controlled co-evolution.
In collaborative navigation, BiCA achieved 85.5% success versus 70.3% baseline,
with 230% better mutual adaptation and 332% better protocol convergence.
Emergent protocols outperformed handcrafted ones by 84%, while bidirectional
adaptation unexpectedly improved safety (+23% out-of-distribution robustness).
The 46% synergy improvement demonstrates optimal collaboration exists at the
intersection, not union, of human and AI capabilities, validating the shift
from single-directional to co-alignment paradigms.

  BACKGROUND: For over a century, the New England Journal of Medicine
Clinicopathological Conferences (CPCs) have tested the reasoning of expert
physicians and, recently, artificial intelligence (AI). However, prior AI
evaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted
reasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.
  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),
we conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create
CPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and
multimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models
(LLMs). Then, we developed "Dr. CaBot," an AI discussant designed to produce
written and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,
modeling the role of the human expert in these cases.
  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the
final diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,
outperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached
98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per
unit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image
tasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image
challenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,
physicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of
trials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote
research, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.
  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based
differential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,
but image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and
CaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI.

Title: Uncovering the Vulnerability of Large Language Models in the Financial

Authors: Gang Cheng, Haibo Jin, Wenbin Zhang, Haohan Wang, Jun Zhuang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Preprint, under review. TL;DR: We propose a multi-turn red-teaming
  framework, RCA, that reveals critical regulatory vulnerabilities in financial
  LLMs, achieving over 93% attack success on a proposed new benchmark,
  FIN-Bench
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial
applications, yet existing red-teaming research primarily targets harmful
content, largely neglecting regulatory risks. In this work, we aim to
investigate the vulnerability of financial LLMs through red-teaming approaches.
We introduce Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA), a novel multi-turn framework that
iteratively conceals regulatory risks to provoke seemingly compliant yet
regulatory-violating responses from LLMs. To enable systematic evaluation, we
construct FIN-Bench, a domain-specific benchmark for assessing LLM safety in
financial contexts. Extensive experiments on FIN-Bench demonstrate that RCA
effectively bypasses nine mainstream LLMs, achieving an average attack success
rate (ASR) of 93.18%, including 98.28% on GPT-4.1 and 97.56% on OpenAI o1.
These findings reveal a critical gap in current alignment techniques and
underscore the urgent need for stronger moderation mechanisms in financial
domains. We hope this work offers practical insights for advancing robust and
domain-aware LLM alignment.

  Linear Probes

  Gonzalvez Hawthorne, David Demitri Africa, Lorenzo Pacchiardi
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Do large language models (LLMs) anticipate when they will answer correctly?
To study this, we extract activations after a question is read but before any
tokens are generated, and train linear probes to predict whether the model's
forthcoming answer will be correct. Across three open-source model families
ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters, projections on this "in-advance
correctness direction" trained on generic trivia questions predict success in
distribution and on diverse out-of-distribution knowledge datasets,
outperforming black-box baselines and verbalised predicted confidence.
Predictive power saturates in intermediate layers, suggesting that
self-assessment emerges mid-computation. Notably, generalisation falters on
questions requiring mathematical reasoning. Moreover, for models responding "I
don't know", doing so strongly correlates with the probe score, indicating that
the same direction also captures confidence. By complementing previous results
on truthfulness and other behaviours obtained with probes and sparse
auto-encoders, our work contributes essential findings to elucidate LLM
internals.

Title: Interdisciplinary Research in Conversation: A Case Study in
  Computational Morphology for Language Documentation
Authors: Enora Rice, Katharina von der Wense and Alexis Palmer
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025
\\
  Computational morphology has the potential to support language documentation
through tasks like morphological segmentation and the generation of Interlinear
Glossed Text (IGT). However, our research outputs have seen limited use in
real-world language documentation settings. This position paper situates the
disconnect between computational morphology and language documentation within a
broader misalignment between research and practice in NLP and argues that the
field risks becoming decontextualized and ineffectual without systematic
integration of User-Centered Design (UCD). To demonstrate how principles from
UCD can reshape the research agenda, we present a case study of GlossLM, a
state-of-the-art multilingual IGT generation model. Through a small-scale user
study with three documentary linguists, we find that despite strong metric
based performance, the system fails to meet core usability needs in real
documentation contexts. These insights raise new research questions around
model constraints, label standardization, segmentation, and personalization. We
argue that centering users not only produces more effective tools, but surfaces
richer, more relevant research directions

Authors: Zineddine Tighidet, Andrea Mogini, Hedi Ben-younes, Jiali Mei, Patrick
  Gallinari, Benjamin Piwowarski
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted at EMNLP 2025
\\
  The behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when facing contextual
information that conflicts with their internal parametric knowledge is
inconsistent, with no generally accepted explanation for the expected outcome
distribution. Recent work has identified in autoregressive transformer models a
class of neurons -- called entropy neurons -- that produce a significant effect
on the model output entropy while having an overall moderate impact on the
ranking of the predicted tokens. In this paper, we investigate the preliminary
claim that these neurons are involved in inhibiting context copying behavior in
transformers by looking at their role in resolving conflicts between contextual
and parametric information. We show that entropy neurons are responsible for
suppressing context copying across a range of LLMs, and that ablating them
leads to a significant change in the generation process. These results enhance
our understanding of the internal dynamics of LLMs when handling conflicting
information.

Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main Proceedings)
\\
  As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such
as healthcare, ensuring their outputs reflect the diverse values and
perspectives held across populations is critical. However, existing alignment
approaches, including pluralistic paradigms like Modular Pluralism, often fall
short in the health domain, where personal, cultural, and situational factors
shape pluralism. Motivated by the aforementioned healthcare challenges, we
propose a first lightweight, generalizable, pluralistic alignment approach,
EthosAgents, designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values. We
empirically show that it advances the pluralistic alignment for all three modes
across seven varying-sized open and closed models. Our findings reveal that
health-related pluralism demands adaptable and normatively aware approaches,
offering insights into how these models can better respect diversity in other
high-stakes domains.

  Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation is a promising
technique for utilizing private datasets that otherwise cannot be exposed for
model training or other analytics. While much research literature has focused
on generating private unstructured text and image data, in enterprise settings,
structured data (e.g., tabular) is more common, often including natural
language fields or components. Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques
(e.g., FID) struggle to capture the structural properties and correlations of
such datasets. In this work, we propose Struct-Bench, a framework and benchmark
for evaluating synthetic datasets derived from structured datasets that contain
natural language data. The Struct-Bench framework requires users to provide a
representation of their dataset structure as a Context-Free Grammar (CFG). Our
benchmark comprises 5 real-world and 2 synthetically generated datasets, each
annotated with CFGs. We show that these datasets demonstrably present a great
challenge even for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods.
Struct-Bench also includes reference implementations of different metrics and a
leaderboard, thereby providing researchers a standardized evaluation platform
to benchmark and investigate privacy-preserving synthetic data generation
methods. Further, we also present a case study showing how to use Struct-Bench
to improve the synthetic data quality of Private Evolution (PE) on structured
data. The benchmark and the leaderboard have been publicly made available at
https://struct-bench.github.io.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their remarkable capabilities in text generation and reasoning. However,
these models face critical challenges when deployed in real-world applications,
including hallucination generation, outdated knowledge, and limited domain
expertise. Retrieval And Structuring (RAS) Augmented Generation addresses these
limitations by integrating dynamic information retrieval with structured
knowledge representations. This survey (1) examines retrieval mechanisms
including sparse, dense, and hybrid approaches for accessing external
knowledge; (2) explore text structuring techniques such as taxonomy
construction, hierarchical classification, and information extraction that
transform unstructured text into organized representations; and (3) investigate
how these structured representations integrate with LLMs through prompt-based
methods, reasoning frameworks, and knowledge embedding techniques. It also
identifies technical challenges in retrieval efficiency, structure quality, and
knowledge integration, while highlighting research opportunities in multimodal
retrieval, cross-lingual structures, and interactive systems. This
comprehensive overview provides researchers and practitioners with insights
into RAS methods, applications, and future directions.

Title: SearchInstruct: Enhancing Domain Adaptation via Retrieval-Based
  Instruction Dataset Creation
Authors: Iman Barati, Mostafa Amiri, Heshaam Faili
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is essential for training large language models
(LLMs), significantly enhancing critical capabilities such as instruction
following and in-context learning. Nevertheless, creating suitable training
datasets tailored for specific domains remains challenging due to unique domain
constraints and data scarcity. In this paper, we propose SearchInstruct, an
innovative method explicitly designed to construct high quality instruction
datasets for SFT. Our approach begins with a limited set of domain specific,
human generated questions, which are systematically expanded using a large
language model. Subsequently, domain relevant resources are dynamically
retrieved to generate accurate and contextually appropriate answers for each
augmented question. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SearchInstruct
enhances both the diversity and quality of SFT datasets, leading to measurable
improvements in LLM performance within specialized domains. Additionally, we
show that beyond dataset generation, the proposed method can also effectively
facilitate tasks such as model editing, enabling efficient updates to existing
models. To facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we provide full
implementation details, the complete set of generated instruction response
pairs, and the source code in a publicly accessible Git repository:

  Disinformation spreads rapidly across linguistic boundaries, yet most AI
models are still benchmarked only on English. We address this gap with a
systematic comparison of five multilingual transformer models: mBERT, XLM,
XLM-RoBERTa, RemBERT, and mT5 on a common fake-vs-true machine learning
classification task. While transformer-based language models have demonstrated
notable success in detecting disinformation in English, their effectiveness in
multilingual contexts still remains up for debate. To facilitate evaluation, we
introduce PolyTruth Disinfo Corpus, a novel corpus of 60,486 statement pairs
(false claim vs. factual correction) spanning over twenty five languages that
collectively cover five language families and a broad topical range from
politics, health, climate, finance, and conspiracy, half of which are
fact-checked disinformation claims verified by an augmented MindBugs Discovery
dataset. Our experiments revealed performance variations. Models such as
RemBERT achieved better overall accuracy, particularly excelling in
low-resource languages, whereas models like mBERT and XLM exhibit considerable
limitations when training data is scarce. We provide a discussion of these
performance patterns and implications for real-world deployment. The dataset is
publicly available on our GitHub repository to encourage further
experimentation and advancement. Our findings illuminate both the potential and
the current limitations of AI systems for multilingual disinformation
detection.

  Despite widespread success in language understanding and generation, large
language models (LLMs) exhibit unclear and often inconsistent behavior when
faced with tasks that require probabilistic reasoning. In this work, we present
the first comprehensive study of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs over
explicit discrete probability distributions. Given observations from a
probability distribution, we evaluate models on three carefully designed tasks,
mode identification, maximum likelihood estimation, and sample generation, by
prompting them to provide responses to queries about either the joint
distribution or its conditionals. These tasks thus probe a range of
probabilistic skills, including frequency analysis, marginalization, and
generative behavior. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations, we
demonstrate that there exists a clear performance gap between smaller and
larger models, with the latter demonstrating stronger inference and surprising
capabilities in sample generation. Furthermore, our investigations reveal
notable limitations, including sensitivity to variations in the notation
utilized to represent probabilistic outcomes and performance degradation of
over 60% as context length increases. Together, our results provide a detailed
understanding of the probabilistic reasoning abilities of LLMs and identify key
directions for future improvement.

  As scientific knowledge grows at an unprecedented pace, evaluation benchmarks
must evolve to reflect new discoveries and ensure language models are tested on
current, diverse literature. We propose a scalable, modular framework for
generating multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) benchmarks directly from
large corpora of scientific papers. Our pipeline automates every stage of MCQA
creation, including PDF parsing, semantic chunking, question generation, and
model evaluation. As a case study, we generate more than 16,000 MCQs from
22,000 open-access articles in radiation and cancer biology. We then evaluate a
suite of small language models (1.1B-14B parameters) on these questions,
comparing baseline accuracy with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from
paper-derived semantic chunks and from reasoning traces distilled from GPT-4.1.
We find that reasoning-trace retrieval consistently improves performance on
both synthetic and expert-annotated benchmarks, enabling several small models
to surpass GPT-4 on the 2023 Astro Radiation and Cancer Biology exam.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large language models in healthcare often miss critical emotional cues,
delivering medically sound but emotionally flat advice. This is especially
problematic in clinical contexts where patients are distressed and vulnerable,
and require empathic communication to support safety, adherence, and trust. We
present RECAP (Reflect-Extract-Calibrate-Align-Produce), an inference-time
framework that adds structured emotional reasoning without retraining. By
decomposing empathy into transparent appraisal-theoretic stages and exposing
per-dimension Likert signals, RECAP produces nuanced, auditable responses.
Across EmoBench, SECEU, and EQ-Bench, RECAP improves emotional reasoning by
22-28% on 8B models and 10-13% on larger models over zero-shot baselines.
Clinician evaluations further confirm superior empathetic communication. RECAP
shows that modular, theory-grounded prompting can systematically enhance
emotional intelligence in medical AI while preserving the accountability
required for deployment.

Title: Judge Q: Trainable Queries for Optimized Information Retention in KV
  Cache Eviction
Authors: Yijun Liu, Yixuan Wang, Yuzhuang Xu, Shiyu Ji, Yang Xu, Qingfu Zhu,
  Wanxiang Che
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: preprint
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) utilize key-value (KV) cache to store historical
information during sequence processing. The size of KV cache grows linearly as
the length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and
decoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize
the last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV
importance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it
tends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect
or omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Judge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This
method only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By
concatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train
these tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that
of the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the
soft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the
importance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining
decoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our
method exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction
approaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models
such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks
including LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an
improvement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on
RULER. This proposed methodology can be seamlessly integrated into existing
open-source models with minimal training overhead, thereby enhancing
performance in KV cache eviction scenarios.

Title: Towards Automated Error Discovery: A Study in Conversational AI
Authors: Dominic Petrak, Thy Thy Tran, Iryna Gurevych
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 main conference
\\
  Although LLM-based conversational agents demonstrate strong fluency and
coherence, they still produce undesirable behaviors (errors) that are
challenging to prevent from reaching users during deployment. Recent research
leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect errors and guide
response-generation models toward improvement. However, current LLMs struggle
to identify errors not explicitly specified in their instructions, such as
those arising from updates to the response-generation model or shifts in user
behavior. In this work, we introduce Automated Error Discovery, a framework for
detecting and defining errors in conversational AI, and propose SEEED (Soft
Clustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection), as an encoder-based
approach to its implementation. We enhance the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss by
amplifying distance weighting for negative samples and introduce Label-Based
Sample Ranking to select highly contrastive examples for better representation
learning. SEEED outperforms adapted baselines -- including GPT-4o and Phi-4 --
across multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving the accuracy for
detecting unknown errors by up to 8 points and demonstrating strong
generalization to unknown intent detection.

Title: Evaluating Large Language Models for Evidence-Based Clinical Question
  Answering
Authors: Can Wang, Yiqun Chen
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress in
biomedical and clinical applications, motivating rigorous evaluation of their
ability to answer nuanced, evidence-based questions. We curate a multi-source
benchmark drawing from Cochrane systematic reviews and clinical guidelines,
including structured recommendations from the American Heart Association and
narrative guidance used by insurers. Using GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5, we observe
consistent performance patterns across sources and clinical domains: accuracy
is highest on structured guideline recommendations (90%) and lower on narrative
guideline and systematic review questions (60--70%). We also find a strong
correlation between accuracy and the citation count of the underlying
systematic reviews, where each doubling of citations is associated with roughly
a 30% increase in the odds of a correct answer. Models show moderate ability to
reason about evidence quality when contextual information is supplied. When we
incorporate retrieval-augmented prompting, providing the gold-source abstract
raises accuracy on previously incorrect items to 0.79; providing top 3 PubMed
abstracts (ranked by semantic relevance) improves accuracy to 0.23, while
random abstracts reduce accuracy (0.10, within temperature variation). These
effects are mirrored in GPT-4o-mini, underscoring that source clarity and
targeted retrieval -- not just model size -- drive performance. Overall, our
results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for
evidence-based clinical question answering. Retrieval-augmented prompting
emerges as a useful strategy to improve factual accuracy and alignment with
source evidence, while stratified evaluation by specialty and question type
remains essential to understand current knowledge access and to contextualize
model performance.

Title: GAPrune: Gradient-Alignment Pruning for Domain-Aware Embeddings
Authors: Yixuan Tang, Yi Yang
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: https://github.com/yixuantt/GAPrune
\\
  Domain-specific embedding models have shown promise for applications that
require specialized semantic understanding, such as coding agents and financial
retrieval systems, often achieving higher performance gains than general
models. However, state-of-the-art embedding models are typically based on LLMs,
which contain billions of parameters, making deployment challenging in
resource-constrained environments. Model compression through pruning offers a
promising solution, but existing pruning methods treat all parameters
uniformly, failing to distinguish between general semantic representations and
domain-specific patterns, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions. Thus, we
propose GAPrune, a pruning framework that addresses this challenge by
considering both domain importance and preserving general linguistic
foundation. Our method uses Fisher Information to measure importance and
general-domain gradient alignment to assess parameter behavior, then combines
these signals using our Domain Alignment Importance (DAI) scoring. Lower DAI
scores indicate that the parameter is either less important for the domain task
or creates conflicts between domain and general objectives. Experiments on two
domain benchmarks, FinMTEB and ChemTEB, show that GAPrune maintains performance
within 2.5% of dense models in one-shot pruning at 50% sparsity, while
outperforming all baselines. With retraining in 100 steps, GAPrune achieves
+4.51% improvement on FinMTEB and +1.73% on ChemTEB, demonstrating that our
pruning strategy not only preserves but enhances domain-specific capabilities.
Our findings demonstrate that principled pruning strategies can achieve model
compression and enhanced domain specialization, providing the research
community with a new approach for development.

Title: Text2Sign Diffusion: A Generative Approach for Gloss-Free Sign Language
  Production
Authors: Liqian Feng, Lintao Wang, Kun Hu, Dehui Kong, Zhiyong Wang
Categories: cs.CL cs.MM
\\
  Sign language production (SLP) aims to translate spoken language sentences
into a sequence of pose frames in a sign language, bridging the communication
gap and promoting digital inclusion for deaf and hard-of-hearing communities.
Existing methods typically rely on gloss, a symbolic representation of sign
language words or phrases that serves as an intermediate step in SLP. This
limits the flexibility and generalization of SLP, as gloss annotations are
often unavailable and language-specific. Therefore, we present a novel
diffusion-based generative approach - Text2Sign Diffusion (Text2SignDiff) for
gloss-free SLP. Specifically, a gloss-free latent diffusion model is proposed
to generate sign language sequences from noisy latent sign codes and spoken
text jointly, reducing the potential error accumulation through a
non-autoregressive iterative denoising process. We also design a cross-modal
signing aligner that learns a shared latent space to bridge visual and textual
content in sign and spoken languages. This alignment supports the conditioned
diffusion-based process, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant sign
language generation without gloss. Extensive experiments on the commonly used
PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

Title: A funny companion: Distinct neural responses to perceived AI- versus
  humangenerated humor
Authors: Xiaohui Rao, Hanlin Wu, Zhenguang G. Cai
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  As AI companions become capable of human-like communication, including
telling jokes, understanding how people cognitively and emotionally respond to
AI humor becomes increasingly important. This study used electroencephalography
(EEG) to compare how people process humor from AI versus human sources.
Behavioral analysis revealed that participants rated AI and human humor as
comparably funny. However, neurophysiological data showed that AI humor
elicited a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced cognitive effort during the
processing of incongruity. This was accompanied by a larger Late Positive
Potential (LPP), indicating a greater degree of surprise and emotional
response. This enhanced LPP likely stems from the violation of low initial
expectations regarding AI's comedic capabilities. Furthermore, a key temporal
dynamic emerged: human humor showed habituation effects, marked by an
increasing N400 and a decreasing LPP over time. In contrast, AI humor
demonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a
decreasing N400 and an increasing LPP. This trajectory reveals how the brain
can dynamically update its predictive model of AI capabilities. This process of
cumulative reinforcement challenges "algorithm aversion" in humor, as it
demonstrates how cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to an
intensified emotional reward. Additionally, participants' social attitudes
toward AI modulated these neural responses, with higher perceived AI
trustworthiness correlating with enhanced emotional engagement. These findings
indicate that the brain responds to AI humor with surprisingly positive and
intense reactions, highlighting humor's potential for fostering genuine
engagement in human-AI social interaction.

Comments: Accepted by EMNLP 2025 (Findings)
\\
  Effective long-term memory in conversational AI requires synthesizing
information across multiple sessions. However, current systems place excessive
reasoning burden on response generation, making performance significantly
dependent on model sizes. We introduce PREMem (Pre-storage Reasoning for
Episodic Memory), a novel approach that shifts complex reasoning processes from
inference to memory construction. PREMem extracts fine-grained memory fragments
categorized into factual, experiential, and subjective information; it then
establishes explicit relationships between memory items across sessions,
capturing evolution patterns like extensions, transformations, and
implications. By performing this reasoning during pre-storage rather than when
generating a response, PREMem creates enriched representations while reducing
computational demands during interactions. Experiments show significant
performance improvements across all model sizes, with smaller models achieving
results comparable to much larger baselines while maintaining effectiveness
even with constrained token budgets. Code and dataset are available at

Title: Quantifier Scope Interpretation in Language Learners and LLMs
Authors: Shaohua Fang, Yue Li, Yan Cong
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Sentences with multiple quantifiers often lead to interpretive ambiguities,
which can vary across languages. This study adopts a cross-linguistic approach
to examine how large language models (LLMs) handle quantifier scope
interpretation in English and Chinese, using probabilities to assess
interpretive likelihood. Human similarity (HS) scores were used to quantify the
extent to which LLMs emulate human performance across language groups. Results
reveal that most LLMs prefer the surface scope interpretations, aligning with
human tendencies, while only some differentiate between English and Chinese in
the inverse scope preferences, reflecting human-similar patterns. HS scores
highlight variability in LLMs' approximation of human behavior, but their
overall potential to align with humans is notable. Differences in model
architecture, scale, and particularly models' pre-training data language
background, significantly influence how closely LLMs approximate human
quantifier scope interpretations.

  Training data is fundamental to the success of modern machine learning
models, yet in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, the use of real-world
training data is severely constrained by concerns over privacy leakage. A
promising solution to this challenge is the use of differentially private (DP)
synthetic data, which offers formal privacy guarantees while maintaining data
utility. However, striking the right balance between privacy protection and
utility remains challenging in clinical note synthesis, given its domain
specificity and the complexity of long-form text generation. In this paper, we
present Term2Note, a methodology to synthesise long clinical notes under strong
DP constraints. By structurally separating content and form, Term2Note
generates section-wise note content conditioned on DP medical terms, with each
governed by separate DP constraints. A DP quality maximiser further enhances
synthetic notes by selecting high-quality outputs. Experimental results show
that Term2Note produces synthetic notes with statistical properties closely
aligned with real clinical notes, demonstrating strong fidelity. In addition,
multi-label classification models trained on these synthetic notes perform
comparably to those trained on real data, confirming their high utility.
Compared to existing DP text generation baselines, Term2Note achieves
substantial improvements in both fidelity and utility while operating under
fewer assumptions, suggesting its potential as a viable privacy-preserving
alternative to using sensitive clinical notes.

  Cultural competence, defined as the ability to understand and adapt to
multicultural contexts, is increasingly vital for large language models (LLMs)
in global environments. While several cultural benchmarks exist to assess LLMs'
cultural competence, current evaluations suffer from fragmented taxonomies,
domain specificity, and heavy reliance on manual data annotation. To address
these limitations, we introduce CultureSynth, a novel framework comprising (1)
a comprehensive hierarchical multilingual cultural taxonomy covering 12 primary
and 130 secondary topics, and (2) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based
methodology leveraging factual knowledge to synthesize culturally relevant
question-answer pairs. The CultureSynth-7 synthetic benchmark contains 19,360
entries and 4,149 manually verified entries across 7 languages. Evaluation of
14 prevalent LLMs of different sizes reveals clear performance stratification
led by ChatGPT-4o-Latest and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that
a 3B-parameter threshold is necessary for achieving basic cultural competence,
models display varying architectural biases in knowledge processing, and
significant geographic disparities exist across models. We believe that
CultureSynth offers a scalable framework for developing culturally aware AI
systems while reducing reliance on manual annotation\footnote{Benchmark is

  The growing importance of environmental, social, and governance data in
regulatory and investment contexts has increased the need for accurate,
interpretable, and internationally aligned representations of non-financial
risks, particularly those reported in unstructured news sources. However,
aligning such controversy-related data with principle-based normative
frameworks, such as the United Nations Global Compact or Sustainable
Development Goals, presents significant challenges. These frameworks are
typically expressed in abstract language, lack standardized taxonomies, and
differ from the proprietary classification systems used by commercial data
providers. In this paper, we present a semi-automatic method for constructing
structured knowledge representations of environmental, social, and governance
events reported in the news. Our approach uses lightweight ontology design,
formal pattern modeling, and large language models to convert normative
principles into reusable templates expressed in the Resource Description
Framework. These templates are used to extract relevant information from news
content and populate a structured knowledge graph that links reported incidents
to specific framework principles. The result is a scalable and transparent
framework for identifying and interpreting non-compliance with international
sustainability guidelines.

  In this paper, we introduce Spotlight, a novel paradigm for information
extraction that produces concise, engaging narratives by highlighting the most
compelling aspects of a document. Unlike traditional summaries, which
prioritize comprehensive coverage, spotlights selectively emphasize intriguing
content to foster deeper reader engagement with the source material. We
formally differentiate spotlights from related constructs and support our
analysis with a detailed benchmarking study using new datasets curated for this
work. To generate high-quality spotlights, we propose a two-stage approach:
fine-tuning a large language model on our benchmark data, followed by alignment
via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our comprehensive evaluation
demonstrates that the resulting model not only identifies key elements with
precision but also enhances readability and boosts the engagement value of the
original document.

Comments: 7 pages
\\
  The proliferation of clickbait headlines poses significant challenges to the
credibility of information and user trust in digital media. While recent
advances in machine learning have improved the detection of manipulative
content, the lack of explainability limits their practical adoption. This paper
presents a model for explainable clickbait detection that not only identifies
clickbait titles but also attributes them to specific linguistic manipulation
strategies. We introduce a synthetic dataset generated by systematically
augmenting real news headlines using a predefined catalogue of clickbait
strategies. This dataset enables controlled experimentation and detailed
analysis of model behaviour. We present a two-stage framework for automatic
clickbait analysis comprising detection and tactic attribution. In the first
stage, we compare a fine-tuned BERT classifier with large language models
(LLMs), specifically GPT-4.0 and Gemini 2.4 Flash, under both zero-shot
prompting and few-shot prompting enriched with illustrative clickbait headlines
and their associated persuasive tactics. In the second stage, a dedicated
BERT-based classifier predicts the specific clickbait strategies present in
each headline. This work advances the development of transparent and
trustworthy AI systems for combating manipulative media content. We share the
dataset with the research community at

Title: EmoBench-Reddit: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Evaluating the Emotional
  Intelligence of Multimodal Large Language Models
Authors: Haokun Li, Yazhou Zhang, Jizhi Ding, Qiuchi Li, Peng Zhang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they
have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a variety of vision-language
tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective
visual question answering or captioning, inadequately assessing the models'
ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EmoBench-Reddit, a novel, hierarchical benchmark for
multimodal emotion understanding. The dataset comprises 350 meticulously
curated samples from the social media platform Reddit, each containing an
image, associated user-provided text, and an emotion category (sad, humor,
sarcasm, happy) confirmed by user flairs. We designed a hierarchical task
framework that progresses from basic perception to advanced cognition, with
each data point featuring six multiple-choice questions and one open-ended
question of increasing difficulty. Perception tasks evaluate the model's
ability to identify basic visual elements (e.g., colors, objects), while
cognition tasks require scene reasoning, intent understanding, and deep empathy
integrating textual context. We ensured annotation quality through a
combination of AI assistance (Claude 4) and manual verification.

  Language model (LM) benchmarking faces several challenges: comprehensive
evaluations are costly, benchmarks often fail to measure the intended
capabilities, and evaluation quality can degrade due to labeling errors and
benchmark saturation. Although various strategies have been proposed to
mitigate these issues, they tend to address individual aspects in isolation,
neglecting broader questions about overall evaluation quality. Here, we
introduce Fluid Benchmarking, a new evaluation approach that advances LM
benchmarking across multiple dimensions. Inspired by psychometrics, Fluid
Benchmarking is based on the insight that the relative value of benchmark items
depends on an LM's capability level, suggesting that evaluation should adapt to
each LM. Methodologically, Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model
based on existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to
select evaluation items dynamically, similar to computerized adaptive testing
in education. In our experiments, we compare Fluid Benchmarking against the
common practice of random item sampling as well as more sophisticated
baselines, including alternative methods grounded in item response theory. We
examine four dimensions -- efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation --
and find that Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance in all of them
(e.g., higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items).
Our analysis shows that the two components of Fluid Benchmarking have distinct
effects: item response theory, used to map performance into a latent ability
space, increases validity, while dynamic item selection reduces variance.
Overall, our results suggest that LM benchmarking can be substantially improved
by moving beyond static evaluation.

Title: We Argue to Agree: Towards Personality-Driven Argumentation-Based
  Negotiation Dialogue Systems for Tourism
Authors: Priyanshu Priya, Saurav Dudhate, Desai Vishesh Yasheshbhai, Asif Ekbal
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Paper is accepted at EMNLP (Findings) 2025
\\
  Integrating argumentation mechanisms into negotiation dialogue systems
improves conflict resolution through exchanges of arguments and critiques.
Moreover, incorporating personality attributes enhances adaptability by
aligning interactions with individuals' preferences and styles. To advance
these capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, we propose a novel
Personality-driven Argumentation-based Negotiation Dialogue Generation (PAN-DG)
task. To support this task, we introduce PACT, a dataset of Personality-driven
Argumentation-based negotiation Conversations for Tourism sector. This dataset,
generated using Large Language Models (LLMs), features three distinct
personality profiles, viz. Argumentation Profile, Preference Profile, and
Buying Style Profile to simulate a variety of negotiation scenarios involving
diverse personalities. Thorough automatic and manual evaluations indicate that
the dataset comprises high-quality dialogues. Further, we conduct comparative
experiments between pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs for the PAN-DG task.
Multi-dimensional evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned LLMs effectively
generate personality-driven rational responses during negotiations. This
underscores the effectiveness of PACT in enhancing personalization and
reasoning capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, thereby establishing a
foundation for future research in this domain.

Title: Joint Effects of Argumentation Theory, Audio Modality and Data
  Enrichment on LLM-Based Fallacy Classification
Authors: Hongxu Zhou, Hylke Westerdijk, Khondoker Ittehadul Islam
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  This study investigates how context and emotional tone metadata influence
large language model (LLM) reasoning and performance in fallacy classification
tasks, particularly within political debate settings. Using data from U.S.
presidential debates, we classify six fallacy types through various prompting
strategies applied to the Qwen-3 (8B) model. We introduce two theoretically
grounded Chain-of-Thought frameworks: Pragma-Dialectics and the Periodic Table
of Arguments, and evaluate their effectiveness against a baseline prompt under
three input settings: text-only, text with context, and text with both context
and audio-based emotional tone metadata. Results suggest that while theoretical
prompting can improve interpretability and, in some cases, accuracy, the
addition of context and especially emotional tone metadata often leads to
lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biases the model toward labeling
statements as \textit{Appeal to Emotion}, worsening logical reasoning. Overall,
basic prompts often outperformed enhanced ones, suggesting that attention
dilution from added inputs may worsen rather than improve fallacy
classification in LLMs.

  Toxicity
Authors: Shiyao Cui, Xijia Feng, Yingkang Wang, Junxiao Yang, Zhexin Zhang,

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Emojis are globally used non-verbal cues in digital communication, and
extensive research has examined how large language models (LLMs) understand and
utilize emojis across contexts. While usually associated with friendliness or
playfulness, it is observed that emojis may trigger toxic content generation in
LLMs. Motivated by such a observation, we aim to investigate: (1) whether
emojis can clearly enhance the toxicity generation in LLMs and (2) how to
interpret this phenomenon. We begin with a comprehensive exploration of
emoji-triggered LLM toxicity generation by automating the construction of
prompts with emojis to subtly express toxic intent. Experiments across 5
mainstream languages on 7 famous LLMs along with jailbreak tasks demonstrate
that prompts with emojis could easily induce toxicity generation. To understand
this phenomenon, we conduct model-level interpretations spanning semantic
cognition, sequence generation and tokenization, suggesting that emojis can act
as a heterogeneous semantic channel to bypass the safety mechanisms. To pursue
deeper insights, we further probe the pre-training corpus and uncover potential
correlation between the emoji-related data polution with the toxicity
generation behaviors. Supplementary materials provide our implementation code
and data. (Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive contents)

Title: Text2Mem: A Unified Memory Operation Language for Memory Operating
  System
Authors: Felix Wang, Boyu Chen, Kerun Xu, Bo Tang, Feiyu Xiong, and Zhiyu Li
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 11 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Large language model agents increasingly depend on memory to sustain long
horizon interaction, but existing frameworks remain limited. Most expose only a
few basic primitives such as encode, retrieve, and delete, while higher order
operations like merge, promote, demote, split, lock, and expire are missing or
inconsistently supported. Moreover, there is no formal and executable
specification for memory commands, leaving scope and lifecycle rules implicit
and causing unpredictable behavior across systems. We introduce Text2Mem, a
unified memory operation language that provides a standardized pathway from
natural language to reliable execution. Text2Mem defines a compact yet
expressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each
instruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields
and semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects
with normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution,
while adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real
memory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are
integrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution
contract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across
heterogeneous backends. We also outline Text2Mem Bench, a planned benchmark
that separates schema generation from backend execution to enable systematic
evaluation. Together, these components establish the first standardized
foundation for memory control in agents.

Title: Differentially-private text generation degrades output language quality
Authors: Erion \c{C}ano and Ivan Habernal
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 20 pages, 3 figures, 35 tables
\\
  Ensuring user privacy by synthesizing data from large language models (LLMs)
tuned under differential privacy (DP) has become popular recently. However, the
impact of DP fine-tuned LLMs on the quality of the language and the utility of
the texts they produce has not been investigated. In this work, we tune five
LLMs with three corpora under four levels of privacy and assess the length, the
grammatical correctness, and the lexical diversity of the text outputs they
produce. We also probe the utility of the synthetic outputs in downstream
classification tasks such as book genre recognition based on book descriptions
and cause of death recognition based on verbal autopsies. The results indicate
that LLMs tuned under stronger privacy constrains produce texts that are
shorter by at least 77 %, that are less grammatically correct by at least 9 %,
and are less diverse by at least 10 % in bi-gram diversity. Furthermore, the
accuracy they reach in downstream classification tasks decreases, which might
be detrimental to the usefulness of the generated synthetic data.

Title: Optimal Brain Restoration for Joint Quantization and Sparsification of
  LLMs
Authors: Hang Guo, Yawei Li, Luca Benini
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Preprint
\\
  Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) compression, such as
quantization and pruning, have achieved notable success. However, as these
techniques gradually approach their respective limits, relying on a single
method for further compression has become increasingly challenging. In this
work, we explore an alternative solution by combining quantization and
sparsity. This joint approach, though promising, introduces new difficulties
due to the inherently conflicting requirements on weight distributions:
quantization favors compact ranges, while pruning benefits from high variance.
To attack this problem, we propose Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR), a general
and training-free framework that aligns pruning and quantization by error
compensation between both. OBR minimizes performance degradation on downstream
tasks by building on a second-order Hessian objective, which is then
reformulated into a tractable problem through surrogate approximation and
ultimately reaches a closed-form solution via group error compensation.
Experiments show that OBR enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50%
sparsity on existing LLMs, and delivers up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory
reduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline.

Title: RanAT4BIE: Random Adversarial Training for Biomedical Information
  Extraction
Authors: Jian Chen, Shengyi Lv, Leilei Su

Comments: Accepted for publication at the International Joint Conference on
  Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025
\\
  We introduce random adversarial training (RAT), a novel framework
successfully applied to biomedical information extraction (BioIE) tasks.
Building on PubMedBERT as the foundational architecture, our study first
validates the effectiveness of conventional adversarial training in enhancing
pre-trained language models' performance on BioIE tasks. While adversarial
training yields significant improvements across various performance metrics, it
also introduces considerable computational overhead. To address this
limitation, we propose RAT as an efficiency solution for biomedical information
extraction. This framework strategically integrates random sampling mechanisms
with adversarial training principles, achieving dual objectives: enhanced model
generalization and robustness while significantly reducing computational costs.
Through comprehensive evaluations, RAT demonstrates superior performance
compared to baseline models in BioIE tasks. The results highlight RAT's
potential as a transformative framework for biomedical natural language
processing, offering a balanced solution to the model performance and
computational efficiency.

Title: The Prompt Engineering Report Distilled: Quick Start Guide for Life
  Sciences
Authors: Valentin Romanov and Steven A Niederer
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Developing effective prompts demands significant cognitive investment to
generate reliable, high-quality responses from Large Language Models (LLMs). By
deploying case-specific prompt engineering techniques that streamline
frequently performed life sciences workflows, researchers could achieve
substantial efficiency gains that far exceed the initial time investment
required to master these techniques. The Prompt Report published in 2025
outlined 58 different text-based prompt engineering techniques, highlighting
the numerous ways prompts could be constructed. To provide actionable
guidelines and reduce the friction of navigating these various approaches, we
distil this report to focus on 6 core techniques: zero-shot, few-shot
approaches, thought generation, ensembling, self-criticism, and decomposition.
We breakdown the significance of each approach and ground it in use cases
relevant to life sciences, from literature summarization and data extraction to
editorial tasks. We provide detailed recommendations for how prompts should and
shouldn't be structured, addressing common pitfalls including multi-turn
conversation degradation, hallucinations, and distinctions between reasoning
and non-reasoning models. We examine context window limitations, agentic tools
like Claude Code, while analyzing the effectiveness of Deep Research tools
across OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Perplexity platforms, discussing current
limitations. We demonstrate how prompt engineering can augment rather than
replace existing established individual practices around data processing and
document editing. Our aim is to provide actionable guidance on core prompt
engineering principles, and to facilitate the transition from opportunistic
prompting to an effective, low-friction systematic practice that contributes to
higher quality research.

Title: Ko-PIQA: A Korean Physical Commonsense Reasoning Dataset with Cultural
  Context
Authors: Dasol Choi, Jungwhan Kim, Guijin Son
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Physical commonsense reasoning datasets like PIQA are predominantly
English-centric and lack cultural diversity. We introduce Ko-PIQA, a Korean
physical commonsense reasoning dataset that incorporates cultural context.
Starting from 3.01 million web-crawled questions, we employed a multi-stage
filtering approach using three language models to identify 11,553 PIQA-style
questions. Through GPT-4o refinement and human validation, we obtained 441
high-quality question-answer pairs. A key feature of Ko-PIQA is its cultural
grounding: 19.7\% of questions contain culturally specific elements like
traditional Korean foods (kimchi), clothing (hanbok), and specialized
appliances (kimchi refrigerators) that require culturally-aware reasoning
beyond direct translation. We evaluate seven language models on Ko-PIQA, with
the best model achieving 83.22\% accuracy while the weakest reaches only
59.86\%, demonstrating significant room for improvement. Models particularly
struggle with culturally specific scenarios, highlighting the importance of
culturally diverse datasets. Ko-PIQA serves as both a benchmark for Korean
language models and a foundation for more inclusive commonsense reasoning
research. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

Title: Transformer Enhanced Relation Classification: A Comparative Analysis of

Authors: Bowen Jing, Yang Cui, Tianpeng Huang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  In the era of large language model, relation extraction (RE) plays an
important role in information extraction through the transformation of
unstructured raw text into structured data (Wadhwa et al., 2023). In this
paper, we systematically compare the performance of deep supervised learning
approaches without transformers and those with transformers. We used a series
of non-transformer architectures such as PA-LSTM(Zhang et al., 2017),
C-GCN(Zhang et al., 2018), and AGGCN(attention guide GCN)(Guo et al., 2019),
and a series of transformer architectures such as BERT, RoBERTa, and R-BERT(Wu
and He, 2019). Our comparison included traditional metrics like micro F1, as
well as evaluations in different scenarios, varying sentence lengths, and
different percentages of the dataset for training. Our experiments were
conducted on TACRED, TACREV, and RE-TACRED. The results show that
transformer-based models outperform non-transformer models, achieving micro F1
scores of 80-90% compared to 64-67% for non-transformer models. Additionally,
we briefly review the research journey in supervised relation classification
and discuss the role and current status of large language models (LLMs) in
relation extraction.

Title: Continually Adding New Languages to Multilingual Language Models
Authors: Abraham Toluwase Owodunni and Sachin Kumar
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Multilingual language models are trained on a fixed set of languages, and to
support new languages, the models need to be retrained from scratch. This is an
expensive endeavor and is often infeasible, as model developers tend not to
release their pre-training data. Naive approaches, such as continued
pretraining, suffer from catastrophic forgetting; however, mitigation
strategies like experience replay cannot be applied due to the lack of original
pretraining data. In this work, we investigate the problem of continually
adding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining
data in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address
this problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank
Adapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of
the model frozen. LayRA builds on two insights: (1) LoRA reduces forgetting,
and (2) multilingual models encode inputs in the source language in the initial
layers, reason in English in intermediate layers, and translate back to the
source language in final layers. We experiment with adding multiple
combinations of Galician, Swahili, and Urdu to pretrained language models and
evaluate each method on diverse multilingual tasks. We find that LayRA provides
the overall best tradeoff between preserving models' capabilities in previously
supported languages, while being competitive with existing approaches such as
LoRA in learning new languages. We also demonstrate that using model
arithmetic, the adapted models can be equipped with strong instruction
following abilities without access to any instruction tuning data in the target
languages.

  This study presents the first multi-platform sentiment analysis of public
opinion on the 15-minute city concept across Twitter, Reddit, and news media.
Using compressed transformer models and Llama-3-8B for annotation, we classify
sentiment across heterogeneous text domains. Our pipeline handles long-form and
short-form text, supports consistent annotation, and enables reproducible
evaluation. We benchmark five models (DistilRoBERTa, DistilBERT, MiniLM,
ELECTRA, TinyBERT) using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, reporting
F1-score, AUC, and training time. DistilRoBERTa achieved the highest F1
(0.8292), TinyBERT the best efficiency, and MiniLM the best cross-platform
consistency. Results show News data yields inflated performance due to class
imbalance, Reddit suffers from summarization loss, and Twitter offers moderate
challenge. Compressed models perform competitively, challenging assumptions
that larger models are necessary. We identify platform-specific trade-offs and
propose directions for scalable, real-world sentiment classification in urban
planning discourse.

  The emergence of decentralized social media platforms presents new
opportunities and challenges for real-time analysis of public discourse. This
study introduces CognitiveSky, an open-source and scalable framework designed
for sentiment, emotion, and narrative analysis on Bluesky, a federated Twitter

Programming Interface (API), CognitiveSky applies transformer-based models to
annotate large-scale user-generated content and produces structured and
analyzable outputs. These summaries drive a dynamic dashboard that visualizes
evolving patterns in emotion, activity, and conversation topics. Built entirely
on free-tier infrastructure, CognitiveSky achieves both low operational cost
and high accessibility. While demonstrated here for monitoring mental health
discourse, its modular design enables applications across domains such as
disinformation detection, crisis response, and civic sentiment analysis. By
bridging large language models with decentralized networks, CognitiveSky offers
a transparent, extensible tool for computational social science in an era of
shifting digital ecosystems.

Authors: Amirhossein Abaskohi, Raymond Li, Chuyuan Li, Shafiq Joty, Giuseppe

Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: EMNLP 2025
\\
  We introduce CEMTM, a context-enhanced multimodal topic model designed to
infer coherent and interpretable topic structures from both short and long
documents containing text and images. CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision
language models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a
distributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic
inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with
the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities.
Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document
without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit
word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six
multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and
multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further
analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its
ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as
scientific articles.

Title: Improving LLMs' Learning for Coreference Resolution
Authors: Yujian Gan, Yuan Liang, Yanni Lin, Juntao Yu, Massimo Poesio
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Coreference Resolution (CR) is crucial for many NLP tasks, but existing LLMs
struggle with hallucination and under-performance. In this paper, we
investigate the limitations of existing LLM-based approaches to CR-specifically
the Question-Answering (QA) Template and Document Template methods and propose
two novel techniques: Reversed Training with Joint Inference and Iterative
Document Generation. Our experiments show that Reversed Training improves the
QA Template method, while Iterative Document Generation eliminates
hallucinations in the generated source text and boosts coreference resolution.
Integrating these methods and techniques offers an effective and robust
solution to LLM-based coreference resolution.

Title: ClaimIQ at CheckThat! 2025: Comparing Prompted and Fine-Tuned Language
  Models for Verifying Numerical Claims
Authors: Anirban Saha Anik and Md Fahimul Kabir Chowdhury and Andrew Wyckoff

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Notebook for the CheckThat! Lab at CLEF 2025
\\
  This paper presents our system for Task 3 of the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab,
which focuses on verifying numerical and temporal claims using retrieved
evidence. We explore two complementary approaches: zero-shot prompting with
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) and supervised fine-tuning using
parameter-efficient LoRA. To enhance evidence quality, we investigate several
selection strategies, including full-document input and top-k sentence
filtering using BM25 and MiniLM. Our best-performing model LLaMA fine-tuned
with LoRA achieves strong performance on the English validation set. However, a
notable drop in the test set highlights a generalization challenge. These
findings underscore the importance of evidence granularity and model adaptation
for robust numerical fact verification.

  Claim normalization, the transformation of informal social media posts into
concise, self-contained statements, is a crucial step in automated
fact-checking pipelines. This paper details our submission to the CLEF-2025
CheckThat! Task~2, which challenges systems to perform claim normalization
across twenty languages, divided into thirteen supervised (high-resource) and
seven zero-shot (no training data) tracks.
  Our approach, leveraging fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) for
supervised languages and Large Language Model (LLM) prompting for zero-shot
scenarios, achieved podium positions (top three) in fifteen of the twenty
languages. Notably, this included second-place rankings in eight languages,
five of which were among the seven designated zero-shot languages, underscoring
the effectiveness of our LLM-based zero-shot strategy. For Portuguese, our
initial development language, our system achieved an average METEOR score of
0.5290, ranking third. All implementation artifacts, including inference,
training, evaluation scripts, and prompt configurations, are publicly available

Title: Unsupervised Candidate Ranking for Lexical Substitution via Holistic
  Sentence Semantics
Authors: Zhongyang Hu, Naijie Gu, Xiangzhi Tao, Tianhui Gu, Yibing Zhou
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  A key subtask in lexical substitution is ranking the given candidate words. A
common approach is to replace the target word with a candidate in the original
sentence and feed the modified sentence into a model to capture semantic
differences before and after substitution. However, effectively modeling the
bidirectional influence of candidate substitution on both the target word and
its context remains challenging. Existing methods often focus solely on
semantic changes at the target position or rely on parameter tuning over
multiple evaluation metrics, making it difficult to accurately characterize
semantic variation. To address this, we investigate two approaches: one based
on attention weights and another leveraging the more interpretable integrated
gradients method, both designed to measure the influence of context tokens on
the target token and to rank candidates by incorporating semantic similarity
between the original and substituted sentences. Experiments on the LS07 and
SWORDS datasets demonstrate that both approaches improve ranking performance.

Title: LVLMs are Bad at Overhearing Human Referential Communication

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP 2025 (Main)
\\
  During spontaneous conversations, speakers collaborate on novel referring
expressions, which they can then re-use in subsequent conversations.
Understanding such referring expressions is an important ability for an
embodied agent, so that it can carry out tasks in the real world. This requires
integrating and understanding language, vision, and conversational interaction.
We study the capabilities of seven state-of-the-art Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs) as overhearers to a corpus of spontaneous conversations between
pairs of human discourse participants engaged in a collaborative
object-matching task. We find that such a task remains challenging for current
LVLMs and they all fail to show a consistent performance improvement as they
overhear more conversations from the same discourse participants repeating the
same task for multiple rounds. We release our corpus and code for
reproducibility and to facilitate future research.

Title: PeruMedQA: Benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on Peruvian Medical
  Exams - Dataset Construction and Evaluation
Authors: Rodrigo M. Carrillo-Larco, Jesus Lov\'on Melgarejo, Manuel

Categories: cs.CL cs.LG

\\
  BACKGROUND: Medical large language models (LLMS) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in answering medical examinations. However, the extent to which
this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from
a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as
LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a
dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians
pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate
and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the
fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice
question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12
medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including
medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific
prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient
fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it
utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS:
medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of
correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion
parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results
<50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all
LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters
across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and
research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those
exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties
should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.

Title: On the Distinctive Co-occurrence Characteristics of Antonymy
Authors: Zhihan Cao, Hiroaki Yamada, Takenobu Tokunaga
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted by *SEM 2025
\\
  Antonymy has long received particular attention in lexical semantics.
Previous studies have shown that antonym pairs frequently co-occur in text,
across genres and parts of speech, more often than would be expected by chance.
However, whether this co-occurrence pattern is distinctive of antonymy remains
unclear, due to a lack of comparison with other semantic relations. This work
fills the gap by comparing antonymy with three other relations across parts of
speech using robust co-occurrence metrics. We find that antonymy is distinctive
in three respects: antonym pairs co-occur with high strength, in a preferred
linear order, and within short spans. All results are available online.

Title: HARP: Hallucination Detection via Reasoning Subspace Projection
Authors: Junjie Hu, Gang Tu, ShengYu Cheng, Jinxin Li, Jinting Wang, Rui Chen,
  Zhilong Zhou, Dongbo Shan
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a major barrier to their
reliable use in critical decision-making. Although existing hallucination
detection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with
disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To
address these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via
reasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP
establishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct
sum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes
linguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these
subspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its
parameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are
obtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the
reasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input
features for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP
reduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original,
filters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness. Experiments across
multiple datasets show that HARP achieves state-of-the-art hallucination
detection performance; in particular, it achieves an AUROC of 92.8% on
TriviaQA, outperforming the previous best method by 7.5%.

Title: HiChunk: Evaluating and Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with
  Hierarchical Chunking
Authors: Wensheng Lu, Keyu Chen, Ruizhi Qiao, Xing Sun
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 17 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables
\\
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of
language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, document
chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation
tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are
inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to
evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which
includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized
evidence-dense quetion answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence
sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level
document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the
Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments
demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different
chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves
better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing
the overall performance of RAG systems.

Title: D$^2$HScore: Reasoning-Aware Hallucination Detection via Semantic
  Breadth and Depth Analysis in LLMs
Authors: Yue Ding, Xiaofang Zhu, Tianze Xia, Junfei Wu, Xinlong Chen, Qiang
  Liu, Liang Wang
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: under review
\\
  Although large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
practical application is often hindered by the generation of non-factual
content, which is called "hallucination". Ensuring the reliability of LLMs'
outputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as
finance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination
detection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics.
Leveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of
LLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the
semantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic
depth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we
propose \textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)},
a training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1)
\textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of
token representations within each layer; and (2) \textbf{Inter-Layer Drift},
which tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across
layers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather
than noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention
signals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of
representation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and
lightweight proxy for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across
five open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
D$^2$HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.

Authors: Sampoorna Poria, Xiaolei Huang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Rapid developments of large language models have revolutionized many NLP
tasks for English data. Unfortunately, the models and their evaluations for
low-resource languages are being overlooked, especially for languages in South
Asia. Although there are more than 650 languages in South Asia, many of them
either have very limited computational resources or are missing from existing
language models. Thus, a concrete question to be answered is: Can we assess the
current stage and challenges to inform our NLP community and facilitate model
developments for South Asian languages? In this survey, we have comprehensively
examined current efforts and challenges of NLP models for South Asian languages
by retrieving studies since 2020, with a focus on transformer-based models,
such as BERT, T5, & GPT. We present advances and gaps across 3 essential
aspects: data, models, & tasks, such as available data sources, fine-tuning
strategies, & domain applications. Our findings highlight substantial issues,
including missing data in critical domains (e.g., health), code-mixing, and
lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Our survey aims to raise awareness
within the NLP community for more targeted data curation, unify benchmarks
tailored to cultural and linguistic nuances of South Asia, and encourage an
equitable representation of South Asian languages. The complete list of

Categories: cs.CL

\\
  With many endangered languages at risk of disappearing, efforts to preserve
them now rely more than ever on using technology alongside culturally informed
teaching strategies. This study examines user behaviors in TALKA, a generative
AI-powered chatbot designed for Hakka language engagement, by employing a
dual-layered analytical framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy of cognitive
processes and dialogue act categorization. We analyzed 7,077 user utterances,
each carefully annotated according to six cognitive levels and eleven dialogue
act types. These included a variety of functions, such as asking for
information, requesting translations, making cultural inquiries, and using
language creatively. Pragmatic classifications further highlight how different
types of dialogue acts--such as feedback, control commands, and social
greetings--align with specific cognitive intentions. The results suggest that
generative AI chatbots can support language learning in meaningful
ways--especially when they are designed with an understanding of how users
think and communicate. They may also help learners express themselves more
confidently and connect with their cultural identity. The TALKA case provides
empirical insights into how AI-mediated dialogue facilitates cognitive
development in low-resource language learners, as well as pragmatic negotiation
and socio-cultural affiliation. By focusing on AI-assisted language learning,
this study offers new insights into how technology can support language
preservation and educational practice.

Title: Dynamic Span Interaction and Graph-Aware Memory for Entity-Level
  Sentiment Classification
Authors: Md. Mithun Hossain, Sanjara, Md. Shakil Hossain, and Sudipto Chaki
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Entity-level sentiment classification involves identifying the sentiment
polarity linked to specific entities within text. This task poses several
challenges: effectively modeling the subtle and complex interactions between
entities and their surrounding sentiment expressions; capturing dependencies
that may span across sentences; and ensuring consistent sentiment predictions
for multiple mentions of the same entity through coreference resolution.
Additionally, linguistic phenomena such as negation, ambiguity, and overlapping
opinions further complicate the analysis. These complexities make entity-level
sentiment classification a difficult problem, especially in real-world, noisy
textual data. To address these issues, we propose SpanEIT, a novel framework
integrating dynamic span interaction and graph-aware memory mechanisms for
enhanced entity-sentiment relational modeling. SpanEIT builds span-based
representations for entities and candidate sentiment phrases, employs
bidirectional attention for fine-grained interactions, and uses a graph
attention network to capture syntactic and co-occurrence relations. A
coreference-aware memory module ensures entity-level consistency across
documents. Experiments on FSAD, BARU, and IMDB datasets show SpanEIT
outperforms state-of-the-art transformer and hybrid baselines in accuracy and
F1 scores. Ablation and interpretability analyses validate the effectiveness of
our approach, underscoring its potential for fine-grained sentiment analysis in
applications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in industry but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting their reliability in critical applications. This work
addresses hallucination reduction in consumer grievance chatbots built using
LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, a compact model frequently used in industry. We develop
HalluDetect, an LLM-based hallucination detection system that achieves an F1

chatbot architectures, we find that out of them, AgentBot minimizes
hallucinations to 0.4159 per turn while maintaining the highest token accuracy
(96.13%), making it the most effective mitigation strategy. Our findings
provide a scalable framework for hallucination mitigation, demonstrating that
optimized inference strategies can significantly improve factual accuracy.
While applied to consumer law, our approach generalizes to other high-risk

\\
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
Personalized Image Aesthetic Assessment (PIAA) as a scalable alternative to
expert evaluations. However, their predictions may reflect subtle biases
influenced by demographic factors such as gender, age, and education. In this
work, we propose AesBiasBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs along two
complementary dimensions: (1) stereotype bias, quantified by measuring
variations in aesthetic evaluations across demographic groups; and (2)
alignment between model outputs and genuine human aesthetic preferences. Our
benchmark covers three subtasks (Aesthetic Perception, Assessment, Empathy) and
introduces structured metrics (IFD, NRD, AAS) to assess both bias and
alignment. We evaluate 19 MLLMs, including proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o,
Claude-3.5-Sonnet) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL-2.5, Qwen2.5-VL).
Results indicate that smaller models exhibit stronger stereotype biases,
whereas larger models align more closely with human preferences. Incorporating
identity information often exacerbates bias, particularly in emotional
judgments. These findings underscore the importance of identity-aware
evaluation frameworks in subjective vision-language tasks.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.CY
\\
  The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in mental health and other
sensitive domains raises urgent questions about ethical reasoning, fairness,
and responsible alignment. Yet, existing benchmarks for moral and clinical
decision-making do not adequately capture the unique ethical dilemmas
encountered in mental health practice, where confidentiality, autonomy,
beneficence, and bias frequently intersect. To address this gap, we introduce
Ethical Reasoning in Mental Health (EthicsMH), a pilot dataset of 125 scenarios
designed to evaluate how AI systems navigate ethically charged situations in
therapeutic and psychiatric contexts. Each scenario is enriched with structured
fields, including multiple decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected
model behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints. This
structure enables evaluation not only of decision accuracy but also of
explanation quality and alignment with professional norms. Although modest in
scale and developed with model-assisted generation, EthicsMH establishes a task
framework that bridges AI ethics and mental health decision-making. By
releasing this dataset, we aim to provide a seed resource that can be expanded
through community and expert contributions, fostering the development of AI
systems capable of responsibly handling some of society's most delicate
decisions.

Title: A Dynamic Knowledge Update-Driven Model with Large Language Models for
  Fake News Detection
Authors: Di Jin, Jun Yang, Xiaobao Wang, Junwei Zhang, Shuqi Li, Dongxiao He
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  As the Internet and social media evolve rapidly, distinguishing credible news
from a vast amount of complex information poses a significant challenge. Due to
the suddenness and instability of news events, the authenticity labels of news
can potentially shift as events develop, making it crucial for fake news
detection to obtain the latest event updates. Existing methods employ
retrieval-augmented generation to fill knowledge gaps, but they suffer from
issues such as insufficient credibility of retrieved content and interference
from noisy information. We propose a dynamic knowledge update-driven model for
fake news detection (DYNAMO), which leverages knowledge graphs to achieve
continuous updating of new knowledge and integrates with large language models
to fulfill dual functions: news authenticity detection and verification of new
knowledge correctness, solving the two key problems of ensuring the
authenticity of new knowledge and deeply mining news semantics. Specifically,
we first construct a news-domain-specific knowledge graph. Then, we use Monte
Carlo Tree Search to decompose complex news and verify them step by step.
Finally, we extract and update new knowledge from verified real news texts and
reasoning paths. Experimental results demonstrate that DYNAMO achieves the best
performance on two real-world datasets.

  Motion instruction is a crucial task that helps athletes refine their
technique by analyzing movements and providing corrective guidance. Although
recent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding,
generating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to
the highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative
guidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the
differences between a learner's motion and a reference under temporal and
physical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the
acquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors
effectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we
illustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and
boxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data.
Experiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of
directions merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information.
CoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on
boxing. Analysis further confirms that it elaborates on errors and their

Title: Room acoustics affect communicative success in hybrid meeting spaces: a
  pilot study
Authors: Robert Einig and Stefan Janscha and Jonas Schuster and Julian Koch and
  Martin Hagmueller and Barbara Schuppler
Categories: cs.CL eess.AS
\\
  Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, universities and companies have
increasingly integrated hybrid features into their meeting spaces, or even
created dedicated rooms for this purpose. While the importance of a fast and
stable internet connection is often prioritized, the acoustic design of seminar
rooms is frequently overlooked. Poor acoustics, particularly excessive
reverberation, can lead to issues such as misunderstandings, reduced speech
intelligibility or cognitive and vocal fatigue. This pilot study investigates
whether room acoustic interventions in a seminar room at Graz University of
Technology support better communication in hybrid meetings. For this purpose,
we recorded two groups of persons twice, once before and once after improving
the acoustics of the room. Our findings -- despite not reaching statistical
significance due to the small sample size - indicate clearly that our spatial
interventions improve communicative success in hybrid meetings. To make the
paper accessible also for readers from the speech communication community, we
explain room acoustics background, relevant for the interpretation of our
results.

Title: An Agentic Toolkit for Adaptive Information Extraction from Regulatory
  Documents
Authors: Gaye Colakoglu, G\"urkan Solmaz and Jonathan F\"urst
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Declaration of Performance (DoP) documents, mandated by EU regulation,
certify the performance of construction products. While some of their content
is standardized, DoPs vary widely in layout, language, schema, and format,
posing challenges for automated key-value pair extraction (KVP) and question
answering (QA). Existing static or LLM-only IE pipelines often hallucinate and
fail to adapt to this structural diversity. Our domain-specific, stateful
agentic system addresses these challenges through a planner-executor-responder
architecture. The system infers user intent, detects document modality, and
orchestrates tools dynamically for robust, traceable reasoning while avoiding
tool misuse or execution loops. Evaluation on a curated DoP dataset
demonstrates improved robustness across formats and languages, offering a
scalable solution for structured data extraction in regulated workflows.

\\
  Customer feedback in industrial forums reflect a rich but underexplored
source of insight into real-world product experience. These publicly shared
discussions offer an organic view of user expectations, frustrations, and
success stories shaped by the specific contexts of use. Yet, harnessing this
information for systematic analysis remains challenging due to the unstructured
and domain-specific nature of the content. The lack of structure and
specialized vocabulary makes it difficult for traditional data analysis
techniques to accurately interpret, categorize, and quantify the feedback,
thereby limiting its potential to inform product development and support
strategies. To address these challenges, this paper presents the User
eXperience Perception Insights Dataset (UXPID), a collection of 7130
artificially synthesized and anonymized user feedback branches extracted from a
public industrial automation forum. Each JavaScript object notation (JSON)
record contains multi-post comments related to specific hardware and software
products, enriched with metadata and contextual conversation data. Leveraging a
large language model (LLM), each branch is systematically analyzed and
annotated for UX insights, user expectations, severity and sentiment ratings,
and topic classifications. The UXPID dataset is designed to facilitate research
in user requirements, user experience (UX) analysis, and AI-driven feedback
processing, particularly where privacy and licensing restrictions limit access
to real-world data. UXPID supports the training and evaluation of
transformer-based models for tasks such as issue detection, sentiment analysis,
and requirements extraction in the context of technical forums.

Title: When Curiosity Signals Danger: Predicting Health Crises Through Online
  Medication Inquiries
Authors: Dvora Goncharok, Arbel Shifman, Alexander Apartsin, Yehudit Aperstein
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Online medical forums are a rich and underutilized source of insight into
patient concerns, especially regarding medication use. Some of the many
questions users pose may signal confusion, misuse, or even the early warning
signs of a developing health crisis. Detecting these critical questions that
may precede severe adverse events or life-threatening complications is vital
for timely intervention and improving patient safety. This study introduces a
novel annotated dataset of medication-related questions extracted from online
forums. Each entry is manually labelled for criticality based on clinical risk
factors. We benchmark the performance of six traditional machine learning
classifiers using TF-IDF textual representations, alongside three
state-of-the-art large language model (LLM)-based classification approaches
that leverage deep contextual understanding. Our results highlight the
potential of classical and modern methods to support real-time triage and alert
systems in digital health spaces. The curated dataset is made publicly
available to encourage further research at the intersection of
patient-generated data, natural language processing, and early warning systems
for critical health events. The dataset and benchmark are available at:

  Narratives
Authors: Eden Mama, Liel Sheri, Yehudit Aperstein, Alexander Apartsin
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 6 pages, 1 figure
\\
  The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare raises
critical questions about their ability to interpret patient-generated
narratives, which are often informal, ambiguous, and noisy. Existing benchmarks
typically rely on clean, structured clinical text, offering limited insight
into model performance under realistic conditions. In this work, we present a
novel synthetic dataset designed to simulate patient self-descriptions
characterized by varying levels of linguistic noise, fuzzy language, and
layperson terminology. Our dataset comprises clinically consistent scenarios
annotated with ground-truth diagnoses, spanning a spectrum of communication
clarity to reflect diverse real-world reporting styles. Using this benchmark,
we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art models (LLMs), including
BERT-based and encoder-decoder T5 models. To support reproducibility and future
research, we release the Noisy Diagnostic Benchmark (NDB), a structured dataset
of noisy, synthetic patient descriptions designed to stress-test and compare
the diagnostic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) under realistic
linguistic conditions. We made the benchmark available for the community:

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP 2025 demo
\\
  Political pledges reflect candidates' policy commitments, but tracking their
fulfilment requires reasoning over incremental evidence distributed across
multiple, dynamically updated sources. Existing methods simplify this task into
a document classification task, overlooking its dynamic, temporal and
multi-document nature. To address this issue, we introduce
\textsc{PledgeTracker}, a system that reformulates pledge verification into
structured event timeline construction. PledgeTracker consists of three core
components: (1) a multi-step evidence retrieval module; (2) a timeline
construction module and; (3) a fulfilment filtering module, allowing the
capture of the evolving nature of pledge fulfilment and producing interpretable
and structured timelines. We evaluate PledgeTracker in collaboration with
professional fact-checkers in real-world workflows, demonstrating its
effectiveness in retrieving relevant evidence and reducing human verification
effort.

Title: SCDTour: Embedding Axis Ordering and Merging for Interpretable Semantic
  Change Detection
Authors: Taichi Aida and Danushka Bollegala
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Findings of EMNLP2025
\\
  In Semantic Change Detection (SCD), it is a common problem to obtain
embeddings that are both interpretable and high-performing. However, improving
interpretability often leads to a loss in the SCD performance, and vice versa.
To address this problem, we propose SCDTour, a method that orders and merges
interpretable axes to alleviate the performance degradation of SCD. SCDTour
considers both (a) semantic similarity between axes in the embedding space, as
well as (b) the degree to which each axis contributes to semantic change.
Experimental results show that SCDTour preserves performance in semantic change
detection while maintaining high interpretability. Moreover, agglomerating the
sorted axes produces a more refined set of word senses, which achieves
comparable or improved performance against the original full-dimensional
embeddings in the SCD task. These findings demonstrate that SCDTour effectively
balances interpretability and SCD performance, enabling meaningful
interpretation of semantic shifts through a small number of refined axes.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Memory extraction is crucial for maintaining coherent ultra-long dialogues in
human-robot role-playing scenarios. However, existing methods often exhibit
uncontrolled memory growth. To address this, we propose MOOM, the first
dual-branch memory plugin that leverages literary theory by modeling plot
development and character portrayal as core storytelling elements.
Specifically, one branch summarizes plot conflicts across multiple time scales,
while the other extracts the user's character profile. MOOM further integrates
a forgetting mechanism, inspired by the ``competition-inhibition'' memory
theory, to constrain memory capacity and mitigate uncontrolled growth.
Furthermore, we present ZH-4O, a Chinese ultra-long dialogue dataset
specifically designed for role-playing, featuring dialogues that average 600
turns and include manually annotated memory information. Experimental results
demonstrate that MOOM outperforms all state-of-the-art memory extraction
methods, requiring fewer large language model invocations while maintaining a
controllable memory capacity.

  Language and embodied perspective taking are essential for human
collaboration, yet few computational models address both simultaneously. This
work investigates the PerspAct system [1], which integrates the ReAct (Reason
and Act) paradigm with Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate developmental
stages of perspective taking, grounded in Selman's theory [2]. Using an
extended director task, we evaluate GPT's ability to generate internal
narratives aligned with specified developmental stages, and assess how these
influence collaborative performance both qualitatively (action selection) and
quantitatively (task efficiency). Results show that GPT reliably produces
developmentally-consistent narratives before task execution but often shifts
towards more advanced stages during interaction, suggesting that language
exchanges help refine internal representations. Higher developmental stages
generally enhance collaborative effectiveness, while earlier stages yield more
variable outcomes in complex contexts. These findings highlight the potential
of integrating embodied perspective taking and language in LLMs to better model
developmental dynamics and stress the importance of evaluating internal speech
during combined linguistic and embodied tasks.

Title: Uncertainty in Authorship: Why Perfect AI Detection Is Mathematically
  Impossible
Authors: Aadil Gani Ganie
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) become more advanced, it is increasingly
difficult to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. This
paper draws a conceptual parallel between quantum uncertainty and the limits of
authorship detection in natural language. We argue that there is a fundamental
trade-off: the more confidently one tries to identify whether a text was
written by a human or an AI, the more one risks disrupting the text's natural
flow and authenticity. This mirrors the tension between precision and
disturbance found in quantum systems. We explore how current detection
methods--such as stylometry, watermarking, and neural classifiers--face
inherent limitations. Enhancing detection accuracy often leads to changes in
the AI's output, making other features less reliable. In effect, the very act
of trying to detect AI authorship introduces uncertainty elsewhere in the text.
Our analysis shows that when AI-generated text closely mimics human writing,
perfect detection becomes not just technologically difficult but theoretically
impossible. We address counterarguments and discuss the broader implications
for authorship, ethics, and policy. Ultimately, we suggest that the challenge
of AI-text detection is not just a matter of better tools--it reflects a
deeper, unavoidable tension in the nature of language itself.

Title: Designing LLMs for cultural sensitivity: Evidence from English-Japanese
  translation
Authors: Helene Tenzer and Oumnia Abidi and Stefan Feuerriegel
Categories: cs.CL cs.CY cs.HC
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday communication,
including multilingual interactions across different cultural contexts. While
LLMs can now generate near-perfect literal translations, it remains unclear
whether LLMs support culturally appropriate communication. In this paper, we
analyze the cultural sensitivity of different LLM designs when applied to
English-Japanese translations of workplace e-mails. Here, we vary the prompting
strategies: (1) naive "just translate" prompts, (2) audience-targeted prompts
specifying the recipient's cultural background, and (3) instructional prompts
with explicit guidance on Japanese communication norms. Using a mixed-methods
study, we then analyze culture-specific language patterns to evaluate how well
translations adapt to cultural norms. Further, we examine the appropriateness
of the tone of the translations as perceived by native speakers. We find that
culturally-tailored prompting can improve cultural fit, based on which we offer
recommendations for designing culturally inclusive LLMs in multilingual
settings.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful multimodal reasoning but suffer
from slow autoregressive inference, limiting their deployment in real-time
applications. We introduce Spec-LLaVA, a system that applies speculative
decoding to accelerate VLMs without sacrificing output quality. Spec-LLaVA
pairs a lightweight draft VLM with a large target model: the draft speculates
future tokens, which the target verifies in parallel, allowing multiple tokens
to be generated per step. To maximize efficiency, we design a dynamic
tree-based verification algorithm that adaptively expands and prunes
speculative branches using draft model confidence. On MS COCO out-of-domain
images, Spec-LLaVA achieves up to 3.28$\times$ faster decoding on LLaVA-1.5
(7B, 13B) with no loss in generation quality. This work presents a lossless
acceleration framework for VLMs using dynamic tree-structured speculative
decoding, opening a path toward practical real-time multimodal assistants.
Importantly, the lightweight draft model design makes the framework amenable to
resource-constrained or on-device deployment settings.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with external tools,
reward modeling for tool use has become a critical yet underexplored area.
Existing reward models, trained primarily on natural language outputs, struggle
to evaluate tool-based reasoning and execution. To quantify this gap, we
introduce FC-RewardBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically assess
reward models' performance in tool-calling scenarios. Our analysis shows that
current reward models often miss key signals of effective tool use,
highlighting the need for domain-specific modeling. To address this, we propose
a training framework for outcome-based reward models using data synthesized
from permissively licensed, open-weight LLMs. We train models ranging from 1.7B
to 14B parameters and evaluate them across seven out-of-domain benchmarks.
These models consistently outperform general-purpose baselines, achieving up to
25\% average improvement in downstream task performance and enabling
data-efficient fine-tuning through reward-guided filtering.

the problem of sentiment explanation through sentiment-based biases and query
expansion. We achieve experimental results outperforming baseline models on a

  Large language models (LLMs) are able to generate grammatically well-formed
text, but how do they encode their syntactic knowledge internally? While prior
work has focused largely on binary grammatical contrasts, in this work, we
study the representation and control of two multidimensional hierarchical
grammar phenomena - verb tense and aspect - and for each, identify distinct,
orthogonal directions in residual space using linear discriminant analysis.
Next, we demonstrate causal control over both grammatical features through
concept steering across three generation tasks. Then, we use these identified
features in a case study to investigate factors influencing effective steering
in multi-token generation. We find that steering strength, location, and
duration are crucial parameters for reducing undesirable side effects such as
topic shift and degeneration. Our findings suggest that models encode tense and
aspect in structurally organized, human-like ways, but effective control of
such features during generation is sensitive to multiple factors and requires
manual tuning or automated optimization.

  This paper introduces SENSE (Shared Embedding for N-lingual Speech and tExt),
an open-source solution inspired by the SAMU-XLSR framework and conceptually
similar to Meta AI's SONAR models. These approaches rely on a teacher-student
framework to align a self-supervised speech encoder with the language-agnostic
continuous representations of a text encoder at the utterance level. We
describe how the original SAMU-XLSR method has been updated by selecting a
stronger teacher text model and a better initial speech encoder. The source
code for training and using SENSE models has been integrated into the
SpeechBrain toolkit, and the first SENSE model we trained has been publicly
released. We report experimental results on multilingual and multimodal
semantic tasks, where our SENSE model achieves highly competitive performance.
Finally, this study offers new insights into how semantics are captured in such
semantically aligned speech encoders.

tokens covering five entity types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, TIME).
We evaluated each system's output against the manually annotated gold standard
dataset using F1-score. The results show that LLMs generally outperform
conventional tools in recognizing context-sensitive entities like person names,
with Gemini achieving the highest average F1-score. However, traditional
systems like Stanza demonstrate greater consistency in structured tags such as
LOCATION and DATE. We also observed variability among LLMs, particularly in
handling temporal expressions and multi-word organizations. Our findings
highlight that while LLMs offer improved contextual understanding, traditional
tools remain competitive in specific tasks, informing model selection.

  In this study, we investigate the benefits of domain-specific self-supervised
pre-training for both offline and streaming ASR in Air Traffic Control (ATC)
environments. We train BEST-RQ models on 4.5k hours of unlabeled ATC data, then
fine-tune on a smaller supervised ATC set. To enable real-time processing, we
propose using chunked attention and dynamic convolutions, ensuring low-latency
inference. We compare these in-domain SSL models against state-of-the-art,
general-purpose speech encoders such as w2v-BERT 2.0 and HuBERT. Results show
that domain-adapted pre-training substantially improves performance on standard
ATC benchmarks, significantly reducing word error rates when compared to models
trained on broad speech corpora. Furthermore, the proposed streaming approach
further improves word error rate under tighter latency constraints, making it
particularly suitable for safety-critical aviation applications. These findings
highlight that specializing SSL representations for ATC data is a practical
path toward more accurate and efficient ASR systems in real-world operational
settings.

Comments: Accepted at EMNLP 2025
\\
  In natural language processing tasks, pure reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration and slow
convergence; while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods, although efficient in
training, have limited performance ceiling and less solid theoretical
foundation compared to RL. To address efficiency-capability trade-off, we
propose the Guess-Think-Answer (GTA) framework that combines the efficiency of
SFT with the capability gains of RL in a unified training paradigm. GTA works
by having the model first produce a provisional guess (optimized via
cross-entropy loss), then reflect on this guess before generating the final
answer, with RL rewards shaping both the final output and the format of the
entire GTA structure. This hybrid approach achieves both faster convergence
than pure RL and higher performance ceiling than pure SFT. To mitigate gradient
conflicts between the two training signals, we employ loss masking and gradient
constraints. Empirical results on four text classification benchmarks
demonstrate that GTA substantially accelerates convergence while outperforming
both standalone SFT and RL baselines.

while preserving bidirectional privacy. Specifically, we design a two-stage
framework: (1) a prompt generator trained on the server-side to capture
domain-specific and task-agnostic capabilities, and (2) user-side gradient-free
optimization that tailors soft prompts for individual tasks. This approach
eliminates the need for users to access model weights or upload private data,
requiring only a single customized vector per task while achieving effective
adaptation. Furthermore, the evaluation of CBP-Tuning in the commonsense
reasoning, medical and financial domain settings demonstrates superior
performance compared to baselines, showcasing its advantages in task-agnostic
processing and privacy preservation.

  This notebook reports the XplaiNLP submission to the CheckThat! 2025 shared
task on multilingual subjectivity detection. We evaluate two approaches: (1)
supervised fine-tuning of transformer encoders, EuroBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and
German-BERT, on monolingual and machine-translated training data; and (2)
zero-shot prompting using two LLMs: o3-mini for Annotation (rule-based
labelling) and gpt-4.1-mini for DoubleDown (contrastive rewriting) and
Perspective (comparative reasoning). The Annotation Approach achieves 1st place
in the Italian monolingual subtask with an F_1 score of 0.8104, outperforming
the baseline of 0.6941. In the Romanian zero-shot setting, the fine-tuned
XLM-RoBERTa model obtains an F_1 score of 0.7917, ranking 3rd and exceeding the
baseline of 0.6461. The same model also performs reliably in the multilingual
task and improves over the baseline in Greek. For German, a German-BERT model
fine-tuned on translated training data from typologically related languages
yields competitive performance over the baseline. In contrast, performance in
the Ukrainian and Polish zero-shot settings falls slightly below the respective
baselines, reflecting the challenge of generalization in low-resource
cross-lingual scenarios.

  Puns are a form of humorous wordplay that exploits polysemy and phonetic
similarity. While LLMs have shown promise in detecting puns, we show in this
paper that their understanding often remains shallow, lacking the nuanced grasp
typical of human interpretation. By systematically analyzing and reformulating
existing pun benchmarks, we demonstrate how subtle changes in puns are
sufficient to mislead LLMs. Our contributions include comprehensive and nuanced
pun detection benchmarks, human evaluation across recent LLMs, and an analysis
of the robustness challenges these models face in processing puns.

  Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where
failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective
paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches
often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful
ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a
text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called
RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition
LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting
and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output
(IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References
(IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation
tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy
incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens
from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing
interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and
remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL)
methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust,
human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.

  Diminished reality (DR) refers to the digital removal of real-world objects
by compositing background content in their place. This thesis presents a
real-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in
shared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset
user to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment,
ensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants.
Removal is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection,
followed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer,
implemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be
portable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D
scanning of the environment. The system utilises YOLOv11 for object detection
and a modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for
high-quality video inpainting. At 720p resolution, the pipeline sustains frame
rates exceeding 20 fps, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time diminished
reality for practical privacy-preserving MR applications.

Title: SurgLaVi: Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Surgical Vision-Language
  Representation Learning
Authors: Alejandra Perez, Chinedu Nwoye, Ramtin Raji Kermani, Omid Mohareri and
  Muhammad Abdullah Jamal
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by
aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and
transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However,
progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural
diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets.
In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical
vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from
more than 200 procedures, and comprising hierarchical levels at phase-, step-,
and task-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that
systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and
segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality
annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy
samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with
contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and
easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-\b{eta}, an
open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from
public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP
datasets. To demonstrate the value of SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP,
a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a
representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across
phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale,
semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate
into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as
a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.

Title: Building a General SimCLR Self-Supervised Foundation Model Across
  Neurological Diseases to Advance 3D Brain MRI Diagnoses
Authors: Emily Kaczmarek, Justin Szeto, Brennan Nichyporuk, Tal Arbel
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: Accepted to ICCV 2025 Workshop CVAMD
\\
  3D structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans are commonly
acquired in clinical settings to monitor a wide range of neurological
conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and stroke. While deep
learning models have shown promising results analyzing 3D MRI across a number
of brain imaging tasks, most are highly tailored for specific tasks with
limited labeled data, and are not able to generalize across tasks and/or
populations. The development of self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the
creation of large medical foundation models that leverage diverse, unlabeled
datasets ranging from healthy to diseased data, showing significant success in
2D medical imaging applications. However, even the very few foundation models
for 3D brain MRI that have been developed remain limited in resolution, scope,
or accessibility. In this work, we present a general, high-resolution
SimCLR-based SSL foundation model for 3D brain structural MRI, pre-trained on
18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 publicly available datasets spanning
diverse neurological diseases. We compare our model to Masked Autoencoders
(MAE), as well as two supervised baselines, on four diverse downstream
prediction tasks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Our
fine-tuned SimCLR model outperforms all other models across all tasks. Notably,
our model still achieves superior performance when fine-tuned using only 20% of
labeled training samples for predicting Alzheimer's disease. We use publicly
available code and data, and release our trained model at
https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/3D-Neuro-SimCLR, contributing a broadly
applicable and accessible foundation model for clinical brain MRI analysis.

Title: USCTNet: A deep unfolding nuclear-norm optimization solver for
  physically consistent HSI reconstruction
Authors: Xiaoyang Ma and Yiyang Chai and Xinran Qu and Hong Sun
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single RGB image is
ill-posed and can become physically inconsistent when the camera spectral
sensitivity (CSS) and scene illumination are misspecified. We formulate
RGB-to-HSI reconstruction as a physics-grounded inverse problem regularized by
a nuclear norm in a learnable transform domain, and we explicitly estimate CSS
and illumination to define the forward operator embedded in each iteration,
ensuring colorimetric consistency. To avoid the cost and instability of full
singular-value decompositions (SVDs) required by singular-value thresholding
(SVT), we introduce a data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT operator. Building on
these components, we develop USCTNet, a deep unfolding solver tailored to HSI
that couples a parameter estimation module with learnable proximal updates.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy. Code:

Title: A Comparison and Evaluation of Fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks
  to Large Language Models for Image Classification and Segmentation of Brain
  Tumors on MRI
Authors: Felicia Liu, Jay J. Yoo, Farzad Khalvati
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in text-based
healthcare tasks. However, their utility in image-based applications remains
unexplored. We investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks,
specifically glioma classification and segmentation, and compare their
performance to that of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using
the BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a
general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after
fine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma
classification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and
balanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but
suffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors.
Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined
(e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center
point, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately
localized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs
consistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction
of glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting
but failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon
method yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in
both tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement
from fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not
well-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative
training strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance,
robustness, and utility in the medical space.

Title: Stable Part Diffusion 4D: Multi-View RGB and Kinematic Parts Video
  Generation
Authors: Hao Zhang, Chun-Han Yao, Simon Donn\'e, Narendra Ahuja, Varun Jampani
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Page: https://stablepartdiffusion4d.github.io/
\\
  We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired
RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part
segmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns
to produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object
articulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch
diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part
segmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different
part counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks
to continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to
share the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to
be recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion
Fusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a
contrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of
part predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted
to 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few
manual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K,
a curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from
Objaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part
video sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse
scenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare
articulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream
animation and motion-related tasks.

Title: SegSLR: Promptable Video Segmentation for Isolated Sign Language
  Recognition
Authors: Sven Schreiber, Noha Sarhan, Simone Frintrop, Christian Wilms
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at GCPR 2025
\\
  Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) approaches primarily rely on RGB
data or signer pose information. However, combining these modalities often
results in the loss of crucial details, such as hand shape and orientation, due
to imprecise representations like bounding boxes. Therefore, we propose the
ISLR system SegSLR, which combines RGB and pose information through promptable
zero-shot video segmentation. Given the rough localization of the hands and the
signer's body from pose information, we segment the respective parts through
the video to maintain all relevant shape information. Subsequently, the
segmentations focus the processing of the RGB data on the most relevant body
parts for ISLR. This effectively combines RGB and pose information. Our
evaluation on the complex ChaLearn249 IsoGD dataset shows that SegSLR
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies indicate
that SegSLR strongly benefits from focusing on the signer's body and hands,
justifying our design choices.

  Scene Segmentation
Authors: Jecia Z.Y. Mao, Francis X Creighton, Russell H Taylor, Manish Sahu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Accurate segmentation and tracking of relevant elements of the surgical scene
is crucial to enable context-aware intraoperative assistance and decision
making. Current solutions remain tethered to domain-specific, supervised models
that rely on labeled data and required domain-specific data to adapt to new
surgical scenarios and beyond predefined label categories. Recent advances in
prompt-driven vision foundation models (VFM) have enabled open-set, zero-shot
segmentation across heterogeneous medical images. However, dependence of these
models on manual visual or textual cues restricts their deployment in
introperative surgical settings. We introduce a speech-guided collaborative
perception (SCOPE) framework that integrates reasoning capabilities of large
language model (LLM) with perception capabilities of open-set VFMs to support
on-the-fly segmentation, labeling and tracking of surgical instruments and
anatomy in intraoperative video streams. A key component of this framework is a
collaborative perception agent, which generates top candidates of VFM-generated
segmentation and incorporates intuitive speech feedback from clinicians to
guide the segmentation of surgical instruments in a natural human-machine
collaboration paradigm. Afterwards, instruments themselves serve as interactive
pointers to label additional elements of the surgical scene. We evaluated our
proposed framework on a subset of publicly available Cataract1k dataset and an
in-house ex-vivo skull-base dataset to demonstrate its potential to generate
on-the-fly segmentation and tracking of surgical scene. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its dynamic capabilities through a live mock ex-vivo experiment.
This human-AI collaboration paradigm showcase the potential of developing
adaptable, hands-free, surgeon-centric tools for dynamic operating-room
environments.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Common computer vision systems typically assume ideal pinhole cameras but
fail when facing real-world camera effects such as fisheye distortion and
rolling shutter, mainly due to the lack of learning from training data with
camera effects. Existing data generation approaches suffer from either high
costs, sim-to-real gaps or fail to accurately model camera effects. To address
this bottleneck, we propose 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing (4D-GRT), a novel two-stage
pipeline that combines 4D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based ray tracing
for camera effect simulation. Given multi-view videos, 4D-GRT first
reconstructs dynamic scenes, then applies ray tracing to generate videos with
controllable, physically accurate camera effects. 4D-GRT achieves the fastest
rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality
compared to existing baselines. Additionally, we construct eight synthetic
dynamic scenes in indoor environments across four camera effects as a benchmark
to evaluate generated videos with camera effects.

\\
  Automated tools for video editing and assembly have applications ranging from
filmmaking and advertisement to content creation for social media. Previous
video editing work has mainly focused on either retrieval or user interfaces,
leaving actual editing to the user. In contrast, we propose to automate the
core task of video editing, formulating it as sequential decision making
process. Ours is a multi-agent approach. We design an Editor agent and a Critic
agent. The Editor takes as input a collection of video clips together with
natural language instructions and uses tools commonly found in video editing
software to produce an edited sequence. On the other hand, the Critic gives
natural language feedback to the editor based on the produced sequence or
renders it if it is satisfactory. We introduce a learning-based approach for
enabling effective communication across specialized agents to address the
language-driven video editing task. Finally, we explore an LLM-as-a-judge
metric for evaluating the quality of video editing system and compare it with
general human preference. We evaluate our system's output video sequences
qualitatively and quantitatively through a user study and find that our system
vastly outperforms existing approaches in terms of coverage, time constraint
satisfaction, and human preference.

  Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are central to glioma imaging but
raise safety, cost, and accessibility concerns. Predicting contrast enhancement
from non-contrast MRI using machine learning (ML) offers a safer alternative,
as enhancement reflects tumor aggressiveness and informs treatment planning.
Yet scanner and cohort variability hinder robust model selection. We propose a
stability-aware framework to identify reproducible ML pipelines for multicenter
prediction of glioma MRI contrast enhancement. We analyzed 1,446 glioma cases
from four TCIA datasets (UCSF-PDGM, UPENN-GB, BRATS-Africa, BRATS-TCGA-LGG).
Non-contrast T1WI served as input, with enhancement derived from paired
post-contrast T1WI. Using PyRadiomics under IBSI standards, 108 features were
extracted and combined with 48 dimensionality reduction methods and 25
classifiers, yielding 1,200 pipelines. Rotational validation was trained on
three datasets and tested on the fourth. Cross-validation prediction accuracies
ranged from 0.91 to 0.96, with external testing achieving 0.87 (UCSF-PDGM),
0.98 (UPENN-GB), and 0.95 (BRATS-Africa), with an average of 0.93. F1,
precision, and recall were stable (0.87 to 0.96), while ROC-AUC varied more
widely (0.50 to 0.82), reflecting cohort heterogeneity. The MI linked with ETr
pipeline consistently ranked highest, balancing accuracy and stability. This
framework demonstrates that stability-aware model selection enables reliable
prediction of contrast enhancement from non-contrast glioma MRI, reducing
reliance on GBCAs and improving generalizability across centers. It provides a
scalable template for reproducible ML in neuro-oncology and beyond.

Title: Group Evidence Matters: Tiling-based Semantic Gating for Dense Object
  Detection
Authors: Yilun Xiao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range
viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter[cite: 5]. This paper presents a
detector-agnostic post-processing framework that converts overlap-induced
redundancy into group evidence[cite: 6]. Overlapping tiling first recovers
low-confidence candidates[cite: 7]. A Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids)
and a Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) then validates group
evidence[cite: 7]. Validated groups receive controlled confidence reweighting
before class-aware NMS fusion[cite: 8]. Experiments on VisDrone show a recall
increase from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093) and a precision adjustment from 0.801 to
0.595, yielding F1=0.669[cite: 9]. Post-processing latency averages 0.095 s per
image[cite: 10]. These results indicate recall-first, precision-trade-off
behavior that benefits recall-sensitive applications such as far-field counting
and monitoring[cite: 10]. Ablation confirms that tiling exposes missed objects,
spatial clustering stabilizes geometry, semantic clustering enforces appearance
coherence, and reweighting provides calibrated integration with the
baseline[cite: 11]. The framework requires no retraining and integrates with
modern detectors[cite: 12]. Future work will reduce semantic gating cost and
extend the approach with temporal cues[cite: 13].

  The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D
scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However,
existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity,
sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address
these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale
simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes
by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally
generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and
covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve
massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts
with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing
pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world
scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these
scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate
the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout
generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the
complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for
scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and
navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the
data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.

Title: Well-Conditioned Polynomial Representations for Mathematical Handwriting
  Recognition
Authors: Robert M. Corless, Deepak Singh Kalhan, Stephen M. Watt
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Previous work has made use of a parameterized plane curve polynomial
representation for mathematical handwriting, with the polynomials represented
in a Legendre or Legendre-Sobolev graded basis. This provides a compact
geometric representation for the digital ink. Preliminary results have also
been shown for Chebyshev and Chebyshev-Sobolev bases. This article explores the
trade-offs between basis choice and polynomial degree to achieve accurate
modeling with a low computational cost. To do this, we consider the condition
number for polynomial evaluation in these bases and bound how the various inner
products give norms for the variations between symbols.

Title: Multi-Task Diffusion Approach For Prediction of Glioma Tumor Progression
Authors: Aghiles Kebaili, Romain Modzelewski, J\'er\^ome Lapuyade-Lahorgue,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Glioma, an aggressive brain malignancy characterized by rapid progression and
its poor prognosis, poses significant challenges for accurate evolution
prediction. These challenges are exacerbated by sparse, irregularly acquired
longitudinal MRI data in clinical practice, where incomplete follow-up
sequences create data imbalances and make reliable modeling difficult. In this
paper, we present a multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic, pixel-wise
prediction of glioma progression. The model simultaneously generates future
FLAIR sequences at any chosen time point and estimates spatial probabilistic
tumor evolution maps derived using signed distance fields (SDFs), allowing
uncertainty quantification. To capture temporal dynamics of tumor evolution
across arbitrary intervals, we integrate a pretrained deformation module that
models inter-scan changes using deformation fields. Regarding the common
clinical limitation of data scarcity, we implement a targeted augmentation
pipeline that synthesizes complete sequences of three follow-up scans and
imputes missing MRI modalities from available patient studies, improving the
stability and accuracy of predictive models. Based on merely two follow-up
scans at earlier timepoints, our framework produces flexible time-depending
probability maps, enabling clinicians to interrogate tumor progression risks at
any future temporal milestone. We further introduce a radiotherapy-weighted
focal loss term that leverages radiation dose maps, as these highlight regions
of greater clinical importance during model training. The proposed method was
trained on a public dataset and evaluated on an internal private dataset,
achieving promising results in both cases

Title: Point-Plane Projections for Accurate LiDAR Semantic Segmentation in
  Small Data Scenarios
Authors: Simone Mosco, Daniel Fusaro, Wanmeng Li, Emanuele Menegatti, Alberto
  Pretto
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
Comments: Submitted to Computer Vision and Image Understanding
\\
  LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation is essential for interpreting 3D
environments in applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Recent
methods achieve strong performance by exploiting different point cloud
representations or incorporating data from other sensors, such as cameras or
external datasets. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational complexity and require large amounts of training data, limiting
their generalization in data-scarce scenarios. In this paper, we improve the
performance of point-based methods by effectively learning features from 2D
representations through point-plane projections, enabling the extraction of
complementary information while relying solely on LiDAR data. Additionally, we
introduce a geometry-aware technique for data augmentation that aligns with
LiDAR sensor properties and mitigates class imbalance. We implemented and
evaluated our method that applies point-plane projections onto multiple
informative 2D representations of the point cloud. Experiments demonstrate that
this approach leads to significant improvements in limited-data scenarios,
while also achieving competitive results on two publicly available standard
datasets, as SemanticKITTI and PandaSet. The code of our method is available at

Title: OpenUrban3D: Annotation-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation of
  Large-Scale Urban Point Clouds
Authors: Chongyu Wang, Kunlei Jing, Jihua Zhu and Di Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to recognize and segment
objects from arbitrary natural language descriptions, offering the flexibility
to handle novel, fine-grained, or functionally defined categories beyond fixed
label sets. While this capability is crucial for large-scale urban point clouds
that support applications such as digital twins, smart city management, and
urban analytics, it remains largely unexplored in this domain. The main
obstacles are the frequent absence of high-quality, well-aligned multi-view
imagery in large-scale urban point cloud datasets and the poor generalization
of existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipelines across diverse urban
environments with substantial variation in geometry, scale, and appearance. To
address these challenges, we present OpenUrban3D, the first 3D open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that operates
without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained point cloud segmentation
networks, or manual annotations. Our approach generates robust semantic
features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity
rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced
fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model. This design enables
zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic
richness and geometric priors. Extensive experiments on large-scale urban
benchmarks, including SensatUrban and SUM, show that OpenUrban3D achieves
significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene
generalization over existing methods, demonstrating its potential as a flexible
and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding.

  The burgeoning of online education has created an urgent need for robust and
scalable systems to ensure academic integrity during remote examinations.
Traditional human proctoring is often not feasible at scale, while existing
automated solutions can be intrusive or fail to detect a wide range of cheating
behaviors. This paper introduces AutoOEP (Automated Online Exam Proctoring), a
comprehensive, multi-modal framework that leverages computer vision and machine
learning to provide effective, automated proctoring. The system utilizes a
dual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side
view of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several
parallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification
using ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth
movement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module
employs a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile
phones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these
modules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
that analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability
score. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse
exam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying
suspicious activities. The object detection component obtains a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.57 for prohibited items, and the entire framework
processes video streams at approximately 2.4 frames per second without a GPU.
The results demonstrate that AutoOEP is an effective and resource-efficient
solution for automated proctoring, significantly reducing the need for human
intervention and enhancing the integrity of online assessments.

Title: Total Variation Subgradient Guided Image Fusion for Dual-Camera CASSI
  System
Authors: Weiqiang Zhao, Tianzhu Liu, Yuzhe Gui, Yanfeng Gu
Categories: cs.CV physics.optics
\\
  Spectral imaging technology has long-faced fundamental challenges in
balancing spectral, spatial, and temporal reso- lutions. While compressive
sensing-based Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) mitigates this
trade-off through optical encoding, high compression ratios result in ill-posed
reconstruction problems. Traditional model-based methods exhibit limited
performance due to reliance on handcrafted inherent image priors, while deep
learning approaches are constrained by their black-box nature, which
compromises physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose
a dual-camera CASSI reconstruction framework that integrates total variation
(TV) subgradient theory. By es- tablishing an end-to-end SD-CASSI mathematical
model, we reduce the computational complexity of solving the inverse problem
and provide a mathematically well-founded framework for analyzing multi-camera
systems. A dynamic regular- ization strategy is introduced, incorporating
normalized gradient constraints from RGB/panchromatic-derived reference images,
which constructs a TV subgradient similarity function with strict convex
optimization guarantees. Leveraging spatial priors from auxiliary cameras, an
adaptive reference generation and updating mechanism is designed to provide
subgradient guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency. The theoretical
framework establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for
computational spectral imaging, demonstrating robust performance across diverse
reconstruction scenarios. The source code is available at

Title: Lightweight Metadata-Aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder for
  Earth Observation
Authors: Mohanad Albughdadi
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Recent advances in Earth Observation have focused on large-scale foundation
models. However, these models are computationally expensive, limiting their
accessibility and reuse for downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate
compact architectures as a practical pathway toward smaller general-purpose EO
models. We propose a Metadata-aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder
(MoE-MAE) with only 2.5M parameters. The model combines sparse expert routing
with geo-temporal conditioning, incorporating imagery alongside
latitude/longitude and seasonal/daily cyclic encodings. We pretrain the MoE-MAE
on the BigEarthNet-Landsat dataset and evaluate embeddings from its frozen
encoder using linear probes. Despite its small size, the model competes with
much larger architectures, demonstrating that metadata-aware pretraining
improves transfer and label efficiency. To further assess generalization, we
evaluate on the EuroSAT-Landsat dataset, which lacks explicit metadata, and
still observe competitive performance compared to models with hundreds of
millions of parameters. These results suggest that compact, metadata-aware
MoE-MAEs are an efficient and scalable step toward future EO foundation models.

Title: Simulating Sinogram-Domain Motion and Correcting Image-Domain Artifacts
  Using Deep Learning in HR-pQCT Bone Imaging
Authors: Farhan Sadik, Christopher L. Newman, Stuart J. Warden, and Rachel K.
  Surowiec
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Rigid-motion artifacts, such as cortical bone streaking and trabecular
smearing, hinder in vivo assessment of bone microstructures in high-resolution
peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Despite various motion
grading techniques, no motion correction methods exist due to the lack of
standardized degradation models. We optimize a conventional sinogram-based
method to simulate motion artifacts in HR-pQCT images, creating paired datasets
of motion-corrupted images and their corresponding ground truth, which enables
seamless integration into supervised learning frameworks for motion correction.
As such, we propose an Edge-enhanced Self-attention Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (ESWGAN-GP) to address motion
artifacts in both simulated (source) and real-world (target) datasets. The
model incorporates edge-enhancing skip connections to preserve trabecular edges
and self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, facilitating
motion correction. A visual geometry group (VGG)-based perceptual loss is used
to reconstruct fine micro-structural features. The ESWGAN-GP achieves a mean
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 26.78, structural similarity index measure
(SSIM) of 0.81, and visual information fidelity (VIF) of 0.76 for the source
dataset, while showing improved performance on the target dataset with an SNR
of 29.31, SSIM of 0.87, and VIF of 0.81. The proposed methods address a
simplified representation of real-world motion that may not fully capture the
complexity of in vivo motion artifacts. Nevertheless, because motion artifacts
present one of the foremost challenges to more widespread adoption of this
modality, these methods represent an important initial step toward implementing
deep learning-based motion correction in HR-pQCT.

Title: Gaze Authentication: Factors Influencing Authentication Performance
Authors: Dillon Lohr, Michael J Proulx, Mehedi Hasan Raju, Oleg V Komogortsev
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 17 pages, 2 figures, 8 tables
\\
  This paper examines the key factors that influence the performance of
state-of-the-art gaze-based authentication. Experiments were conducted on a
large-scale, in-house dataset comprising 8,849 subjects collected with Meta
Quest Pro equivalent hardware running a video oculography-driven gaze
estimation pipeline at 72Hz. The state-of-the-art neural network architecture
was employed to study the influence of the following factors on authentication
performance: eye tracking signal quality, various aspects of eye tracking
calibration, and simple filtering on estimated raw gaze. We found that using
the same calibration target depth for eye tracking calibration, fusing
calibrated and non-calibrated gaze, and improving eye tracking signal quality
all enhance authentication performance. We also found that a simple
three-sample moving average filter slightly reduces authentication performance
in general. While these findings hold true for the most part, some exceptions
were noted.

Title: TrueSkin: Towards Fair and Accurate Skin Tone Recognition and Generation
Authors: Haoming Lu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Skin tone recognition and generation play important roles in model fairness,
healthcare, and generative AI, yet they remain challenging due to the lack of
comprehensive datasets and robust methodologies. Compared to other human image
analysis tasks, state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) and image
generation models struggle to recognize and synthesize skin tones accurately.
To address this, we introduce TrueSkin, a dataset with 7299 images
systematically categorized into 6 classes, collected under diverse lighting
conditions, camera angles, and capture settings. Using TrueSkin, we benchmark
existing recognition and generation approaches, revealing substantial biases:
LMMs tend to misclassify intermediate skin tones as lighter ones, whereas
generative models struggle to accurately produce specified skin tones when
influenced by inherent biases from unrelated attributes in the prompts, such as
hairstyle or environmental context. We further demonstrate that training a
recognition model on TrueSkin improves classification accuracy by more than
20\% compared to LMMs and conventional approaches, and fine-tuning with
TrueSkin significantly improves skin tone fidelity in image generation models.
Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive datasets like TrueSkin, which
not only serves as a benchmark for evaluating existing models but also provides
a valuable training resource to enhance fairness and accuracy in skin tone
recognition and generation tasks.

  Animal health monitoring and population management are critical aspects of
wildlife conservation and livestock management that increasingly rely on
automated detection and tracking systems. While Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
based systems combined with computer vision offer promising solutions for
non-invasive animal monitoring across challenging terrains, limited
availability of labeled training data remains an obstacle in developing
effective deep learning (DL) models for these applications. Transfer learning
has emerged as a potential solution, allowing models trained on large datasets
to be adapted for resource-limited scenarios such as those with limited data.
However, the vast landscape of pre-trained neural network architectures makes
it challenging to select optimal models, particularly for researchers new to
the field. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based
transfer learning framework that employs an upper confidence bound (UCB)
algorithm to automatically select the most suitable pre-trained model for
animal detection tasks. Our approach systematically evaluates and ranks
candidate models based on their performance, streamlining the model selection
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a higher
detection rate while requiring significantly less computational time compared
to traditional methods.

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages, 3 Figures, FungiClef2025, Working Notes
\\
  The FungiCLEF 2025 competition addresses the challenge of automatic fungal
species recognition using realistic, field-collected observational data.
Accurate identification tools support both mycologists and citizen scientists,
greatly enhancing large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Effective recognition
systems in this context must handle highly imbalanced class distributions and
provide reliable performance even when very few training samples are available
for many species, especially rare and under-documented taxa that are often
missing from standard training sets. According to competition organizers, about
20\% of all verified fungi observations, representing nearly 20,000 instances,
are associated with these rarely recorded species. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a robust deep learning method based on prototypical networks, which
enhances prototype representations for few-shot fungal classification. Our
prototypical network approach exceeds the competition baseline by more than 30
percentage points in Recall@5 on both the public (PB) and private (PR)
leaderboards. This demonstrates strong potential for accurately identifying
both common and rare fungal species, supporting the main objectives of
FungiCLEF 2025.

Title: Cluster-Level Sparse Multi-Instance Learning for Whole-Slide Images
Authors: Yuedi Zhang, Zhixiang Xia, Guosheng Yin, Bin Liu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages,5 figures
\\
  Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly
labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology,
where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic
relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and
recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack
explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their
robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a
novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering,
within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these
challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to
establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to
assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and
sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective
retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones.
This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability
by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to
recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles.
Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public
histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).

Title: Action Hints: Semantic Typicality and Context Uniqueness for
  Generalizable Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection
Authors: Canhui Tang, Sanping Zhou, Haoyue Shi, Le Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing
anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to
various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments.
Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving
ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human
appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton
representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot
generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection
framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and
uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic
typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic
space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors
during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis
module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton
snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training
samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results
against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech,
UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.

  Recent advances in organoid models have revolutionized the study of human
kidney disease mechanisms and drug discovery by enabling scalable,
cost-effective research without the need for animal sacrifice. Here, we present
a kidney organoid platform optimized for efficient screening in polycystic
kidney disease (PKD). While these systems generate rich spatial-temporal
microscopy video datasets, current manual approaches to analysis remain limited
to coarse classifications (e.g., hit vs. non-hit), often missing valuable
pixel-level and longitudinal information. To help overcome this bottleneck, we
developed Organoid Tracker, a graphical user interface (GUI) platform designed
with a modular plugin architecture, which empowers researchers to extract
detailed, quantitative metrics without programming expertise. Built on the
cutting-edge vision foundation model Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), Organoid
Tracker enables zero-shot segmentation and automated analysis of
spatial-temporal microscopy videos. It quantifies key metrics such as cyst
formation rate, growth velocity, and morphological changes, while generating
comprehensive reports. By providing an extensible, open-source framework,
Organoid Tracker offers a powerful solution for improving and accelerating
research in kidney development, PKD modeling, and therapeutic discovery. The

Title: Mars Traversability Prediction: A Multi-modal Self-supervised Approach
  for Costmap Generation
Authors: Zongwu Xie, Kaijie Yun, Yang Liu, Yiming Ji, Han Li
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  We present a robust multi-modal framework for predicting traversability
costmaps for planetary rovers. Our model fuses camera and LiDAR data to produce
a bird's-eye-view (BEV) terrain costmap, trained self-supervised using
IMU-derived labels. Key updates include a DINOv3-based image encoder,
FiLM-based sensor fusion, and an optimization loss combining Huber and
smoothness terms. Experimental ablations (removing image color, occluding
inputs, adding noise) show only minor changes in MAE/MSE (e.g. MAE increases
from ~0.0775 to 0.0915 when LiDAR is sparsified), indicating that geometry
dominates the learned cost and the model is highly robust. We attribute the
small performance differences to the IMU labeling primarily reflecting terrain
geometry rather than semantics and to limited data diversity. Unlike prior work
claiming large gains, we emphasize our contributions: (1) a high-fidelity,
reproducible simulation environment; (2) a self-supervised IMU-based labeling
pipeline; and (3) a strong multi-modal BEV costmap prediction model. We discuss
limitations and future work such as domain generalization and dataset
expansion.

Title: End-to-End Visual Autonomous Parking via Control-Aided Attention
Authors: Chao Chen, Shunyu Yao, Yuanwu He, Tao Feng, Ruojing Song, Yuliang Guo,
  Xinyu Huang, Chenxu Wu, Ren Liu, and Chen Feng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Precise parking requires an end-to-end system where perception adaptively
provides policy-relevant details-especially in critical areas where fine
control decisions are essential. End-to-end learning offers a unified framework
by directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions, but existing approaches
lack effective synergy between perception and control. We find that
transformer-based self-attention, when used alone, tends to produce unstable
and temporally inconsistent spatial attention, which undermines the reliability
of downstream policy decisions over time. Instead, we propose CAA-Policy, an
end-to-end imitation learning system that allows control signal to guide the
learning of visual attention via a novel Control-Aided Attention (CAA)
mechanism. For the first time, we train such an attention module in a
self-supervised manner, using backpropagated gradients from the control outputs
instead of from the training loss. This strategy encourages the attention to
focus on visual features that induce high variance in action outputs, rather
than merely minimizing the training loss-a shift we demonstrate leads to a more
robust and generalizable policy. To further enhance stability, CAA-Policy
integrates short-horizon waypoint prediction as an auxiliary task, and
introduces a separately trained motion prediction module to robustly track the
target spot over time. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show that
\titlevariable~consistently surpasses both the end-to-end learning baseline and
the modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability. Code is released at

Title: PanoLora: Bridging Perspective and Panoramic Video Generation with LoRA
  Adaptation
Authors: Zeyu Dong, Yuyang Yin, Yuqi Li, Eric Li, Hao-Xiang Guo, Yikai Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Generating high-quality 360{\deg} panoramic videos remains a significant
challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional
perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single
viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering
the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video
generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex
architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal
results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style
transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation
problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections
when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach
efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only
approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection
geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality,
left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

Title: SMILE: A Super-resolution Guided Multi-task Learning Method for
  Hyperspectral Unmixing
Authors: Ruiying Li, Bin Pan, Qiaoying Qu, Xia Xu and Zhenwei Shi
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures
\\
  The performance of hyperspectral unmixing may be constrained by low spatial
resolution, which can be enhanced using super-resolution in a multitask
learning way. However, integrating super-resolution and unmixing directly may
suffer two challenges: Task affinity is not verified, and the convergence of
unmixing is not guaranteed. To address the above issues, in this paper, we
provide theoretical analysis and propose super-resolution guided multi-task
learning method for hyperspectral unmixing (SMILE). The provided theoretical
analysis validates feasibility of multitask learning way and verifies task
affinity, which consists of relationship and existence theorems by proving the
positive guidance of super-resolution. The proposed framework generalizes
positive information from super-resolution to unmixing by learning both shared
and specific representations. Moreover, to guarantee the convergence, we
provide the accessibility theorem by proving the optimal solution of unmixing.
The major contributions of SMILE include providing progressive theoretical
support, and designing a new framework for unmixing under the guidance of
super-resolution. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have
substantiate the usefulness of our work.

Title: A Copula-Guided Temporal Dependency Method for Multitemporal
  Hyperspectral Images Unmixing
Authors: Ruiying Li, Bin Pan, Qiaoying Qu, Xia Xu, Zhenwei Shi
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 14 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing (MTHU) aims to model variable endmembers
and dynamical abundances, which emphasizes the critical temporal information.
However, existing methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependency,
thus fail to capture the dynamical material evolution. Motivated by the ability
of copula theory in modeling dependency structure explicitly, in this paper, we
propose a copula-guided temporal dependency method (Cog-TD) for multitemporal
hyperspectral unmixing. Cog-TD defines new mathematical model, constructs
copula-guided framework and provides two key modules with theoretical support.
The mathematical model provides explicit formulations for MTHU problem
definition, which describes temporal dependency structure by incorporating
copula theory. The copula-guided framework is constructed for utilizing copula
function, which estimates dynamical endmembers and abundances with temporal
dependency. The key modules consist of copula function estimation and temporal
dependency guidance, which computes and employs temporal information to guide
unmixing process. Moreover, the theoretical support demonstrates that estimated
copula function is valid and the represented temporal dependency exists in
hyperspectral images. The major contributions of this paper include redefining
MTHU problem with temporal dependency, proposing a copula-guided framework,
developing two key modules and providing theoretical support. Our experimental
results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of
the proposed method.

Title: 3DAeroRelief: The first 3D Benchmark UAV Dataset for Post-Disaster
  Assessment
Authors: Nhut Le, Ehsan Karimi, and Maryam Rahnemoonfar
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Timely assessment of structural damage is critical for disaster response and
recovery. However, most prior work in natural disaster analysis relies on 2D
imagery, which lacks depth, suffers from occlusions, and provides limited
spatial context. 3D semantic segmentation offers a richer alternative, but
existing 3D benchmarks focus mainly on urban or indoor scenes, with little
attention to disaster-affected areas. To address this gap, we present
3DAeroRelief--the first 3D benchmark dataset specifically designed for
post-disaster assessment. Collected using low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) over hurricane-damaged regions, the dataset features dense 3D point
clouds reconstructed via Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo
techniques. Semantic annotations were produced through manual 2D labeling and
projected into 3D space. Unlike existing datasets, 3DAeroRelief captures 3D
large-scale outdoor environments with fine-grained structural damage in
real-world disaster contexts. UAVs enable affordable, flexible, and safe data
collection in hazardous areas, making them particularly well-suited for
emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of 3DAeroRelief, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models on the dataset to highlight
both the challenges and opportunities of 3D scene understanding in disaster
response. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust 3D
vision systems in real-world applications for post-disaster scenarios.

Title: Filling the Gaps: A Multitask Hybrid Multiscale Generative Framework for
  Missing Modality in Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Nhi Kieu, Kien Nguyen, Arnold Wiliem, Clinton Fookes, Sridha Sridharan
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to DICTA 2025
\\
  Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to
ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world
scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor
failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models'
operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to
reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote
sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first
examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the
heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture
semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class
variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy
dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model
robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we
propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with
three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn
modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness
(HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3)
Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by
encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet,
outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and
state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two
challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and
Potsdam). Source code is made available.

Title: WildSmoke: Ready-to-Use Dynamic 3D Smoke Assets from a Single Video in
  the Wild
Authors: Yuqiu Liu, Jialin Song, Manolis Savva, Wuyang Chen
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We propose a pipeline to extract and reconstruct dynamic 3D smoke assets from
a single in-the-wild video, and further integrate interactive simulation for
smoke design and editing. Recent developments in 3D vision have significantly
improved reconstructing and rendering fluid dynamics, supporting realistic and
temporally consistent view synthesis. However, current fluid reconstructions
rely heavily on carefully controlled clean lab environments, whereas real-world
videos captured in the wild are largely underexplored. We pinpoint three key
challenges of reconstructing smoke in real-world videos and design targeted
techniques, including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization
of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos. Our
method not only outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with
high-quality smoke reconstructions (+2.22 average PSNR on wild videos), but
also enables diverse and realistic editing of fluid dynamics by simulating our
smoke assets. We provide our models, data, and 4D smoke assets at

Title: SVR-GS: Spatially Variant Regularization for Probabilistic Masks in 3D
  Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Ashkan Taghipour, Vahid Naghshin, Benjamin Southwell, Farid Boussaid,
  Hamid Laga, Mohammed Bennamoun
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables fast, high-quality novel view synthesis
but typically relies on densification followed by pruning to optimize the
number of Gaussians. Existing mask-based pruning, such as MaskGS, regularizes
the global mean of the mask, which is misaligned with the local per-pixel
(per-ray) reconstruction loss that determines image quality along individual
camera rays. This paper introduces SVR-GS, a spatially variant regularizer that
renders a per-pixel spatial mask from each Gaussian's effective contribution
along the ray, thereby applying sparsity pressure where it matters: on
low-importance Gaussians. We explore three spatial-mask aggregation strategies,
implement them in CUDA, and conduct a gradient analysis to motivate our final
design. Extensive experiments on Tanks\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360
datasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed
SVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\(\times\) compared to MaskGS and
5.63\(\times\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR
drops, respectively. These gains translate into significantly smaller, faster,
and more memory-efficient models, making them well-suited for real-time
applications such as robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception.

Title: No Mesh, No Problem: Estimating Coral Volume and Surface from Sparse
  Multi-View Images
Authors: Diego Eustachio Farchione, Ramzi Idoughi, Peter Wonka
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Effective reef monitoring requires the quantification of coral growth via
accurate volumetric and surface area estimates, which is a challenging task due
to the complex morphology of corals. We propose a novel, lightweight, and
scalable learning framework that addresses this challenge by predicting the 3D
volume and surface area of coral-like objects from 2D multi-view RGB images.
Our approach utilizes a pre-trained module (VGGT) to extract dense point maps
from each view; these maps are merged into a unified point cloud and enriched
with per-view confidence scores. The resulting cloud is fed to two parallel
DGCNN decoder heads, which jointly output the volume and the surface area of
the coral, as well as their corresponding confidence estimate. To enhance
prediction stability and provide uncertainty estimates, we introduce a
composite loss function based on Gaussian negative log-likelihood in both real
and log domains. Our method achieves competitive accuracy and generalizes well
to unseen morphologies. This framework paves the way for efficient and scalable
coral geometry estimation directly from a sparse set of images, with potential
applications in coral growth analysis and reef monitoring.

Title: Traffic-MLLM: A Spatio-Temporal MLLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
  for Causal Inference in Traffic
Authors: Waikit Xiu, Qiang Lu, Xiying Li, Chen Hu, Shengbo Sun
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  As intelligent transportation systems advance, traffic video understanding
plays an increasingly pivotal role in comprehensive scene perception and causal
analysis. Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately
modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge,
limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model
tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone,
our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing
its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences.
Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge
into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical
reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on
TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic
data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario
generalization capabilities.

Title: Multispectral-NeRF:a multispectral modeling approach based on neural
  radiance fields
Authors: Hong Zhang, Fei Guo, Zihan Xie, Dizhao Yao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  3D reconstruction technology generates three-dimensional representations of
real-world objects, scenes, or environments using sensor data such as 2D
images, with extensive applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and
virtual reality systems. Traditional 3D reconstruction techniques based on 2D
images typically relies on RGB spectral information. With advances in sensor
technology, additional spectral bands beyond RGB have been increasingly
incorporated into 3D reconstruction workflows. Existing methods that integrate
these expanded spectral data often suffer from expensive scheme prices, low
accuracy and poor geometric features. Three - dimensional reconstruction based
on NeRF can effectively address the various issues in current multispectral 3D
reconstruction methods, producing high - precision and high - quality
reconstruction results. However, currently, NeRF and some improved models such
as NeRFacto are trained on three - band data and cannot take into account the
multi - band information. To address this problem, we propose
Multispectral-NeRF, an enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF that can
effectively integrates multispectral information. Our technical contributions
comprise threefold modifications: Expanding hidden layer dimensionality to
accommodate 6-band spectral inputs; Redesigning residual functions to optimize
spectral discrepancy calculations between reconstructed and reference images;
Adapting data compression modules to address the increased bit-depth
requirements of multispectral imagery. Experimental results confirm that
Multispectral-NeRF successfully processes multi-band spectral features while
accurately preserving the original scenes' spectral characteristics.

Title: SPHERE: Semantic-PHysical Engaged REpresentation for 3D Semantic Scene
  Completion
Authors: Zhiwen Yang and Yuxin Peng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task in
autonomous driving systems, assessing voxel-level geometry and semantics for
holistic scene perception. While existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC
methods have achieved considerable progress, they struggle to capture physical
regularities for realistic geometric details. On the other hand, neural
reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS demonstrate superior physical
awareness, but suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence when
handling large-scale, complex autonomous driving scenes, leading to inferior
semantic accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-PHysical
Engaged REpresentation (SPHERE) for camera-based SSC, which integrates voxel
and Gaussian representations for joint exploitation of semantic and physical
information. First, the Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) module
leverages dual-branch 3D scene representations to locate focal voxels as
anchors to guide efficient Gaussian initialization. Then, the Physical-aware
Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) module incorporates semantic spherical harmonics to
model physical-aware contextual details and promote semantic-geometry
consistency through focal distribution alignment, generating SSC results with
realistic details. Extensive experiments and analyses on the popular
SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
SPHERE. The code is available at

Title: StegOT: Trade-offs in Steganography via Optimal Transport
Authors: Chengde Lin, Xuezhu Gong, Shuxue Ding, Mingzhe Yang, Xijun Lu,
  Chengjun Mo
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a
secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models
are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational
autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse.
Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and
secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based
steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the
multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature
distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the
trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a
trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of
both the stego and recovery images. The source code will be released on

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Artificial intelligence (AI) models to automatically classify skin lesions
from dermatology images have shown promising performance but also
susceptibility to bias by skin tone. The most common way of representing skin
tone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has
been criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for
lighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact
(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST
scale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions
using FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when
training models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and
5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data
compared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the
granularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a
detrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the
granularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the
question marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the
FST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in
fair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better
represents the diversity of human skin tones.

Title: Scaling Up Forest Vision with Synthetic Data
Authors: Yihang She, Andrew Blake, David Coomes, Srinivasan Keshav
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Accurate tree segmentation is a key step in extracting individual tree
metrics from forest laser scans, and is essential to understanding ecosystem
functions in carbon cycling and beyond. Over the past decade, tree segmentation
algorithms have advanced rapidly due to developments in AI. However existing,
public, 3D forest datasets are not large enough to build robust tree
segmentation systems. Motivated by the success of synthetic data in other
domains such as self-driving, we investigate whether similar approaches can
help with tree segmentation. In place of expensive field data collection and
annotation, we use synthetic data during pretraining, and then require only
minimal, real forest plot annotation for fine-tuning.
  We have developed a new synthetic data generation pipeline to do this for
forest vision tasks, integrating advances in game-engines with physics-based
LiDAR simulation. As a result, we have produced a comprehensive, diverse,
annotated 3D forest dataset on an unprecedented scale. Extensive experiments
with a state-of-the-art tree segmentation algorithm and a popular real dataset
show that our synthetic data can substantially reduce the need for labelled
real data. After fine-tuning on just a single, real, forest plot of less than
0.1 hectare, the pretrained model achieves segmentations that are competitive
with a model trained on the full scale real data. We have also identified
critical factors for successful use of synthetic data: physics, diversity, and
scale, paving the way for more robust 3D forest vision systems in the future.

Title: Geometrically Constrained and Token-Based Probabilistic Spatial
  Transformers
Authors: Johann Schmidt, Sebastian Stober
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) remains highly sensitive to
geometric variability, where objects appear under arbitrary orientations,
scales, and perspective distortions. While equivariant architectures address
this issue, they typically require substantial computational resources and
restrict the hypothesis space. We revisit Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs)
as a canonicalization tool for transformer-based vision pipelines, emphasizing
their flexibility, backbone-agnostic nature, and lack of architectural
constraints. We propose a probabilistic, component-wise extension that improves
robustness. Specifically, we decompose affine transformations into rotation,
scaling, and shearing, and regress each component under geometric constraints
using a shared localization encoder. To capture uncertainty, we model each
component with a Gaussian variational posterior and perform sampling-based
canonicalization during inference.A novel component-wise alignment loss
leverages augmentation parameters to guide spatial alignment. Experiments on
challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently improves robustness compared to other STNs.

Title: CCoMAML: Efficient Cattle Identification Using Cooperative
  Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
Authors: Rabin Dulal, Lihong Zheng, Ashad Kabir
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Cattle identification is critical for efficient livestock farming management,
currently reliant on radio-frequency identification (RFID) ear tags. However,
RFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and
vulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric
identification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has
emerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated
success in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But
deep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data
availability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions
that require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle
identification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with
Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This
model offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning
from few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been
rigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning
techniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle
identification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores.

  Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which involves learning to generalize using only a
few data samples, has demonstrated promising and superior performances to
ordinary CNN methods. While Bayesian based estimation approaches using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence have shown improvements, they remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks and natural noises. We introduce
ANROT-HELANet, an Adversarially and Naturally RObusT Hellinger Aggregation
Network that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in FSL robustness and
performance. Our approach implements an adversarially and naturally robust
Hellinger distance-based feature class aggregation scheme, demonstrating
resilience to adversarial perturbations up to $\epsilon=0.30$ and Gaussian
noise up to $\sigma=0.30$. The network achieves substantial improvements across
benchmark datasets, including gains of 1.20\% and 1.40\% for 1-shot and 5-shot
scenarios on miniImageNet respectively. We introduce a novel Hellinger
Similarity contrastive loss function that generalizes cosine similarity
contrastive loss for variational few-shot inference scenarios. Our approach
also achieves superior image reconstruction quality with a FID score of 2.75,
outperforming traditional VAE (3.43) and WAE (3.38) approaches. Extensive
experiments conducted on four few-shot benchmarked datasets verify that
ANROT-HELANet's combination of Hellinger distance-based feature aggregation,
attention mechanisms, and our novel loss function establishes new
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness against both
adversarial and natural perturbations. Our code repository will be available at

Title: MIS-LSTM: Multichannel Image-Sequence LSTM for Sleep Quality and Stress
  Prediction
Authors: Seongwan Park, Jieun Woo, and Siheon Yang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: ICTC 2025
\\
  This paper presents MIS-LSTM, a hybrid framework that joins CNN encoders with
an LSTM sequence model for sleep quality and stress prediction at the day level
from multimodal lifelog data. Continuous sensor streams are first partitioned
into N-hour blocks and rendered as multi-channel images, while sparse discrete
events are encoded with a dedicated 1D-CNN. A Convolutional Block Attention
Module fuses the two modalities into refined block embeddings, which an LSTM
then aggregates to capture long-range temporal dependencies. To further boost
robustness, we introduce UALRE, an uncertainty-aware ensemble that overrides
lowconfidence majority votes with high-confidence individual predictions.
Experiments on the 2025 ETRI Lifelog Challenge dataset show that Our base
MISLSTM achieves Macro-F1 0.615; with the UALRE ensemble, the score improves to
0.647, outperforming strong LSTM, 1D-CNN, and CNN baselines. Ablations confirm
(i) the superiority of multi-channel over stacked-vertical imaging, (ii) the
benefit of a 4-hour block granularity, and (iii) the efficacy of
modality-specific discrete encoding.

Title: Contextualized Multimodal Lifelong Person Re-Identification in Hybrid
  Clothing States
Authors: Robert Long, Rongxin Jiang, Mingrui Yan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Person Re-Identification (ReID) has several challenges in real-world
surveillance systems due to clothing changes (CCReID) and the need for
maintaining continual learning (LReID). Previous existing methods either
develop models specifically for one application, which is mostly a same-cloth
(SC) setting or treat CCReID as its own separate sub-problem. In this work, we
will introduce the LReID-Hybrid task with the goal of developing a model to
achieve both SC and CC while learning in a continual setting. Mismatched
representations and forgetting from one task to the next are significant
issues, we address this with CMLReID, a CLIP-based framework composed of two
novel tasks: (1) Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) that generates adaptive
prompts, and also incorporates context to align richly multi-grained visual
cues with semantic text space; and (2) Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection
(AKFP) which produces robust SC/CC prototypes through the use of a dual-path
learner that aligns features with our Clothing-State-Aware Projection Loss.
Experiments performed on a wide range of datasets and illustrate that CMLReID
outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with strong robustness and
generalization despite clothing variations and a sophisticated process of
sequential learning.

Title: Cross-Domain Attribute Alignment with CLIP: A Rehearsal-Free Approach
  for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Authors: Kerun Mi, Guoliang Kang, Guangyu Li, Lin Zhao, Tao Zhou, Chen Gong
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to ACM MM 2025
\\
  Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a
model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the
sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint
and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in
avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes
during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works
cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store
and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid
catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between
classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will
continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in
knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve
domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task.
Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we
name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent
an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value
is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each
corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across
domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention
consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and
cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting
while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on
three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

Title: Synthetic Dataset Evaluation Based on Generalized Cross Validation

\\
  With the rapid advancement of synthetic dataset generation techniques,
evaluating the quality of synthetic data has become a critical research focus.
Robust evaluation not only drives innovations in data generation methods but
also guides researchers in optimizing the utilization of these synthetic
resources. However, current evaluation studies for synthetic datasets remain
limited, lacking a universally accepted standard framework. To address this,
this paper proposes a novel evaluation framework integrating generalized
cross-validation experiments and domain transfer learning principles, enabling
generalizable and comparable assessments of synthetic dataset quality. The
framework involves training task-specific models (e.g., YOLOv5s) on both
synthetic datasets and multiple real-world benchmarks (e.g., KITTI, BDD100K),
forming a cross-performance matrix. Following normalization, a Generalized
Cross-Validation (GCV) Matrix is constructed to quantify domain
transferability. The framework introduces two key metrics. One measures the
simulation quality by quantifying the similarity between synthetic data and
real-world datasets, while another evaluates the transfer quality by assessing
the diversity and coverage of synthetic data across various real-world
scenarios. Experimental validation on Virtual KITTI demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed framework and metrics in assessing synthetic data
fidelity. This scalable and quantifiable evaluation solution overcomes
traditional limitations, providing a principled approach to guide synthetic
dataset optimization in artificial intelligence research.

Title: ROSGS: Relightable Outdoor Scenes With Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Lianjun Liao, Chunhui Zhang, Tong Wu, Henglei Lv, Bailin Deng, Lin Gao
Categories: cs.CV
ACM-class: I.2.10; I.3
\\
  Image data captured outdoors often exhibit unbounded scenes and
unconstrained, varying lighting conditions, making it challenging to decompose
them into geometry, reflectance, and illumination. Recent works have focused on
achieving this decomposition using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or the 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation but remain hindered by two key
limitations: the high computational overhead associated with neural networks of
NeRF and the use of low-frequency lighting representations, which often result
in inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy. We propose ROSGS,
a two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor
scenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular
normal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and
accurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS
then decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting
model. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing
a spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency
components of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via
Spherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight
comprehensively. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons
demonstrate that ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting
outdoor scenes and highlight its ability to deliver superior relighting
accuracy and rendering efficiency.

Title: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by
  Self-Injecting Hallucinations
Authors: Yifan Lu, Ziqi Zhang, Chunfeng Yuan, Jun Gao, Congxuan Zhang, Xiaojuan
  Qi, Bing Li, Weiming Hu
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
Comments: emnlp 2025 accepted
\\
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination
problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual
inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on
preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models
for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable
improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference
Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that
mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the
target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a
pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection
process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key
observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination
patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination
mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training
strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the
preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous
enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that
APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models
but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based
methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and
generalization capability. The code is available at
https://github.com/davidluciolu/APASI.

Title: Leveraging Geometric Priors for Unaligned Scene Change Detection
Authors: Ziling Liu, Ziwei Chen, Mingqi Gao, Jinyu Yang, Feng Zheng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Unaligned Scene Change Detection aims to detect scene changes between image
pairs captured at different times without assuming viewpoint alignment. To
handle viewpoint variations, current methods rely solely on 2D visual cues to
establish cross-image correspondence to assist change detection. However, large
viewpoint changes can alter visual observations, causing appearance-based
matching to drift or fail. Additionally, supervision limited to 2D change masks
from small-scale SCD datasets restricts the learning of generalizable
multi-view knowledge, making it difficult to reliably identify visual overlaps
and handle occlusions. This lack of explicit geometric reasoning represents a
critical yet overlooked limitation. In this work, we are the first to leverage
geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model to address the core
challenges of unaligned SCD, including reliable identification of visual
overlaps, robust correspondence establishment, and explicit occlusion
detection. Building on these priors, we propose a training-free framework that
integrates them with the powerful representations of a visual foundation model
to enable reliable change detection under viewpoint misalignment. Through
extensive evaluation on the PSCD, ChangeSim, and PASLCD datasets, we
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior and robust performance. Our
code will be released at https://github.com/ZilingLiu/GeoSCD.

Title: UnLoc: Leveraging Depth Uncertainties for Floorplan Localization
Authors: Matthias W\"uest, Francis Engelmann, Ondrej Miksik, Marc Pollefeys,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We propose UnLoc, an efficient data-driven solution for sequential camera
localization within floorplans. Floorplan data is readily available, long-term
persistent, and robust to changes in visual appearance. We address key
limitations of recent methods, such as the lack of uncertainty modeling in
depth predictions and the necessity for custom depth networks trained for each
environment. We introduce a novel probabilistic model that incorporates
uncertainty estimation, modeling depth predictions as explicit probability
distributions. By leveraging off-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth models,
we eliminate the need to rely on per-environment-trained depth networks,
enhancing generalization to unseen spaces. We evaluate UnLoc on large-scale
synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over
existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Notably, we achieve $2.7$
times higher localization recall on long sequences (100 frames) and $16.7$
times higher on short ones (15 frames) than the state of the art on the
challenging LaMAR HGE dataset.

Title: Motion Estimation for Multi-Object Tracking using KalmanNet with
  Semantic-Independent Encoding
Authors: Jian Song, Wei Mei, Yunfeng Xu, Qiang Fu, Renke Kou, Lina Bu and
  Yucheng Long
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT).
  It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their
positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and
identity switches.
  The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of
the most commonly used methods in MOT.
  However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are
mismatched and objects move in non-stationary.
  In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion
estimation of MOT.
  In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet
(SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a
Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps.
  First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves
along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state
vectors to encode independent semantic information.
  Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to
encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between
heterogeneous-semantic elements.
  To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in
MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several
open-source MOT datasets.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the
traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing
learning-aided filters.

Title: Toward Next-generation Medical Vision Backbones: Modeling Finer-grained
  Long-range Visual Dependency
Authors: Mingyuan Meng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Invited as Long Oral Presentation (Top 8) at MICCAI 2025 Doctoral
  Consortium
\\
  Medical Image Computing (MIC) is a broad research topic covering both
pixel-wise (e.g., segmentation, registration) and image-wise (e.g.,
classification, regression) vision tasks. Effective analysis demands models
that capture both global long-range context and local subtle visual
characteristics, necessitating fine-grained long-range visual dependency
modeling. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are limited by
intrinsic locality, transformers excel at long-range modeling; however, due to
the high computational loads of self-attention, transformers typically cannot
process high-resolution features (e.g., full-scale image features before
downsampling or patch embedding) and thus face difficulties in modeling
fine-grained dependency among subtle medical image details. Concurrently,
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based visual models are recognized as
computation/memory-efficient alternatives in modeling long-range visual
dependency but have yet to be widely investigated in the MIC community. This
doctoral research advances deep learning-based MIC by investigating effective
long-range visual dependency modeling. It first presents innovative use of
transformers for both pixel- and image-wise medical vision tasks. The focus
then shifts to MLPs, pioneeringly developing MLP-based visual models to capture
fine-grained long-range visual dependency in medical images. Extensive
experiments confirm the critical role of long-range dependency modeling in MIC
and reveal a key finding: MLPs provide feasibility in modeling finer-grained
long-range dependency among higher-resolution medical features containing
enriched anatomical/pathological details. This finding establishes MLPs as a
superior paradigm over transformers/CNNs, consistently enhancing performance
across various medical vision tasks and paving the way for next-generation
medical vision backbones.

Title: Dual Band Video Thermography Near Ambient Conditions
Authors: Sriram Narayanan, Mani Ramanagopal and Srinivasa G. Narasimhan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Long-wave infrared radiation captured by a thermal camera consists of two
components: (a) light from the environment reflected or transmitted by a
surface, and (b) light emitted by the surface after undergoing heat transport
through the object and exchanging heat with the surrounding environment.
Separating these components is essential for understanding object properties
such as emissivity, temperature, reflectance and shape. Previous thermography
studies often assume that only one component is dominant (e.g., in welding) or
that the second component is constant and can be subtracted. However, in
near-ambient conditions, which are most relevant to computer vision
applications, both components are typically comparable in magnitude and vary
over time. We introduce the first method that separates reflected and emitted
components of light in videos captured by two thermal cameras with different
spectral sensitivities. We derive a dual-band thermal image formation model and
develop algorithms to estimate the surface's emissivity and its time-varying
temperature while isolating a dynamic background. We quantitatively evaluate
our approach using carefully calibrated emissivities for a range of materials
and show qualitative results on complex everyday scenes, such as a glass filled
with hot liquid and people moving in the background.

Comments: Published in TMLR. Review: https://openreview.net/forum?id=urWCU3YMA0

\\
  Self-supervised learning (SSL) conventionally relies on the instance
consistency paradigm, assuming that different views of the same image can be
treated as positive pairs. However, this assumption breaks down for non-iconic
data, where different views may contain distinct objects or semantic
information. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SSL when
instance consistency is not guaranteed. Through extensive ablation studies, we
demonstrate that SSL can still learn meaningful representations even when
positive pairs lack strict instance consistency. Furthermore, our analysis
further reveals that increasing view diversity, by enforcing zero overlapping
or using smaller crop scales, can enhance downstream performance on
classification and dense prediction tasks. However, excessive diversity is
found to reduce effectiveness, suggesting an optimal range for view diversity.
To quantify this, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as an estimator to
measure mutual information between views, finding that moderate EMD values
correlate with improved SSL learning, providing insights for future SSL
framework design. We validate our findings across a range of settings,
highlighting their robustness and applicability on diverse data sources.

Title: Promoting Shape Bias in CNNs: Frequency-Based and Contrastive
  Regularization for Corruption Robustness
Authors: Robin Narsingh Ranabhat, Longwei Wang, Amit Kumar Patel, KC santosh
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 12pages, 4 figures
\\
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image classification but remain
vulnerable to common corruptions that humans handle with ease. A key reason for
this fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global
object shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we
propose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage
shape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an
auxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and
low-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency
textures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure
the feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations.
Evaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption
robustness without degrading clean accuracy. Our results suggest that
loss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware,
resilient representations.

Title: GLaVE-Cap: Global-Local Aligned Video Captioning with Vision Expert
  Integration
Authors: Wan Xu, Feng Zhu, Yihan Zeng, Yuanfan Guo, Ming Liu, Hang Xu, Wangmeng

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Video detailed captioning aims to generate comprehensive video descriptions
to facilitate video understanding. Recently, most efforts in the video detailed
captioning community have been made towards a local-to-global paradigm, which
first generates local captions from video clips and then summarizes them into a
global caption. However, we find this paradigm leads to less detailed and
contextual-inconsistent captions, which can be attributed to (1) no mechanism
to ensure fine-grained captions, and (2) weak interaction between local and
global captions. To remedy the above two issues, we propose GLaVE-Cap, a
Global-Local aligned framework with Vision Expert integration for Captioning,
which consists of two core modules: TrackFusion enables comprehensive local
caption generation, by leveraging vision experts to acquire cross-frame visual
prompts, coupled with a dual-stream structure; while CaptionBridge establishes
a local-global interaction, by using global context to guide local captioning,
and adaptively summarizing local captions into a coherent global caption.
Besides, we construct GLaVE-Bench, a comprehensive video captioning benchmark
featuring 5X more queries per video than existing benchmarks, covering diverse
visual dimensions to facilitate reliable evaluation. We further provide a
training dataset GLaVE-1.2M containing 16K high-quality fine-grained video
captions and 1.2M related question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks show that our GLaVE-Cap achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Besides, the ablation studies and student model analyses further validate the
effectiveness of the proposed modules and the contribution of GLaVE-1.2M to the
video understanding community. The source code, model weights, benchmark, and
dataset will be open-sourced.

  We present MixANT, a novel architecture for stochastic long-term dense
anticipation of human activities. While recent State Space Models (SSMs) like
Mamba have shown promise through input-dependent selectivity on three key
parameters, the critical forget-gate ($\textbf{A}$ matrix) controlling temporal
memory remains static. We address this limitation by introducing a mixture of
experts approach that dynamically selects contextually relevant $\textbf{A}$
matrices based on input features, enhancing representational capacity without
sacrificing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the 50Salads,
Breakfast, and Assembly101 datasets demonstrate that MixANT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation settings. Our
results highlight the importance of input-dependent forget-gate mechanisms for
reliable prediction of human behavior in diverse real-world scenarios.

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at MICCAI2025 ML-CDS Workshop
\\
  In real world clinical environments, training and applying deep learning
models on multi-modal medical imaging data often struggles with partially
incomplete data. Standard approaches either discard missing samples, require
imputation or repurpose dropout learning schemes, limiting robustness and
generalizability. To address this, we propose a hypernetwork-based method that
dynamically generates task-specific classification models conditioned on the
set of available modalities. Instead of training a fixed model, a hypernetwork
learns to predict the parameters of a task model adapted to available
modalities, enabling training and inference on all samples, regardless of
completeness. We compare this approach with (1) models trained only on complete
data, (2) state of the art channel dropout methods, and (3) an imputation-based
method, using artificially incomplete datasets to systematically analyze
robustness to missing modalities. Results demonstrate superior adaptability of
our method, outperforming state of the art approaches with an absolute increase
in accuracy of up to 8% when trained on a dataset with 25% completeness (75% of
training data with missing modalities). By enabling a single model to
generalize across all modality configurations, our approach provides an
efficient solution for real-world multi-modal medical data analysis.

Title: On the Skinning of Gaussian Avatars

Categories: cs.CV cs.GR
\\
  Radiance field-based methods have recently been used to reconstruct human
avatars, showing that we can significantly downscale the systems needed for
creating animated human avatars. Although this progress has been initiated by
neural radiance fields, their slow rendering and backward mapping from the
observation space to the canonical space have been the main challenges. With
Gaussian splatting overcoming both challenges, a new family of approaches has
emerged that are faster to train and render, while also straightforward to
implement using forward skinning from the canonical to the observation space.
However, the linear blend skinning required for the deformation of the
Gaussians does not provide valid results for their non-linear rotation
properties. To address such artifacts, recent works use mesh properties to
rotate the non-linear Gaussian properties or train models to predict corrective
offsets. Instead, we propose a weighted rotation blending approach that
leverages quaternion averaging. This leads to simpler vertex-based Gaussians
that can be efficiently animated and integrated in any engine by only modifying
the linear blend skinning technique, and using any Gaussian rasterizer.

  Identifying new disease-related patterns in medical imaging data with the
help of machine learning enlarges the vocabulary of rec- ognizable findings.
This supports diagnostic and prognostic assessment. However, image appearance
varies not only due to biological differences, but also due to imaging
technology linked to vendors, scanning- or re- construction parameters. The
resulting domain shifts impedes data rep- resentation learning strategies and
the discovery of biologically mean- ingful cluster appearances. To address
these challenges, we introduce an approach to actively learn the domain shift
via post-hoc rotation of the data latent space, enabling disentanglement of
biological and tech- nical factors. Results on real-world heterogeneous
clinical data show- case that the learned disentangled representation leads to
stable clus- ters representing tissue-types across different acquisition
settings. Clus- ter consistency is improved by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI),
and +12.39% (Dice) compared to the entangled representation, outperform- ing
four state-of-the-art harmonization methods. When using the clus- ters to
quantify tissue composition on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis pa- tients, the
learned profiles enhance Cox survival prediction. This indi- cates that the
proposed label-free framework facilitates biomarker dis- covery in multi-center
routine imaging data. Code is available on GitHub

Title: MultiMAE for Brain MRIs: Robustness to Missing Inputs Using Multi-Modal

\\
  Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing a
challenge for deep learning models reliant on complete input data. In this
work, inspired by MultiMAE [2], we develop a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm
for multi-modal, multi-task learning in 3D medical imaging with brain MRIs. Our
method treats each MRI sequence as a separate input modality, leveraging a
late-fusion-style transformer encoder to integrate multi-sequence information
(multi-modal) and individual decoder streams for each modality for multi-task
reconstruction. This pretraining strategy guides the model to learn rich
representations per modality while also equipping it to handle missing inputs
through cross-sequence reasoning. The result is a flexible and generalizable
encoder for brain MRIs that infers missing sequences from available inputs and
can be adapted to various downstream applications. We demonstrate the
performance and robustness of our method against an MAE-ViT baseline in
downstream segmentation and classification tasks, showing absolute improvement
of $10.1$ overall Dice score and $0.46$ MCC over the baselines with missing
input sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the strength of this pretraining
strategy. The implementation is made available.

Title: Beyond Frame-wise Tracking: A Trajectory-based Paradigm for Efficient
  Point Cloud Tracking
Authors: BaiChen Fan, Sifan Zhou, Jian Li, Shibo Zhao, Muqing Cao, Qin Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.RO
Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures
\\
  LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics
and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion
estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are
efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse
or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point
clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this
dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation,
TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame
tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box
trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It
first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit
motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines
and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale
NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong
baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong
generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers. Video is

  Data Mining (ICCVDM 2025)
\\
  Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a fundamental task in multi-modal
perception that aims to integrate complementary structural and textural cues
from different spectral domains. In this paper, we propose FusionNet, a novel
end-to-end fusion framework that explicitly models inter-modality interaction
and enhances task-critical regions. FusionNet introduces a modality-aware
attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of infrared and
visible features based on their discriminative capacity. To achieve
fine-grained, interpretable fusion, we further incorporate a pixel-wise alpha
blending module, which learns spatially-varying fusion weights in an adaptive
and content-aware manner. Moreover, we formulate a target-aware loss that
leverages weak ROI supervision to preserve semantic consistency in regions
containing important objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Experiments on the
public M3FD dataset demonstrate that FusionNet generates fused images with
enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear
interpretability. Our framework provides a general and extensible solution for
semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion, with benefits for downstream tasks
such as object detection and scene understanding.

Title: Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining
  for Gigapixel Histopathology Image Analysis
Authors: Wenhao Tang, Sheng Huang, Heng Fang, Fengtao Zhou, Bo Liu, Qingshan

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 27 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has
opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue
comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via
attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify
instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that
hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.
Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework
with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure
with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a
class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask
salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student
model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale
random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of
losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an
exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent
training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer
diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate
that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and
efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/MHIM-MIL.

  Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment objects that blend into
their surroundings. However, most existing studies overlook the semantic
differences among textual prompts of different targets as well as fine-grained
frequency features. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic and Frequency
Guided Network (SFGNet), which incorporates semantic prompts and
frequency-domain features to capture camouflaged objects and improve boundary
perception. We further design Multi-Band Fourier Module(MBFM) to enhance the
ability of the network in handling complex backgrounds and blurred boundaries.
In addition, we design an Interactive Structure Enhancement Block (ISEB) to
ensure structural integrity and boundary details in the predictions. Extensive
experiments conducted on three COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The core code of
the model is available at the following link:

Title: How Auxiliary Reasoning Unleashes GUI Grounding in VLMs
Authors: Weiming Li, Yan Shao, Jing Yang, Yujing Lu, Ling Zhong, Yuhan Wang and
  Manni Duan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a fundamental task for building
GUI agents. However, general vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with this
task due to a lack of specific optimization. We identify a key gap in this
paper: while VLMs exhibit significant latent grounding potential, as
demonstrated by their performance measured by Pointing Game, they underperform
when tasked with outputting explicit coordinates. To address this discrepancy,
and bypass the high data and annotation costs of current fine-tuning
approaches, we propose three zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods. By
providing explicit spatial cues such as axes, grids and labeled intersections
as part of the input image, these methods enable VLMs to articulate their
implicit spatial understanding capabilities. We evaluate these methods on four
GUI grounding benchmarks across seven open-source and proprietary VLMs. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed methods substantially improve
the performance of GUI grounding.

Title: Gaussian-Plus-SDF SLAM: High-fidelity 3D Reconstruction at 150+ fps
Authors: Zhexi Peng, Kun Zhou, Tianjia Shao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  While recent Gaussian-based SLAM methods achieve photorealistic
reconstruction from RGB-D data, their computational performance remains a
critical bottleneck. State-of-the-art techniques operate at less than 20 fps,
significantly lagging behind geometry-centric approaches like KinectFusion
(hundreds of fps). This limitation stems from the heavy computational burden:
modeling scenes requires numerous Gaussians and complex iterative optimization
to fit RGB-D data, where insufficient Gaussian counts or optimization
iterations cause severe quality degradation. To address this, we propose a
Gaussian-SDF hybrid representation, combining a colorized Signed Distance Field
(SDF) for smooth geometry and appearance with 3D Gaussians to capture
underrepresented details. The SDF is efficiently constructed via RGB-D fusion
(as in geometry-centric methods), while Gaussians undergo iterative
optimization. Our representation enables drastic Gaussian reduction (50% fewer)
by avoiding full-scene Gaussian modeling, and efficient Gaussian optimization
(75% fewer iterations) through targeted appearance refinement. Building upon
this representation, we develop GPS-SLAM (Gaussian-Plus-SDF SLAM), a real-time
3D reconstruction system achieving over 150 fps on real-world Azure Kinect
sequences -- delivering an order-of-magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art
techniques while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality. We will release
the source code and data to facilitate future research.

Title: Hierarchical Identity Learning for Unsupervised Visible-Infrared Person
  Re-Identification
Authors: Haonan Shi, Yubin Wang, De Cheng, Lingfeng He, Nannan Wang, Xinbo Gao
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to
learn modality-invariant image features from unlabeled cross-modal person
datasets by reducing the modality gap while minimizing reliance on costly
manual annotations. Existing methods typically address USVI-ReID using
cluster-based contrastive learning, which represents a person by a single
cluster center. However, they primarily focus on the commonality of images
within each cluster while neglecting the finer-grained differences among them.
To address the limitation, we propose a Hierarchical Identity Learning (HIL)
framework. Since each cluster may contain several smaller sub-clusters that
reflect fine-grained variations among images, we generate multiple memories for
each existing coarse-grained cluster via a secondary clustering. Additionally,
we propose Multi-Center Contrastive Learning (MCCL) to refine representations
for enhancing intra-modal clustering and minimizing cross-modal discrepancies.
To further improve cross-modal matching quality, we design a Bidirectional
Reverse Selection Transmission (BRST) mechanism, which establishes reliable
cross-modal correspondences by performing bidirectional matching of
pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments conducted on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.

Title: Optimizing Class Distributions for Bias-Aware Multi-Class Learning
Authors: Mirco Felske, Stefan Stiene
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: This paper has been accepted for the upcoming 59th Hawaii
  International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS-59)
\\
  We propose BiCDO (Bias-Controlled Class Distribution Optimizer), an
iterative, data-centric framework that identifies Pareto optimized class
distributions for multi-class image classification. BiCDO enables performance
prioritization for specific classes, which is useful in safety-critical
scenarios (e.g. prioritizing 'Human' over 'Dog'). Unlike uniform distributions,
BiCDO determines the optimal number of images per class to enhance reliability
and minimize bias and variance in the objective function. BiCDO can be
incorporated into existing training pipelines with minimal code changes and
supports any labelled multi-class dataset. We have validated BiCDO using
EfficientNet, ResNet and ConvNeXt on CIFAR-10 and iNaturalist21 datasets,
demonstrating improved, balanced model performance through optimized data
distribution.

Title: MVQA-68K: A Multi-dimensional and Causally-annotated Dataset with
  Quality Interpretability for Video Assessment
Authors: Yanyun Pu, Kehan Li, Zeyi Huang, Zhijie Zhong, Kaixiang Yang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Sora, video
quality assessment (VQA) is becoming increasingly crucial for selecting
high-quality videos from large-scale datasets used in pre-training. Traditional
VQA methods, typically producing single numerical scores, often lack
comprehensiveness and interpretability. To address these challenges, we
introduce MVQA-68K, a novel multi-dimensional VQA dataset comprising over
68,000 carefully annotated videos, covering seven essential quality dimensions:
overall aesthetics, camera movement, dynamic degree, texture detail,
composition, visual quality, and factual consistency. Each annotation includes
detailed chain-of-thought reasoning to facilitate interpretability and
comprehensive understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVQA-68K
significantly enhances the performance of various multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) on the VQA task, achieving state-of-the-art results not only on
our internal test set (Fig.1) but also on public benchmarks including
LSVQ-test, LSVQ-1080p, and LIVE-VQC. Meantime, incorporating explicit reasoning
process during VQA training substantially boosts the zero-shot generalization.

Title: Disentangling Content from Style to Overcome Shortcut Learning: A Hybrid
  Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework
Authors: Siming Fu, Sijun Dong, Xiaoliang Meng
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Despite the remarkable success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), its
generalization is fundamentally hindered by Shortcut Learning, where models
exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure. We
experimentally verify this flaw within the generative paradigm (e.g., MAE) and
argue it is a systemic issue also affecting discriminative methods, identifying
it as the root cause of their failure on unseen domains. While existing methods
often tackle this at a surface level by aligning or separating domain-specific
features, they fail to alter the underlying learning mechanism that fosters
shortcut dependency. To address this at its core, we propose HyGDL (Hybrid
Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework), a hybrid framework that achieves
explicit content-style disentanglement. Our approach is guided by the
Invariance Pre-training Principle: forcing a model to learn an invariant
essence by systematically varying a bias (e.g., style) at the input while
keeping the supervision signal constant. HyGDL operates on a single encoder and
analytically defines style as the component of a representation that is
orthogonal to its style-invariant content, derived via vector projection.

  Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is critical for surveillance and public safety.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level
tasks, restricting a holistic view of model generalization. This work first
introduces a softmax-based frame allocation strategy that prioritizes
anomaly-dense segments while maintaining full-video coverage, enabling balanced
sampling across temporal scales. Building on this process, we construct two
complementary benchmarks. The image-based benchmark evaluates frame-level
reasoning with representative frames, while the video-based benchmark extends
to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring
task.Experiments on UCF-Crime demonstrate improvements at both the frame and
video levels, and ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused
sampling over uniform and random baselines.

Title: A Controllable 3D Deepfake Generation Framework with Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Wending Liu, Siyun Liang, Huy H. Nguyen, Isao Echizen
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Journal-ref: Proc. International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB), 2025
\\
  We propose a novel 3D deepfake generation framework based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting that enables realistic, identity-preserving face swapping and
reenactment in a fully controllable 3D space. Compared to conventional 2D
deepfake approaches that suffer from geometric inconsistencies and limited
generalization to novel view, our method combines a parametric head model with
dynamic Gaussian representations to support multi-view consistent rendering,
precise expression control, and seamless background integration. To address
editing challenges in point-based representations, we explicitly separate the
head and background Gaussians and use pre-trained 2D guidance to optimize the
facial region across views. We further introduce a repair module to enhance
visual consistency under extreme poses and expressions. Experiments on
NeRSemble and additional evaluation videos demonstrate that our method achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art 2D approaches in identity
preservation, as well as pose and expression consistency, while significantly
outperforming them in multi-view rendering quality and 3D consistency. Our
approach bridges the gap between 3D modeling and deepfake synthesis, enabling
new directions for scene-aware, controllable, and immersive visual forgeries,
revealing the threat that emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting technique could be
used for manipulation attacks.

Title: IS-Diff: Improving Diffusion-Based Inpainting with Better Initial Seed
Authors: Yongzhe Lyu, Yu Wu, Yutian Lin and Bo Du
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Diffusion models have shown promising results in free-form inpainting. Recent
studies based on refined diffusion samplers or novel architectural designs led
to realistic results and high data consistency. However, random initialization
seed (noise) adopted in vanilla diffusion process may introduce mismatched
semantic information in masked regions, leading to biased inpainting results,
e.g., low consistency and low coherence with the other unmasked area. To
address this issue, we propose the Initial Seed refined Diffusion Model
(IS-Diff), a completely training-free approach incorporating distributional
harmonious seeds to produce harmonious results. Specifically, IS-Diff employs
initial seeds sampled from unmasked areas to imitate the masked data
distribution, thereby setting a promising direction for the diffusion
procedure. Moreover, a dynamic selective refinement mechanism is proposed to
detect severe unharmonious inpaintings in intermediate latent and adjust the
strength of our initialization prior dynamically. We validate our method on
both standard and large-mask inpainting tasks using the CelebA-HQ, ImageNet,
and Places2 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness across all metrics
compared to state-of-the-art inpainting methods.

Comments: Accepted by ACMMM 2025 Datasets Track
\\
  Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches, which aim to handle
multiple weather degradations within a single framework, are predominantly
trained and evaluated using mixed single-weather synthetic datasets. However,
these datasets often differ significantly in resolution, style, and domain
characteristics, leading to substantial domain gaps that hinder the development
and fair evaluation of unified models. Furthermore, the lack of a large-scale,
real-world all-in-one weather restoration dataset remains a critical bottleneck
in advancing this field. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
all-in-one adverse weather image restoration benchmark dataset, which contains
image pairs captured under various weather conditions, including rain, snow,
and haze, as well as diverse outdoor scenes and illumination settings. The
resulting dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images,
enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of task-specific, task-general, and
all-in-one restoration methods on our dataset. Our dataset offers a valuable
foundation for advancing robust and practical all-in-one image restoration in
real-world scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released and is available

  OCTA is a crucial non-invasive imaging technique for diagnosing and

  Fine-Grained Dirty Tableware Recognition
Authors: Lifei Hao and Yue Cheng and Baoqi Huang and Bing Jia and Xuandong Zhao
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Intelligent tableware cleaning is a critical application in food safety and
smart homes, but existing methods are limited by coarse-grained classification
and scarcity of few-shot data, making it difficult to meet industrialization
requirements. We propose DTGen, a few-shot data augmentation scheme based on
generative diffusion models, specifically designed for fine-grained dirty
tableware recognition. DTGen achieves efficient domain specialization through
LoRA, generates diverse dirty images via structured prompts, and ensures data
quality through CLIP-based cross-modal filtering. Under extremely limited real
few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize virtually unlimited high-quality
samples, significantly improving classifier performance and supporting
fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. We further elaborate on lightweight
deployment strategies, promising to transfer DTGen's benefits to embedded
dishwashers and integrate with cleaning programs to intelligently regulate
energy consumption and detergent usage. Research results demonstrate that DTGen
not only validates the value of generative AI in few-shot industrial vision but
also provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and
food safety monitoring.

Title: MindVL: Towards Efficient and Effective Training of Multimodal Large
  Language Models on Ascend NPUs
Authors: Feilong Chen, Yijiang Liu, Yi Huang, Hao Wang, Miren Tian, Ya-Qi Yu,
  Minghui Liao and Jihao Wu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL eess.IV
\\
  We propose MindVL, a multimodal large langauge model trained on Ascend NPUs.
Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers,
which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This
design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while
preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for
visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the
smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a
distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain
training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators.
MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase,
multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually
enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal
pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction
tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism
techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further
boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search
and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training
data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL
in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table
comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance

Title: RouteExtract: A Modular Pipeline for Extracting Routes from Paper Maps
Authors: Bjoern Kremser, Yusuke Matsui

  Generation (GDUG) at ICCV 2025. 8 pages, 7 figures

  Paper maps remain widely used for hiking and sightseeing because they contain
curated trails and locally relevant annotations that are often missing from
digital navigation applications such as Google Maps. We propose a pipeline to
extract navigable trails from scanned maps, enabling their use in GPS-based
navigation. Our method combines georeferencing, U-Net-based binary
segmentation, graph construction, and an iterative refinement procedure using a
routing engine. We evaluate the full end-to-end pipeline as well as individual
components, showing that the approach can robustly recover trail networks from
diverse map styles and generate GPS routes suitable for practical use.

Title: IMD: A 6-DoF Pose Estimation Benchmark for Industrial Metallic Objects
Authors: Ruimin Ma, Sebastian Zudaire, Zhen Li, Chi Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 19 figures, 2 tables. Accepted in 2025 8th International
  Conference on Robotics, Control and Automation Engineering (RCAE 2025)
\\
  Object 6DoF (6D) pose estimation is essential for robotic perception,
especially in industrial settings. It enables robots to interact with the
environment and manipulate objects. However, existing benchmarks on object 6D
pose estimation primarily use everyday objects with rich textures and
low-reflectivity, limiting model generalization to industrial scenarios where
objects are often metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective. To address
this gap, we propose a novel dataset and benchmark namely \textit{Industrial
Metallic Dataset (IMD)}, tailored for industrial applications. Our dataset
comprises 45 true-to-scale industrial components, captured with an RGB-D camera
under natural indoor lighting and varied object arrangements to replicate
real-world conditions. The benchmark supports three tasks, including video
object segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot 6D pose estimation. We
evaluate existing state-of-the-art models, including XMem and SAM2 for
segmentation, and BundleTrack and BundleSDF for pose estimation, to assess
model performance in industrial contexts. Evaluation results show that our
industrial dataset is more challenging than existing household object datasets.
This benchmark provides the baseline for developing and comparing segmentation
and pose estimation algorithms that better generalize to industrial robotics
scenarios.

Title: Uncertainty-Aware Retinal Vessel Segmentation via Ensemble Distillation
Authors: Jeremiah Fadugba, Petru Manescu, Bolanle Oladejo, Delmiro
  Fernandez-Reyes, Philipp Berens
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 5 pages, 5 figure
\\
  Uncertainty estimation is critical for reliable medical image segmentation,
particularly in retinal vessel analysis, where accurate predictions are
essential for diagnostic applications. Deep Ensembles, where multiple networks
are trained individually, are widely used to improve medical image segmentation
performance. However, training and testing costs increase with the number of
ensembles. In this work, we propose Ensemble Distillation as a robust
alternative to commonly used uncertainty estimation techniques by distilling
the knowledge of multiple ensemble models into a single model. Through
extensive experiments on the DRIVE and FIVES datasets, we demonstrate that
Ensemble Distillation achieves comparable performance via calibration and
segmentation metrics, while significantly reducing computational complexity.
These findings suggest that Ensemble distillation provides an efficient and
reliable approach for uncertainty estimation in the segmentation of the retinal
vessels, making it a promising tool for medical imaging applications.

Title: The Quest for Universal Master Key Filters in DS-CNNs
Authors: Zahra Babaiee, Peyman M. Kiassari, Daniela Rus, Radu Grosu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  A recent study has proposed the "Master Key Filters Hypothesis" for
convolutional neural network filters. This paper extends this hypothesis by
radically constraining its scope to a single set of just 8 universal filters
that depthwise separable convolutional networks inherently converge to. While
conventional DS-CNNs employ thousands of distinct trained filters, our analysis
reveals these filters are predom- inantly linear shifts (ax+b) of our
discovered universal set. Through systematic unsupervised search, we extracted
these fundamental patterns across different architectures and datasets.
Remarkably, networks initialized with these 8 unique frozen filters achieve
over 80% ImageNet accuracy, and even outperform models with thousands of
trainable parameters when applied to smaller datasets. The identified master
key filters closely match Difference of Gaussians (DoGs), Gaussians, and their
derivatives, structures that are not only fundamental to classical image
processing but also strikingly similar to receptive fields in mammalian visual
systems. Our findings provide compelling evidence that depthwise convolutional
layers naturally gravitate toward this fundamental set of spatial operators
regardless of task or architecture. This work offers new insights for
understanding generalization and transfer learning through the universal
language of these master key filters.

  This technical report documents the development of novel Layout Analysis
models integrated into the Docling document-conversion pipeline. We trained
several state-of-the-art object detectors based on the RT-DETR, RT-DETRv2 and
DFINE architectures on a heterogeneous corpus of 150,000 documents (both openly
available and proprietary). Post-processing steps were applied to the raw
detections to make them more applicable to the document conversion task. We
evaluated the effectiveness of the layout analysis on various document
benchmarks using different methodologies while also measuring the runtime
performance across different environments (CPU, Nvidia and Apple GPUs). We
introduce five new document layout models achieving 20.6% - 23.9% mAP
improvement over Docling's previous baseline, with comparable or better
runtime. Our best model, "heron-101", attains 78% mAP with 28 ms/image
inference time on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments establish best practices for training, evaluating, and
deploying document-layout detectors, providing actionable guidance for the
document conversion community. All trained checkpoints, code, and documentation

  Accurate segmentation of thin structures is critical for microsurgical scene

class imbalance. We propose Microsurgery Instrument Segmentation for Robotic

luminance channels, integrates skip attention to preserve elongated features,
and employs an Iterative Feedback Module(IFM) for continuity restoration across
multiple passes. In addition, we introduce a dedicated microsurgical dataset
with fine-grained annotations of surgical instruments including thin objects,
providing a benchmark for robust evaluation Dataset available at

that MISRA achieves competitive performance, improving the mean class IoU by
5.37% over competing methods, while delivering more stable predictions at
instrument contacts and overlaps. These results position MISRA as a promising
step toward reliable scene parsing for computer-assisted and robotic

  Framework with Global Context for Map Inference
Authors: Yudong Shen, Wenyu Wu, Jiali Mao, Yixiao Tong, Guoping Liu, Chaoya

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Trajectory data has become a key resource for automated map in-ference due to
its low cost, broad coverage, and continuous availability. However, uneven
trajectory density often leads to frag-mented roads in sparse areas and
redundant segments in dense regions, posing significant challenges for existing
methods. To address these issues, we propose DGMap, a dual-decoding framework
with global context awareness, featuring Multi-scale Grid Encoding,
Mask-enhanced Keypoint Extraction, and Global Context-aware Relation
Prediction. By integrating global semantic context with local geometric
features, DGMap improves keypoint detection accuracy to reduce road
fragmentation in sparse-trajectory areas. Additionally, the Global
Context-aware Relation Prediction module suppresses false connections in
dense-trajectory regions by modeling long-range trajectory patterns.
Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that DGMap outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by 5% in APLS, with notable performance gains on
trajectory data from the Didi Chuxing platform

  Artificial intelligence (AI) that can effectively learn ultrasound
representations by integrating multi-source data holds significant promise for
advancing clinical care. However, the scarcity of large labeled datasets in
real-world clinical environments and the limited generalizability of
task-specific models have hindered the development of generalizable clinical AI
models for ultrasound applications. In this study, we present EchoCare, a novel
ultrasound foundation model for generalist clinical use, developed via
self-supervised learning on our curated, publicly available, large-scale
dataset EchoCareData. EchoCareData comprises 4.5 million ultrasound images,
sourced from over 23 countries across 5 continents and acquired via a diverse
range of distinct imaging devices, thus encompassing global cohorts that are
multi-center, multi-device, and multi-ethnic. Unlike prior studies that adopt
off-the-shelf vision foundation model architectures, we introduce a
hierarchical classifier into EchoCare to enable joint learning of pixel-level
and representation-level features, capturing both global anatomical contexts
and local ultrasound characteristics. With minimal training, EchoCare
outperforms state-of-the-art comparison models across 10 representative
ultrasound benchmarks of varying diagnostic difficulties, spanning disease
diagnosis, lesion segmentation, organ detection, landmark prediction,
quantitative regression, imaging enhancement and report generation. The code
and pretrained model are publicly released, rendering EchoCare accessible for
fine-tuning and local adaptation, supporting extensibility to additional
applications. EchoCare provides a fully open and generalizable foundation model
to boost the development of AI technologies for diverse clinical ultrasound

Title: MSMA: Multi-Scale Feature Fusion For Multi-Attribute 3D Face
  Reconstruction From Unconstrained Images
Authors: Danling Cao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Reconstructing 3D face from a single unconstrained image remains a
challenging problem due to diverse conditions in unconstrained environments.
Recently, learning-based methods have achieved notable results by effectively
capturing complex facial structures and details across varying conditions.
Consequently, many existing approaches employ projection-based losses between
generated and input images to constrain model training. However, learning-based
methods for 3D face reconstruction typically require substantial amounts of 3D
facial data, which is difficult and costly to obtain. Consequently, to reduce
reliance on labeled 3D face datasets, many existing approaches employ
projection-based losses between generated and input images to constrain model
training. Nonetheless, despite these advancements, existing approaches
frequently struggle to capture detailed and multi-scale features under diverse
facial attributes and conditions, leading to incomplete or less accurate
reconstructions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with
Multi-Attribute (MSMA) framework for 3D face reconstruction from unconstrained
images. Our method integrates multi-scale feature fusion with a focus on
multi-attribute learning and leverages a large-kernel attention module to
enhance the precision of feature extraction across scales, enabling accurate 3D
facial parameter estimation from a single 2D image. Comprehensive experiments
on the MICC Florence, Facewarehouse and custom-collect datasets demonstrate
that our approach achieves results on par with current state-of-the-art
methods, and in some instances, surpasses SOTA performance across challenging
conditions.

  Zero-shot Generalization
Authors: Diogo Mendon\c{c}a, Tiago Barros, Cristiano Premebida and Urbano J.
  Nunes
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Autonomous systems require robust Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) capabilities to
operate reliably in dynamic environments. MOT ensures consistent object
identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in
foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot
generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS
(MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and
memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that
integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module
to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The
proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic.
Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that
Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth
overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a
new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window
memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance
degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results
confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot
tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization. The

  Retinal vessel segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of diseases such

Although SA-UNet introduces spatial attention in the bottleneck, it underuses
attention in skip connections and does not address the severe
foreground-background imbalance. We propose SA-UNetv2, a lightweight model that
injects cross-scale spatial attention into all skip connections to strengthen
multi-scale feature fusion and adopts a weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
plus Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) loss to improve robustness to class
imbalance. On the public DRIVE and STARE datasets, SA-UNetv2 achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1.2MB memory and 0.26M parameters (less
than 50% of SA-UNet), and 1 second CPU inference on 592 x 592 x 3 images,

  Neural Training Dynamics
Authors: Ang Nan Gu, Michael Tsang, Hooman Vaseli, Purang Abolmaesumi, Teresa
  Tsang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Computer-aided diagnosis systems must make critical decisions from medical
images that are often noisy, ambiguous, or conflicting, yet today's models are
trained on overly simplistic labels that ignore diagnostic uncertainty. One-hot
labels erase inter-rater variability and force models to make overconfident
predictions, especially when faced with incomplete or artifact-laden inputs. We
address this gap by introducing a novel framework that brings uncertainty back
into the label space. Our method leverages neural network training dynamics
(NNTD) to assess the inherent difficulty of each training sample. By
aggregating and calibrating model predictions during training, we generate
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels that reflect the ambiguity encountered during
learning. This label augmentation approach is architecture-agnostic and can be
applied to any supervised learning pipeline to enhance uncertainty estimation
and robustness. We validate our approach on a challenging echocardiography
classification benchmark, demonstrating superior performance over specialized
baselines in calibration, selective classification, and multi-view fusion.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Retinal vessel segmentation is critical for the early diagnosis of
vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in real-world clinical
settings with limited computational resources. Although significant
improvements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation methods,
current models still face challenges in extracting tiny vessels and suffer from
high computational costs. In this study, we present LFRA-Net by incorporating
focal modulation attention at the encoder-decoder bottleneck and region-aware
attention in the selective skip connections. LFRA-Net is a lightweight network
optimized for precise and effective retinal vascular segmentation. It enhances
feature representation and regional focus by efficiently capturing local and
global dependencies. LFRA-Net outperformed many state-of-the-art models while
maintaining lightweight characteristics with only 0.17 million parameters, 0.66
MB memory size, and 10.50 GFLOPs. We validated it on three publicly available
datasets: DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB. It performed better in terms of Dice
score (84.28\%, 88.44\%, and 85.50\%) and Jaccard index (72.86\%, 79.31\%, and
74.70\%) on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB datasets, respectively. LFRA-Net
provides an ideal ratio between segmentation accuracy and computational cost
compared to existing deep learning methods, which makes it suitable for
real-time clinical applications in areas with limited resources. The code can

Authors: Haiduo Huang, Fuwei Yang, Zhenhua Liu, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Pengju
  Ren, Emad Barsoum
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large
language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models
(VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by
visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length,
inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We
study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system
that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering
1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2)
further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that
adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler
primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly
offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol
that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate
features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating
storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol
reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically
increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative
efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating
in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU,
consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the
target model's output distribution (lossless decoding). Our code is available

  Segmentation
Authors: Liying Wang, Xiaoli Zhang, Chuanmin Jia, Siwei Ma
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by TIP 2025
\\
  Infrared-visible image fusion methods aim at generating fused images with
good visual quality and also facilitate the performance of high-level tasks.
Indeed, existing semantic-driven methods have considered semantic information
injection for downstream applications. However, none of them investigates the
potential for reciprocal promotion between pixel-wise image fusion and
cross-modal feature fusion perception tasks from a macroscopic task-level
perspective. To address this limitation, we propose a unified network for image
fusion and semantic segmentation. MAFS is a parallel structure, containing a
fusion sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. On the one hand, We devise a
heterogeneous feature fusion strategy to enhance semantic-aware capabilities
for image fusion. On the other hand, by cascading the fusion sub-network and a
segmentation backbone, segmentation-related knowledge is transferred to promote
feature-level fusion-based segmentation. Within the framework, we design a
novel multi-stage Transformer decoder to aggregate fine-grained multi-scale
fused features efficiently. Additionally, a dynamic factor based on the max-min
fairness allocation principle is introduced to generate adaptive weights of two
tasks and guarantee smooth training in a multi-task manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results compared
with state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Semantic segmentation networks (SSNs) play a critical role in domains such as
medical imaging, autonomous driving, and environmental monitoring, where safety
hinges on reliable model behavior under uncertainty. Yet, existing
probabilistic verification approaches struggle to scale with the complexity and
dimensionality of modern segmentation tasks, often yielding guarantees that are
too conservative to be practical. We introduce a probabilistic verification
framework that is both architecture-agnostic and scalable to high-dimensional
outputs. Our approach combines sampling-based reachability analysis with
conformal inference (CI) to deliver provable guarantees while avoiding the
excessive conservatism of prior methods. To counteract CI's limitations in
high-dimensional settings, we propose novel strategies that reduce conservatism
without compromising rigor. Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation
models across CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, and Cityscapes demonstrates
that our method provides reliable safety guarantees while substantially
tightening bounds compared to SOTA. We also provide a toolbox implementing this
technique, available on Github.

VLMs, another line of research has focused on representation learning for
vision-language alignment, targeting zero-shot inference for dense tasks like
segmentation. In this work, we bridge these two directions by densely aligning
images with synthetic descriptions generated by VLMs. Synthetic captions are
inexpensive, scalable, and easy to generate, making them an excellent source of
high-level semantic understanding for dense alignment methods. Empirically, our
approach outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary

Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for camera pose estimation, an approach that

of 3D Gaussians by back-projecting every pixel into 3D space, leading to high
memory costs. We propose Segmentation-Driven Initialization for Gaussian
Splatting (SDI-GS), a method that mitigates inefficiency by leveraging
region-based segmentation to identify and retain only structurally significant
regions. This enables selective downsampling of the dense point cloud,
preserving scene fidelity while substantially reducing Gaussian count.
Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that SDI-GS reduces Gaussian count
by up to 50% and achieves comparable or superior rendering quality in PSNR and
SSIM, with only marginal degradation in LPIPS. It further enables faster
training and lower memory footprint, advancing the practicality of 3DGS for
constrained-view scenarios.

Title: Bridging Vision Language Models and Symbolic Grounding for Video
  Question Answering
Authors: Haodi Ma, Vyom Pathak, Daisy Zhe Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial,
temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs)
achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak
temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs
(SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured
object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We
introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene
graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks
(NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM
improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though
gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise
and current limitations of symbolic grounding, and offer guidance for future
hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.

  Recent advancements in large video models (LVMs) have significantly enhance
video understanding. However, these models continue to suffer from
hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address
this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive,
temporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained
spatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark
dataset Dr.V-Bench and a satellite video agent Dr.V-Agent. Dr.V-Bench includes
10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched
with detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in
LVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the
perceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This
step-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively
identifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is
effective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and
reliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in
real-world scenarios. All our data and code are available at

  Precision livestock farming requires advanced monitoring tools to meet the
increasing management needs of the industry. Computer vision systems capable of
long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral
monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object
tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific
issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among
animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types.
  While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they
often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result
in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state
estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT
and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as
DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT,
cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and
PromptTrack.
  All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results
demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools,
even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential
of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated
livestock tracking.

Title: Do It Yourself (DIY): Modifying Images for Poems in a Zero-Shot Setting
  Using Weighted Prompt Manipulation
Authors: Sofia Jamil, Kotla Sai Charan, Sriparna Saha, Koustava Goswami, K J

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Poetry is an expressive form of art that invites multiple interpretations, as
readers often bring their own emotions, experiences, and cultural backgrounds
into their understanding of a poem. Recognizing this, we aim to generate images
for poems and improve these images in a zero-shot setting, enabling audiences
to modify images as per their requirements. To achieve this, we introduce a
novel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique, which systematically
modifies attention weights and text embeddings within diffusion models. By
dynamically adjusting the importance of specific words, WPM enhances or
suppresses their influence in the final generated image, leading to
semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations. Our approach
exploits diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT in
conjunction with existing poetry datasets, ensuring a comprehensive and
structured methodology for improved image generation in the literary domain. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating weighted
prompt manipulation for enhancing imagery in poetic language.

Title: SAM-TTT: Segment Anything Model via Reverse Parameter Configuration and
  Test-Time Training for Camouflaged Object Detection
Authors: Zhenni Yu, Li Zhao, Guobao Xiao, Xiaoqin Zhang

Comments: accepted by ACM MM 25
DOI: 10.1145/3746027.3755291
\\
  This paper introduces a new Segment Anything Model (SAM) that leverages
reverse parameter configuration and test-time training to enhance its
performance on Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), named SAM-TTT. While most
existing SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting
favorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is
identified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's
semantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse
SAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the
influence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's
parameters. Building on this foundation, the T-Visioner Module is unveiled to
strengthen advantageous parameters by integrating Test-Time Training layers,
originally developed for language tasks, into vision tasks. Test-Time Training
layers represent a new class of sequence modeling layers characterized by
linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. By integrating two modules,
SAM-TTT simultaneously suppresses adverse parameters while reinforcing
advantageous ones, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD
task. Our experimental results on various COD benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting a new
benchmark in the field. The code will be available at

Authors: Francis Xiatian Zhang, Emile Mackute, Mohammadreza Kasaei, Kevin

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: The paper has been accepted to MICCAI 2025
\\
  Monocular depth estimation in bronchoscopy can significantly improve
real-time navigation accuracy and enhance the safety of interventions in
complex, branching airways. Recent advances in depth foundation models have
shown promise for endoscopic scenarios, yet these models often lack anatomical
awareness in bronchoscopy, overfitting to local textures rather than capturing
the global airway structure, particularly under ambiguous depth cues and poor
lighting. To address this, we propose Brea-Depth, a novel framework that
integrates airway-specific geometric priors into foundation model adaptation
for bronchoscopic depth estimation. Our method introduces a depth-aware
CycleGAN, refining the translation between real bronchoscopic images and airway
geometries from anatomical data, effectively bridging the domain gap. In
addition, we introduce an airway structure awareness loss to enforce depth
consistency within the airway lumen while preserving smooth transitions and
structural integrity. By incorporating anatomical priors, Brea-Depth enhances
model generalization and yields more robust, accurate 3D airway
reconstructions. To assess anatomical realism, we introduce Airway Depth
Structure Evaluation, a new metric for structural consistency. We validate
BREA-Depth on a collected ex vivo human lung dataset and an open bronchoscopic
dataset, where it outperforms existing methods in anatomical depth
preservation.

Title: Logit Mixture Outlier Exposure for Fine-grained Out-of-Distribution
  Detection
Authors: Akito Shinohara, Kohei Fukuda, Hiroaki Aizawa
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to DICTA2025
\\
  The ability to detect out-of-distribution data is essential not only for
ensuring robustness against unknown or unexpected input data but also for
improving the generalization performance of the model. Among various
out-of-distribution detection methods, Outlier Exposure and Mixture Outlier
Exposure are promising approaches that enhance out-of-distribution detection
performance by exposing the outlier data during training. However, even with
these sophisticated techniques, it remains challenging for models to learn the
relationships between classes effectively and to distinguish data sampling from
in-distribution and out-of-distribution clearly. Therefore, we focus on the
logit space, where the properties between class-wise distributions are
distinctly separated from those in the input or feature spaces. Specifically,
we propose a linear interpolation technique in the logit space that mixes
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to facilitate smoothing logits
between classes and improve the out-of-distribution detection performance,
particularly for out-of-distribution data that lie close to the in-distribution
data. Additionally, we enforce consistency between the logits obtained through
mixing in the logit space and those generated via mixing in the input space.
Our experiments demonstrate that our logit-space mixing technique reduces the
abrupt fluctuations in the model outputs near the decision boundaries,
resulting in smoother and more reliable separation between in-distribution and
out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a fine-grained out-of-distribution detection task.

  Applications (ICMLA'25)
\\
  3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations
of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships.
While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing
methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from
semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to
complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world,
incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model
for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal
information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing
process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and
local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene
reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that
GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g.,
CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for
complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented
architecture will be made available at

  Facial emotion recognition (FER) models trained only on pixels often fail to
generalize across datasets because facial appearance is an indirect and biased
proxy for underlying affect. We present NeuroGaze-Distill, a cross-modal
distillation framework that transfers brain-informed priors into an image-only
FER student via static Valence/Arousal (V/A) prototypes and a
depression-inspired geometric prior (D-Geo). A teacher trained on EEG
topographic maps from DREAMER (with MAHNOB-HCI as unlabeled support) produces a
consolidated 5x5 V/A prototype grid that is frozen and reused; no EEG-face
pairing and no non-visual signals at deployment are required. The student
(ResNet-18/50) is trained on FERPlus with conventional CE/KD and two
lightweight regularizers: (i) Proto-KD (cosine) aligns student features to the
static prototypes; (ii) D-Geo softly shapes the embedding geometry in line with
affective findings often reported in depression research (e.g., anhedonia-like
contraction in high-valence regions). We evaluate both within-domain (FERPlus
validation) and cross-dataset protocols (AffectNet-mini; optional CK+),
reporting standard 8-way scores alongside present-only Macro-F1 and balanced
accuracy to fairly handle label-set mismatch. Ablations attribute consistent
gains to prototypes and D-Geo, and favor 5x5 over denser grids for stability.
The method is simple, deployable, and improves robustness without architectural
complexity.

  Multimodal learning has attracted much attention in recent years due to its
ability to effectively utilize data features from a variety of different
modalities. Diagnosing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques directly
from carotid 3D MRI images is relatively challenging for both radiologists and
conventional 3D vision networks. In clinical practice, radiologists assess
patient conditions using a multimodal approach that incorporates various
imaging modalities and domain-specific expertise, paving the way for the
creation of multimodal diagnostic networks. In this paper, we have developed an
effective strategy to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge to automate the
diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability through Variation inference and
Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD). This method excels in harnessing
cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology
reports within training data, thereby enhancing the diagnostic network's
accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images. We conducted in-depth experiments on
the dataset collected in-house and verified the effectiveness of the VMD
strategy we proposed.

  Interpolation with Guaranteed Initialization
Authors: Xue Zhang, Bingshuo Hu, Gene Cheung
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Conventional deep neural nets (DNNs) initialize network parameters at random
and then optimize each one via stochastic gradient descent (SGD), resulting in
substantial risk of poor-performing local minima.Focusing on the image
interpolation problem and leveraging a recent theorem that maps a
(pseudo-)linear interpolator {\Theta} to a directed graph filter that is a
solution to a MAP problem regularized with a graph shift variation (GSV) prior,
we first initialize a directed graph adjacency matrix A based on a known
interpolator {\Theta}, establishing a baseline performance.Then, towards
further gain, we learn perturbation matrices P and P(2) from data to augment A,
whose restoration effects are implemented via Douglas-Rachford (DR) iterations,
which we unroll into a lightweight interpretable neural net.Experimental
results demonstrate state-of-the-art image interpolation results, while
drastically reducing network parameters.

  The recent success of immersive applications is pushing the research
community to define new approaches to process 360{\deg} images and videos and
optimize their transmission. Among these, saliency estimation provides a
powerful tool that can be used to identify visually relevant areas and,
consequently, adapt processing algorithms. Although saliency estimation has
been widely investigated for 2D content, very few algorithms have been proposed
for 360{\deg} saliency estimation. Towards this goal, we introduce Sphere-GAN,
a saliency detection model for 360{\deg} videos that leverages a Generative
Adversarial Network with spherical convolutions. Extensive experiments were
conducted using a public 360{\deg} video saliency dataset, and the results
demonstrate that Sphere-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in accurately
predicting saliency maps.

  Accurate land cover classification from satellite imagery is crucial in
environmental monitoring and sustainable resource management. However, it
remains challenging due to the complexity of natural landscapes, the visual
similarity between classes, and the significant class imbalance in the
available datasets. To address these issues, we propose a dual encoder
architecture that independently extracts modality-specific features from
optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, which are then fused using
a cross-modality attention-fusion module named Cross-modality Land cover
segmentation with Attention and Imbalance- aware Reasoning-Enhanced
Explanations (CLAIRE). This fusion mechanism highlights complementary spatial
and textural features, enabling the network to better capture detailed and
diverse land cover patterns. We incorporate a hybrid loss function that
utilizes Weighted Focal Loss and Tversky Loss named RIFT (Rare-Instance
Focal-Tversky) to address class imbalance and improve segmentation performance
across underrepresented categories. Our model achieves competitive performance
across multiple benchmarks: a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 56.02% and
Overall Accuracy (OA) of 84.56% on the WHU-OPT-SAR dataset; strong
generalization with a mIoU of 59.89% and OA of 73.92% on the OpenEarthMap-SAR
dataset; and remarkable robustness under cloud-obstructed conditions, achieving
an mIoU of 86.86% and OA of 94.58% on the PIE-RGB-SAR dataset. Additionally, we
introduce a metric-driven reasoning module generated by a Small Language Model
(Phi-3), which generates expert-level, sample-specific justifications for model
predictions, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability.

  While generative world models have advanced video and occupancy-based data
synthesis, LiDAR generation remains underexplored despite its importance for
accurate 3D perception. Extending generation to 4D LiDAR data introduces
challenges in controllability, temporal stability, and evaluation. We present
LiDARCrafter, a unified framework that converts free-form language into
editable LiDAR sequences. Instructions are parsed into ego-centric scene
graphs, which a tri-branch diffusion model transforms into object layouts,
trajectories, and shapes. A range-image diffusion model generates the initial
scan, and an autoregressive module extends it into a temporally coherent
sequence. The explicit layout design further supports object-level editing,
such as insertion or relocation. To enable fair assessment, we provide
EvalSuite, a benchmark spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level metrics. On
nuScenes, LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency, offering a foundation for LiDAR-based simulation and data
augmentation.

Authors: Wenyan Li, Raphael Tang, Chengzu Li, Caiqi Zhang, Ivan Vuli\'c, Anders
  S{\o}gaard
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
\\
  Vision--language models (VLMs) often process visual inputs through a
pretrained vision encoder, followed by a projection into the language model's
embedding space via a connector component. While crucial for modality fusion,
the potential information loss induced by this projection step and its direct
impact on model capabilities remain understudied. We introduce two
complementary approaches to examine and quantify this loss by analyzing the
latent representation space. First, we evaluate semantic information
preservation by analyzing changes in k-nearest neighbor relationships between
image representations, before and after projection. Second, we directly measure
information loss by reconstructing visual embeddings from the projected
representation, localizing loss at an image patch level. Experiments reveal
that connectors substantially distort the local geometry of visual
representations, with k-nearest neighbors diverging by 40--60\%
post-projection, correlating with degradation in retrieval performance. The
patch-level embedding reconstruction provides interpretable insights for model
behavior on visually grounded question-answering tasks, finding that areas of
high information loss reliably predict instances where models struggle.

Authors: Zixuan Fu, Yan Ren, Finn Carter, Chenyue Wen, Le Ku, Daheng Yu, Emily
  Davis, Bo Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Camera ready version
\\
  Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but
pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing
demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW
content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while
preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE}
(Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust
concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an
\emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the
model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike
prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a
target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We
provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper
bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW
removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT,
MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy
while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating
adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven
fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in
diffusion models.

\\
  This work presents Robust Representation Learning via Adaptive Mask (RAM++),
a two-stage framework for all-in-one image restoration. RAM++ integrates
high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve
content-oriented robust restoration. It addresses the limitations of existing
degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios (e.g., degradations strongly
coupled with image structures). RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as
unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak
generalization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive
Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level
masks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the
network to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various
degradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning
strategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the
integrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while
retaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy
that leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant
representations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful
and semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves
robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen,
extreme, and mixed degradations. Our code and model will be released at

\\
  Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS), an emerging task
that adapts Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) to the remote sensing (RS)
domain, remains underexplored due to the absence of a unified evaluation
benchmark and the domain gap between natural and RS images. To bridge these
gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench})
based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation
across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several
representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly
applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose
\textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for
remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a
Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures
rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities
across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion)
transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a
lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing
Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and
facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines
by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through
efficient aggregation. Our code is

  While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated remarkable success in
image generation, extending them to layout-conditioned generation remains
challenging due to the sparse nature of layout conditions and the risk of
feature entanglement. We present Structured Masking for AR-based
Layout-to-Image (SMARLI), a novel framework for layoutto-image generation that
effectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image
generation. To equip AR model with layout control, a specially designed
structured masking strategy is applied to attention computation to govern the
interaction among the global prompt, layout, and image tokens. This design
prevents mis-association between different regions and their descriptions while
enabling sufficient injection of layout constraints into the generation
process. To further enhance generation quality and layout accuracy, we
incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based post-training
scheme with specially designed layout reward functions for next-set-based AR
models. Experimental results demonstrate that SMARLI is able to seamlessly
integrate layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising
generation quality. It achieves superior layoutaware control while maintaining
the structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models.

  Animal behavior analysis plays a crucial role in understanding animal
welfare, health status, and productivity in agricultural settings. However,
traditional manual observation methods are time-consuming, subjective, and
limited in scalability. We present a modular pipeline that leverages
open-sourced state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automate animal
behavior analysis in a group housing environment. Our approach combines
state-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking
and segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for
robust behavior recognition. The pipeline addresses challenges including animal
occlusions and group housing scenarios as demonstrated in indoor pig
monitoring. We validated our system on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset
for multiple behavioral tasks. Our temporal model achieved 94.2% overall
accuracy, representing a 21.2 percentage point improvement over existing
methods. The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3%
identity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular
design suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further
validation across species would be required. The open-source implementation
provides a scalable solution for behavior monitoring, contributing to precision
pig farming and welfare assessment through automated, objective, and continuous
analysis.

Title: AvatarSync: Rethinking Talking-Head Animation through Autoregressive
  Perspective
Authors: Yuchen Deng, Xiuyang Wu, Hai-Tao Zheng, Suiyang Zhang, Yi He, Yuxing
  Han
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Existing talking-head animation approaches based on Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or diffusion models often suffer from inter-frame flicker,
identity drift, and slow inference. These limitations inherent to their video
generation pipelines restrict their suitability for applications. To address
this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme
representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head
animations from a single reference image, driven directly text or audio input.
In addition, AvatarSync adopts a two-stage generation strategy, decoupling
semantic modeling from visual dynamics, which is a deliberate "Divide and
Conquer" design. The first stage, Facial Keyframe Generation (FKG), focuses on
phoneme-level semantic representation by leveraging the many-to-one mapping
from text or audio to phonemes. A Phoneme-to-Visual Mapping is constructed to
anchor abstract phonemes to character-level units. Combined with a customized
Text-Frame Causal Attention Mask, the keyframes are generated. The second
stage, inter-frame interpolation, emphasizes temporal coherence and visual
smoothness. We introduce a timestamp-aware adaptive strategy based on a
selective state space model, enabling efficient bidirectional context
reasoning. To support deployment, we optimize the inference pipeline to reduce
latency without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments show that
AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual
fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a
scalable and controllable solution.

\\
  Fetal motion is a critical indicator of neurological development and
intrauterine health, yet its quantification remains challenging, particularly
at earlier gestational ages (GA). Current methods track fetal motion by
predicting the location of annotated landmarks on 3D echo planar imaging (EPI)
time-series, primarily in third-trimester fetuses. The predicted landmarks
enable simplification of the fetal body for downstream analysis. While these
methods perform well within their training age distribution, they consistently
fail to generalize to early GAs due to significant anatomical changes in both
mother and fetus across gestation, as well as the difficulty of obtaining
annotated early GA EPI data. In this work, we develop a cross-population data
augmentation framework that enables pose estimation models to robustly
generalize to younger GA clinical cohorts using only annotated images from
older GA cohorts. Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation
strategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal
positioning of early GAs. Our experiments find that cross-population
augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across
both older GA and challenging early GA cases. By enabling more reliable pose
estimation across gestation, our work potentially facilitates early clinical
detection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings. Code is

Title: End-to-End Learning of Multi-Organ Implicit Surfaces from 3D Medical
  Imaging Data
Authors: Farahdiba Zarin, Nicolas Padoy, J\'er\'emy Dana, and Vinkle Srivastav
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The fine-grained surface reconstruction of different organs from 3D medical
imaging can provide advanced diagnostic support and improved surgical planning.
However, the representation of the organs is often limited by the resolution,
with a detailed higher resolution requiring more memory and computing
footprint. Implicit representations of objects have been proposed to alleviate
this problem in general computer vision by providing compact and differentiable
functions to represent the 3D object shapes. However, architectural and
data-related differences prevent the direct application of these methods to
medical images. This work introduces ImplMORe, an end-to-end deep learning
method using implicit surface representations for multi-organ reconstruction
from 3D medical images. ImplMORe incorporates local features using a 3D CNN
encoder and performs multi-scale interpolation to learn the features in the
continuous domain using occupancy functions. We apply our method for single and
multiple organ reconstructions using the totalsegmentator dataset. By
leveraging the continuous nature of occupancy functions, our approach
outperforms the discrete explicit representation based surface reconstruction
approaches, providing fine-grained surface details of the organ at a resolution
higher than the given input image. The source code will be made publicly

Title: U-Mamba2: Scaling State Space Models for Dental Anatomy Segmentation in
  CBCT
Authors: Zhi Qin Tan, Xiatian Zhu, Owen Addison, Yunpeng Li
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a widely used 3D imaging technique in
dentistry, providing volumetric information about the anatomical structures of
jaws and teeth. Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for
clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains
time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new
neural network architecture designed for multi-anatomy CBCT segmentation in the
context of the ToothFairy3 challenge. U-Mamba2 integrates the Mamba2 state
space models into the U-Net architecture, enforcing stronger structural
constraints for higher efficiency without compromising performance. In
addition, we integrate interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks,
pre-train U-Mamba2 using self-supervised learning, and incorporate dental
domain knowledge into the model design to address key challenges of dental
anatomy segmentation in CBCT. Extensive experiments, including independent
tests, demonstrate that U-Mamba2 is both effective and efficient, securing top
3 places in both tasks of the Toothfairy3 challenge. In Task 1, U-Mamba2
achieved a mean Dice of 0.792, HD95 of 93.19 with the held-out test data, with
an average inference time of XX (TBC during the ODIN workshop). In Task 2,
U-Mamba2 achieved the mean Dice of 0.852 and HD95 of 7.39 with the held-out
test data. The code is publicly available at

Title: Progressive Flow-inspired Unfolding for Spectral Compressive Imaging
Authors: Xiaodong Wang, Ping Wang, Zijun He, Mengjie Qin, Xin Yuan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) retrieves a 3D hyperspectral
image (HSI) from a single 2D compressed measurement, which is a highly
challenging reconstruction task. Recent deep unfolding networks (DUNs),
empowered by explicit data-fidelity updates and implicit deep denoisers, have
achieved the state of the art in CASSI reconstruction. However, existing
unfolding approaches suffer from uncontrollable reconstruction trajectories,
leading to abrupt quality jumps and non-gradual refinement across stages.
Inspired by diffusion trajectories and flow matching, we propose a novel
trajectory-controllable unfolding framework that enforces smooth, continuous
optimization paths from noisy initial estimates to high-quality
reconstructions. To achieve computational efficiency, we design an efficient
spatial-spectral Transformer tailored for hyperspectral reconstruction, along
with a frequency-domain fusion module to gurantee feature consistency.
Experiments on simulation and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
better reconstruction quality and efficiency than prior state-of-the-art
approaches.

  MRI
Authors: Yihong Chen, Jiancheng Yang, Deniz Sayin Mercadier, Hieu Le, Juerg

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Reconstructing cardiac motion from cine CMR sequences is critical for
diagnosis, prediction, and intervention. Existing methods rely on complete CMR
stacks to infer full heart motion, limiting their utility in intra-procedural
scenarios where only sparse observations are available. We present TetHeart,
the first end-to-end framework that unifies full 4D multi-structure heart mesh
recovery from both offline full-stack acquisitions and intra-procedural
sparse-slice observations. Our method leverages deep deformable tetrahedra, an
explicit-implicit hybrid representation, to capture shape and motion in a
coherent space shared across cardiac structures. It is initialized from
high-quality pre-procedural or offline-acquired full stacks to build detailed,
patient-specific heart meshes, which can then be updated using whatever slices
are available, from full stacks down to a single slice. We further incorporate
several key innovations: (i) an attentive mechanism for slice-adaptive 2D-3D
feature assembly that dynamically integrates information from arbitrary numbers
of slices at any position, combined with a distillation strategy from
full-slice to sparse-slice settings to ensure accurate reconstruction under
extreme sparsity; and (ii) a two-stage weakly supervised motion learning scheme
requiring only keyframe (e.g., ED and ES) annotations. Trained and validated on
three large public datasets and externally evaluated zero-shot on additional
private interventional and public CMR datasets, TetHeart achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization in both pre- and
intra-procedural settings.

Title: FS-SAM2: Adapting Segment Anything Model 2 for Few-Shot Semantic
  Segmentation via Low-Rank Adaptation
Authors: Bernardo Forni, Gabriele Lombardi, Federico Pozzi, Mirco Planamente
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at ICIAP 2025
\\
  Few-shot semantic segmentation has recently attracted great attention. The
goal is to develop a model capable of segmenting unseen classes using only a
few annotated samples. Most existing approaches adapt a pre-trained model by
training from scratch an additional module. Achieving optimal performance with
these approaches requires extensive training on large-scale datasets. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a foundational model for zero-shot image and
video segmentation with a modular design. In this paper, we propose a Few-Shot
segmentation method based on SAM2 (FS-SAM2), where SAM2's video capabilities
are directly repurposed for the few-shot task. Moreover, we apply a Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the original modules in order to handle the diverse images
typically found in standard datasets, unlike the temporally connected frames
used in SAM2's pre-training. With this approach, only a small number of
parameters is meta-trained, which effectively adapts SAM2 while benefiting from
its impressive segmentation performance. Our method supports any K-shot
configuration. We evaluate FS-SAM2 on the PASCAL-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$ and
FSS-1000 datasets, achieving remarkable results and demonstrating excellent
computational efficiency during inference. Code is available at

  Tram-human interaction safety is an important challenge, given that trams
frequently operate in densely populated areas, where collisions can range from
minor injuries to fatal outcomes. This paper addresses the issue from the
perspective of designing a solution leveraging digital image processing, deep
learning, and artificial intelligence to improve the safety of pedestrians,
drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers. We present RailSafeNet, a
real-time framework that fuses semantic segmentation, object detection and a
rule-based Distance Assessor to highlight track intrusions. Using only
monocular video, the system identifies rails, localises nearby objects and
classifies their risk by comparing projected distances with the standard 1435mm
rail gauge. Experiments on the diverse RailSem19 dataset show that a
class-filtered SegFormer B3 model achieves 65% intersection-over-union (IoU),
while a fine-tuned YOLOv8 attains 75.6% mean average precision (mAP) calculated
at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. RailSafeNet therefore
delivers accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can warn drivers
before dangerous situations escalate. Code available at

Title: Look Again, Think Slowly: Enhancing Visual Reflection in Vision-Language
  Models
Authors: Pu Jian, Junhong Wu, Wei Sun, Chen Wang, Shuo Ren, Jiajun Zhang
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP2025 Main
\\
  Recent advances in text-only "slow-thinking" reasoning have prompted efforts
to transfer this capability to vision-language models (VLMs), for training
visual reasoning models (\textbf{VRMs}). owever, such transfer faces critical
challenges: Effective "slow thinking" in VRMs requires \textbf{visual
reflection}, the ability to check the reasoning process based on visual
information. Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs
exhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information
diminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge,
we propose a new VRM \textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection
based on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for
reinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning
data by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs,
enabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual
attention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based
on visual information. Therefore, \textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates
significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.
Furthermore, \textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent
reliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective
enhancement in visual reflection capabilities.

  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition that
negatively impacts both individual well-being and global public health.
Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)
and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving
diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods
employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations
built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex
brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and
Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for
defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and
functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are
trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches.
Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional
relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were
conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained
78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and
78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the
cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific
anatomical priors for MDD detection.

  We introduce Hierarchical Streaming Video Understanding, a task that combines
online temporal action localization with free-form description generation.
Given the scarcity of datasets with hierarchical and fine-grained temporal
annotations, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively group atomic actions into
higher-level events, enriching existing datasets. We then propose OpenHOUSE
(Open-ended Hierarchical Online Understanding System for Events), which extends
streaming action perception beyond action classification. OpenHOUSE features a
specialized streaming module that accurately detects boundaries between closely
adjacent actions, nearly doubling the performance of direct extensions of
existing methods. We envision the future of streaming action perception in the
integration of powerful generative models, with OpenHOUSE representing a key
step in that direction.

this approach, we compare LoRA with traditional full fine-tuning and
inference-only (no fine-tuning) methods. Cropped images of two sizes (50 mm3
and 75 mm3), centered at the treatment isocenter, in addition to different
adaptation techniques for adapting the 2D LVMs for 3D data were used to
determine the sensitivity of the models to spatial context. Experimental
results show that LoRA achieves comparable or superior performance to
traditional fine-tuning while significantly reducing computational costs and

Title: HoloGarment: 360{\deg} Novel View Synthesis of In-the-Wild Garments
Authors: Johanna Karras, Yingwei Li, Yasamin Jafarian, Ira
  Kemelmacher-Shlizerman
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.GR cs.LG
\\
  Novel view synthesis (NVS) of in-the-wild garments is a challenging task due
significant occlusions, complex human poses, and cloth deformations. Prior
methods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and
static objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this
paper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3
images or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates
360{\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to
bridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit
training paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and
small-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.
During inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic
video-to-360{\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment "atlas"
representation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world
video. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all
viewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that
HoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild
garments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles
challenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and
occlusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture
details, and accurate geometry. Visit our project page for additional results:

and human mesh recovery from in-the-wild LiDAR point clouds. We compare
existing approaches across several key dimensions, and propose a structured
taxonomy to classify these methods. Following this taxonomy, we analyze each
method's strengths, limitations, and design choices. In addition, (i) we
perform a quantitative comparison of the three most widely used datasets,
detailing their characteristics; (ii) we compile unified definitions of all
evaluation metrics; and (iii) we establish benchmark tables for both tasks on
these datasets to enable fair comparisons and promote progress in the field. We
also outline open challenges and research directions critical for advancing
LiDAR-based 3D human understanding. Moreover, we maintain an accompanying
webpage that organizes papers according to our taxonomy and continuously update
it with new studies:

  The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry
and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years,
driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning.
However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally
constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and
benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and
spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric
reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To
address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain,
multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld
consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public
datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets,
OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more
realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a
challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning
existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains
across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating
OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision
OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D
world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the
physical world.

Title: LazyDrag: Enabling Stable Drag-Based Editing on Multi-Modal Diffusion
  Transformers via Explicit Correspondence
Authors: Zixin Yin, Xili Dai, Duomin Wang, Xianfang Zeng, Lionel M. Ni, Gang
  Yu, Heung-Yeung Shum
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The reliance on implicit point matching via attention has become a core
bottleneck in drag-based editing, resulting in a fundamental compromise on
weakened inversion strength and costly test-time optimization (TTO). This
compromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models,
suppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper,
we introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for
Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on
implicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit
correspondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the
attention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable
full-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing
task. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability
of models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with
text guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach:
opening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects
like a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes
like moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round
workflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the
DragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual
quality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only
establishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to
editing paradigms.

Title: Character-Centric Understanding of Animated Movies
Authors: Zhongrui Gui, Junyu Xie, Tengda Han, Weidi Xie, Andrew Zisserman
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Animated movies are captivating for their unique character designs and
imaginative storytelling, yet they pose significant challenges for existing
recognition systems. Unlike the consistent visual patterns detected by
conventional face recognition methods, animated characters exhibit extreme
diversity in their appearance, motion, and deformation. In this work, we
propose an audio-visual pipeline to enable automatic and robust animated
character recognition, and thereby enhance character-centric understanding of
animated movies. Central to our approach is the automatic construction of an
audio-visual character bank from online sources. This bank contains both visual
exemplars and voice (audio) samples for each character, enabling subsequent
multi-modal character recognition despite long-tailed appearance distributions.
Building on accurate character recognition, we explore two downstream
applications: Audio Description (AD) generation for visually impaired
audiences, and character-aware subtitling for the hearing impaired. To support
research in this domain, we introduce CMD-AM, a new dataset of 75 animated
movies with comprehensive annotations. Our character-centric pipeline
demonstrates significant improvements in both accessibility and narrative
comprehension for animated content over prior face-detection-based approaches.

Title: Asynchronous Gathering of Opaque Robots with Mobility Faults

Categories: cs.DC cs.MA cs.RO
Comments: 38 pages, 26 figures, and 1 table
\\
  We consider the fundamental benchmarking problem of gathering in an
$(N,f)$-fault system consisting of $N$ robots, of which at most $f$ might fail
at any execution, under asynchrony. Two seminal results established
impossibility of a solution in the oblivious robot (OBLOT) model in a
$(2,0)$-fault system under semi-synchrony and in a $(3,1)$-Byzantine fault
system under asynchrony. Recently, a breakthrough result circumvented the first
impossibility result by giving a deterministic algorithm in a $(2,0)$-fault
system under asynchrony in the luminous robot (LUMI) model using 2-colored
lights. However, a breakthrough result established impossibility of gathering
in a $(2,1)$-crash system in the LUMI model under semi-synchrony. In this
paper, we consider a {\em mobility fault} model in which a robot crash only
impacts it mobility but not the operation of the light.
  We establish four results under asynchrony in LUMI with the mobility fault
model. We show that it is impossible to solve gathering in a $(2,1)$-mobility
fault system using 2-colored lights, and then give a solution using 3-colored
lights, which is optimal w.r.t. the number of colors. We then consider an
$(N,f)$-mobility fault system, $f<N$, both $N,f$ not known, and give two
deterministic algorithms that exhibit a nice time-color trade-off: The first
with time $O(N)$ using 7-colored lights and the second with time
$O(\max\{\ell,f\})$ using 26-colored lights, where $\ell< N$ is the number of
distinct convex layers of robot positions in the initial configuration.
Interestingly, for $l, f = O(1)$, our result is optimal. Our algorithms for an
$(N,f)$-mobility fault system are the first to be analysed time complexity, can
withstand obstructed visibility (opaque robot model) and asynchronous
scheduling.

Title: MinatoLoader: Accelerating Machine Learning Training Through Efficient
  Data Preprocessing
Authors: Rahma Nouaji, Stella Bitchebe, Ricardo Macedo, Oana Balmau
Categories: cs.DC cs.LG
Comments: Paper accepted at EuroSys 2026 (will be updated after the
  camera-ready)
\\
  Data loaders are used by Machine Learning (ML) frameworks like PyTorch and
TensorFlow to apply transformations to data before feeding it into the
accelerator. This operation is called data preprocessing. Data preprocessing
plays an important role in the ML training workflow because if it is
inefficiently pipelined with the training, it can yield high GPU idleness,
resulting in important training delays. Unfortunately, existing data loaders
turn out to waste GPU resources, with $76\%$ GPU idleness when using the
PyTorch data loader, for example. One key source of inefficiency is the
variability in preprocessing time across samples within the same dataset.
Existing data loaders are oblivious to this variability, and they construct
batches without any consideration of slow or fast samples. In this case, the
entire batch is delayed by a single slow sample, stalling the training pipeline
and resulting in head-of-line blocking.
  To address these inefficiencies, we present MinatoLoader, a general-purpose
data loader for PyTorch that accelerates training and improves GPU utilization.
MinatoLoader is designed for a single-server setup, containing multiple GPUs.
It continuously prepares data in the background and actively constructs batches
by prioritizing fast-to-preprocess samples, while slower samples are processed
in parallel.
  We evaluate MinatoLoader on servers with V100 and A100 GPUs. On a machine
with four A100 GPUs, MinatoLoader improves the training time of a wide range of
workloads by up to $7.5\times$ ($3.6\times$ on average) over PyTorch DataLoader
and Pecan, and up to $3\times$ ($2.2\times$ on average) over DALI. It also
increases average GPU utilization from 46.4\% with PyTorch to 90.45\%, while
preserving model accuracy and enabling faster convergence.

  Hardware prefetching is critical to fill the performance gap between CPU
speeds and slower memory accesses. With multicore architectures becoming
commonplace, traditional prefetchers are severely challenged. Independent core
operation creates significant redundancy (up to 20% of prefetch requests are
duplicates), causing unnecessary memory bus traffic and wasted bandwidth.
Furthermore, cutting-edge prefetchers such as Pythia suffer from about a 10%
performance loss when scaling from a single-core to a four-core system. To
solve these problems, we propose CRL-Pythia, a coordinated reinforcement
learning based prefetcher specifically designed for multicore systems. In this
work, CRL-Pythia addresses these issues by enabling cross-core sharing of
information and cooperative prefetching decisions, which greatly reduces
redundant prefetch requests and improves learning convergence across cores. Our
experiments demonstrate that CRL-Pythia outperforms single Pythia
configurations in all cases, with approximately 12% IPC (instructions per
cycle) improvement for bandwidth-constrained workloads, while imposing moderate
hardware overhead. Our sensitivity analyses also verify its robustness and
scalability, thereby making CRL-Pythia a practical and efficient solution to
contemporary multicore systems.

Title: Enhancing Type Safety in MPI with Rust: A Statically Verified Approach
  for RSMPI
Authors: Nafees Iqbal, Jed Brown
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a fundamental tool for building
high-performance computing (HPC) applications, enabling efficient communication
across distributed systems. Despite its widespread adoption, MPI's low-level
interface and lack of built-in type safety make it prone to runtime errors,
undefined behavior, and debugging challenges, especially in large-scale
applications. Rust, a modern systems programming language, offers a compelling
solution with its strong type system, which enforces memory and type safety at
compile time without compromising performance. This paper introduces a
type-safe communication framework for MPI, built on the RSMPI library, to
address the limitations of traditional MPI programming. At its core is the
TypedCommunicator, an abstraction that enforces static type safety in
point-to-point communication operations. By leveraging Rust's Equivalence
trait, our framework guarantees that only compatible types can participate in
communication, catching mismatches either at compile time or through runtime
validation. The framework supports both single-value and slice-based
communication, providing an intuitive API for diverse data structures. Our
implementation demonstrates that this approach eliminates common MPI errors,
improves developer productivity, and maintains performance, adhering to Rust's
principle of zero-cost abstractions. This work lays the foundation for
extending type safety to collective operations, advancing the robustness of
parallel computing in Rust.

  The increasing size of large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge in
memory requirements during training, often exceeding the capacity of
high-bandwidth memory (HBM). Swap-based memory optimization incurs neither
accuracy loss nor additional end-to-end overhead when effectively overlapped,
thus being an attractive solution. However, existing swap methods assume
consistent operator sequences, which is impractical in Eager Mode, where
operator sequences can vary during change.
  We propose Chameleon, which redesigns the end-to-end process of swap-based
memory optimization and is the first work to consider varying operator
sequences in Eager Mode. Chameleon (i) introduces a lightweight online profiler
to enable continuous profiling for monitoring operator sequences, (ii)
generates effective swap policies with limited operator information, and (iii)
optimizes the policy execution module for accurate policy application and
better performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Chameleon reduces
profiling overhead by 84.25%, enables training models up to 4x larger than
hardware memory while adapting to changes in operator sequences, improves
performance by up to 38.94% compared to recomputation or high-degree
parallelism.

\\
  The surge in large language models (LLMs) has fundamentally reshaped the
landscape of GPU usage patterns, creating an urgent need for more efficient
management strategies. While cloud providers employ spot instances to reduce
costs for low-priority (LP) tasks, existing schedulers still grapple with high
eviction rates and lengthy queuing times. To address these limitations, we
present GFS, a novel preemptive scheduling framework that enhances
service-level objective (SLO) compliance for high-priority (HP) tasks while
minimizing preemptions to LP tasks. Firstly, GFS utilizes a lightweight
forecasting model that predicts GPU demand among different tenants, enabling
proactive resource management. Secondly, GFS employs a dynamic allocation
mechanism to adjust the spot quota for LP tasks with guaranteed durations.
Lastly, GFS incorporates a preemptive scheduling policy that prioritizes HP
tasks while minimizing the impact on LP tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of GFS through both real-world implementation and simulations. The results show
that GFS reduces eviction rates by 33.0\%, and cuts queuing delays by 44.1\%
for LP tasks. Furthermore, GFS enhances the GPU allocation rate by up to 22.8\%
in real production clusters. In a production cluster of more than 10,000 GPUs,
GFS yields roughly \$459,715 in monthly benefits.

Title: Linear Complexity $\mathcal{H}^2$ Direct Solver for Fine-Grained
  Parallel Architectures
Authors: Wajih Boukaram, David Keyes, Sherry Li, Yang Liu, George Turkiyyah
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  We present factorization and solution phases for a new linear complexity
direct solver designed for concurrent batch operations on fine-grained parallel
architectures, for matrices amenable to hierarchical representation. We focus
on the strong-admissibility-based $\mathcal{H}^2$ format, where strong
recursive skeletonization factorization compresses remote interactions. We
build upon previous implementations of $\mathcal{H}^2$ matrix construction for
efficient factorization and solution algorithm design, which are illustrated
graphically in stepwise detail. The algorithms are ``blackbox'' in the sense
that the only inputs are the matrix and right-hand side, without analytical or
geometrical information about the origin of the system. We demonstrate linear
complexity scaling in both time and memory on four representative families of
dense matrices up to one million in size. Parallel scaling up to 16 threads is
enabled by a multi-level matrix graph coloring and avoidance of dynamic memory
allocations thanks to prefix-sum memory management. An experimental backward
error analysis is included. We break down the timings of different phases,
identify phases that are memory-bandwidth limited, and discuss alternatives for
phases that may be sensitive to the trend to employ lower precisions for
performance.

Title: Adaptive K-PackCache: Cost-Centric Data Caching in Cloud
Authors: Suvarthi Sarkar, Aadarshraj Sah, Poddutoori Sweeya Reddy, Aryabartta
  Sahu
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Recent advances in data analytics have enabled the accurate prediction of
user access patterns, giving rise to the idea of packed caching delivering
multiple co accessed data items together as a bundle. This improves caching
efficiency, as accessing one item often implies the need for others. Prior work
has explored only 2 item pairwise packing. In this paper, we extend the concept
to general K packing, allowing variable size bundles for improved flexibility
and performance. We formulate the K PackCache problem from a content delivery
network CDN operator perspective, aiming to minimize total cost comprising two
components: transfer cost modeled as a base cost plus a linearly increasing
term with the number of items packed, and memory rental cost for caching, which
depends on how long and how much is stored. Overpacking increases cost due to
low utility, underpacking leads to missed sharing opportunities. We propose an
online algorithm, Adaptive K PackCache AKPC, which dynamically forms, merges,
and splits data cliques based on user access patterns and content correlation.
Our approach supports batch requests, enables approximate clique merging, and
offers a formal competitive guarantee. Through extensive evaluation on the
Netflix and Spotify datasets, AKPC reduces total cost by up to 63 and 55
percentage over online baselines, respectively, and achieves performance within
15 and 13 percentage of the optimal. This demonstrates its scalability and
effectiveness for real world caching systems.

  This paper addresses the deadline-constrained task offloading and resource
allocation problem in multi-access edge computing. We aim to determine where
each task is offloaded and processed, as well as corresponding communication
and computation resource allocations, to maximize the total saved energy for
IoT devices, while considering task deadline and system resource constraints.
Especially, our system allows each task to be offloaded to one of its
accessible access points (APs) and processed on a server that is not co-located
with its offloading AP. We formulate this problem as an Integer Nonlinear
Programming problem and show it is NP-Hard. To address this problem, we propose
a Graph-Matching-based Approximation Algorithm ($\mathtt{GMA}$), the first
approximation algorithm of its kind. $\mathtt{GMA}$ leverages linear
relaxation, tripartite graph construction, and a Linear Programming rounding
technique. We prove that $\mathtt{GMA}$ is a
$\frac{1-\alpha}{2+\epsilon}$-approximation algorithm, where $\epsilon$ is a
small positive value, and $\alpha$ ($0$$\le$$\alpha$$<$$1$) is a system
parameter that ensures the resource allocated to any task by an AP or a server
cannot exceed $\alpha$ times its resource capacity. Experiments show that, in
practice, $\mathtt{GMA}$'s energy saving achieves $97\%$ of the optimal value
on average.

generalizes the classical flow shop processor configuration by replacing each

Similarly, the multiprocessor tasks generalize the classical assumption, by
allowing a task to require more than one processor simultaneously for its
processing. In this work we present the algorithm for solving the problem based
on the tabu search technique. The proposed algorithm uses parallel and
distributed mechanisms for neighborhood evaluation and well balances
heterogeneous network environment.

  The collaborative efforts of large communities in science experiments, often
comprising thousands of global members, reflect a monumental commitment to
exploration and discovery. Recently, advanced and complex data processing has
gained increasing importance in science experiments. Data processing workflows
typically consist of multiple intricate steps, and the precise specification of
resource requirements is crucial for each step to allocate optimal resources
for effective processing. Estimating resource requirements in advance is
challenging due to a wide range of analysis scenarios, varying skill levels
among community members, and the continuously increasing spectrum of computing
options. One practical approach to mitigate these challenges involves initially
processing a subset of each step to measure precise resource utilization from
actual processing profiles before completing the entire step. While this
two-staged approach enables processing on optimal resources for most of the
workflow, it has drawbacks such as initial inaccuracies leading to potential
failures and suboptimal resource usage, along with overhead from waiting for
initial processing completion, which is critical for fast-turnaround analyses.
In this context, our study introduces a novel pipeline of machine learning
models within a comprehensive workflow management system, the Production and
Distributed Analysis (PanDA) system. These models employ advanced machine
learning techniques to predict key resource requirements, overcoming challenges
posed by limited upfront knowledge of characteristics at each step. Accurate
forecasts of resource requirements enable informed and proactive
decision-making in workflow management, enhancing the efficiency of handling
diverse, complex workflows across heterogeneous resources.

Title: Towards the Distributed Large-scale k-NN Graph Construction by Graph
  Merge
Authors: Cheng Zhang and Wan-Lei Zhao and Shihai Xiao and Jiajie Yao and
  Xuecang Zhang
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 14 pages, 14 figures
\\
  In order to support the real-time interaction with LLMs and the instant
search or the instant recommendation on social media, it becomes an imminent
problem to build k-NN graph or indexing graph for the massive number of
vectorized multimedia data. In such scenarios, the scale of the data or the
scale of the graph may exceed the processing capacity of a single machine. This
paper aims to address the graph construction problem of such scale via
efficient graph merge. For the graph construction on a single node, two generic
and highly parallelizable algorithms, namely Two-way Merge and Multi-way Merge
are proposed to merge subgraphs into one. For the graph construction across
multiple nodes, a multi-node procedure based on Two-way Merge is presented. The
procedure makes it feasible to construct a large-scale k-NN graph/indexing
graph on either a single node or multiple nodes when the data size exceeds the
memory capacity of one node. Extensive experiments are conducted on both
large-scale k-NN graph and indexing graph construction. For the k-NN graph
construction, the large-scale and high-quality k-NN graphs are constructed by
graph merge in parallel. Typically, a billion-scale k-NN graph can be built in
approximately 17h when only three nodes are employed. For the indexing graph
construction, similar NN search performance as the original indexing graph is
achieved with the merged indexing graphs while requiring much less time of
construction.

Title: A Uniqueness Theorem for Distributed Computation under Physical
  Constraint
Authors: Zhiyuan Ren, Mingxuan Lu, Wenchi Cheng
Categories: cs.DC cs.NI
\\
  Foundational models of computation often abstract away physical hardware
limitations. However, in extreme environments like In-Network Computing (INC),
these limitations become inviolable laws, creating an acute trilemma among
communication efficiency, bounded memory, and robust scalability. Prevailing
distributed paradigms, while powerful in their intended domains, were not
designed for this stringent regime and thus face fundamental challenges. This
paper demonstrates that resolving this trilemma requires a shift in perspective
- from seeking engineering trade-offs to deriving solutions from logical
necessity. We establish a rigorous axiomatic system that formalizes these
physical constraints and prove that for the broad class of computations
admitting an idempotent merge operator, there exists a unique, optimal
paradigm. Any system satisfying these axioms must converge to a single normal
form: Self-Describing Parallel Flows (SDPF), a purely data-centric model where
stateless executors process flows that carry their own control logic. We
further prove this unique paradigm is convergent, Turing-complete, and minimal.
In the same way that the CAP theorem established a boundary for what is
impossible in distributed state management, our work provides a constructive
dual: a uniqueness theorem that reveals what is \textit{inevitable} for
distributed computation flows under physical law.

Title: LASLiN: A Learning-Augmented Peer-to-Peer Network
Authors: Julien Dallot, Caio Caldeira, Arash Pourdamghani, Olga Goussevskaia,
  Stefan Schmid
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  We introduce a learning-augmented peer-to-peer (P2P) network design that
leverages the predictions of traffic patterns to optimize the network's
topology. While keeping formal guarantees on the standard P2P metrics (routing
path length, maximum degree), we optimize the network in a demand-aware manner
and minimize the path lengths weighted by the peer-to-peer communication
demands. Our protocol is learning-augmented, meaning that each node receives an
individual, possibly inaccurate prediction about the future traffic patterns,
with the goal of improving the network's performances. We strike a trade-off
between significantly improved performances when the predictions are correct
(consistency) and polylogarithmic performances when the predictions are
arbitrary (robustness).
  We have two main contributions. First, we consider the centralized setting
and show that the problem of constructing an optimum static skip list network
(SLN) is solvable in polynomial time and can be computed via dynamic
programming. This problem is the natural demand-aware extension of the optimal
skip list problem.
  Second, we introduce the Uniform P2P protocol which generalizes skip list
networks (SLN) by relaxing the node's heights from discrete to continuous. We
show that Uniform achieves state-of-the-art performances: logarithmic routing
and maximum degree, both with high probability. We then use Uniform to build a
learning-augmented P2P protocol in order to incorporate demand-awareness,
leading to our main contribution, LASLiN. We prove that the performances of
LASLiN are consistent with those of an optimum static SLN with correct
predictions (given via our dynamic programming approach), and are at most a
logarithmic factor off the state-of-the-art P2P protocols if the predictions
are arbitrary wrong. For the special case of highly sparse demands, we show
that LASLiN achieves improved performances.

  Translating programs between various parallel programming languages is an
important problem in the high-performance computing (HPC) community. Existing
tools for this problem are either too narrow in scope and/or outdated. Recent
explosive growth in the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and their
ability to generate and translate code offers a potential alternative approach.
Toward that end, we first need to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs
to translate between parallel languages.
  In this work, we introduce UniPar, a systematic evaluation framework for
LLM-based parallel code translation. Specifically, in this work, we target
translations between serial code, CUDA, and OpenMP. Our goal is to assess how
well current instruction-tuned LLMs -- specifically GPT-4o-mini and
LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct -- can be used out of the box or enhanced through known
strategies. We evaluated four major usage modes: hyperparameter optimization
for decoding, zero- and few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and
iterative feedback through compiler-based repair. As a part of the evaluation,
we construct a new dataset called PARATRANS, covering both serial-to-parallel
translation and cross-paradigm transformations.
  Our findings reveal that while off-the-shelf models struggle under the
default settings (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves only 46% compilation and 15%
functional correctness), our UniPar methodology -- combining fine-tuning,
hyperparameter tuning, and compiler-guided repair -- improves performance by up
to 2X (69% compilation and 33% correctness). We believe that our findings will
provide useful insights for researchers to further improve LLMs for the
parallel language translation problem.
  UniPar source code and PARATRANS dataset are available at our GitHub
repository https://github.com/Scientific-Computing-Lab/UniPar_AI.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently emerged as a powerful technique
for real-time, photorealistic rendering by optimizing anisotropic Gaussian
primitives from view-dependent images. While 3D-GS has been extended to
scientific visualization, prior work remains limited to single-GPU settings,
restricting scalability for large datasets on high-performance computing (HPC)
systems. We present a distributed 3D-GS pipeline tailored for HPC. Our approach
partitions data across nodes, trains Gaussian splats in parallel using
multi-nodes and multi-GPUs, and merges splats for global rendering. To
eliminate artifacts, we add ghost cells at partition boundaries and apply
background masks to remove irrelevant pixels. Benchmarks on the
Richtmyer-Meshkov datasets (about 106.7M Gaussians) show up to 3X speedup
across 8 nodes on Polaris while preserving image quality. These results
demonstrate that distributed 3D-GS enables scalable visualization of
large-scale scientific data and provide a foundation for future in situ
applications.

Title: When MoE Meets Blockchain: A Trustworthy Distributed Framework of Large
  Models
Authors: Weihao Zhu, Long Shi, Kang Wei, Zhen Mei, Zhe Wang, Jiaheng Wang, and
  Jun Li
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  As an enabling architecture of Large Models (LMs), Mixture of Experts (MoE)
has become prevalent thanks to its sparsely-gated mechanism, which lowers
computational overhead while maintaining learning performance comparable to
dense LMs. The essence of MoE lies in utilizing a group of neural networks
(called experts) with each specializing in different types of tasks, along with
a trainable gating network that selectively activates a subset of these experts
to handle specific tasks. Traditional cloud-based MoE encounters challenges
such as prolonged response latency, high bandwidth consumption, and data
privacy leakage. To address these issues, researchers have proposed to deploy
MoE over distributed edge networks. However, a key concern of distributed MoE
frameworks is the lack of trust in data interactions among distributed experts
without the surveillance of any trusted authority, and thereby prone to
potential attacks such as data manipulation. In response to the security issues
of traditional distributed MoE, we propose a blockchain-aided trustworthy MoE
(B-MoE) framework that consists of three layers: the edge layer, the blockchain
layer, and the storage layer. In this framework, the edge layer employs the
activated experts downloaded from the storage layer to process the learning
tasks, while the blockchain layer functions as a decentralized trustworthy
network to trace, verify, and record the computational results of the experts
from the edge layer. The experimental results demonstrate that B-MoE is more
robust to data manipulation attacks than traditional distributed MoE during
both the training and inference processes.

  This paper studies how utility graphs decomposition algorithms can be used to
effectively search for Pareto-efficient outcomes in complex automated
negotiation. We propose a number of algorithms that can efficiently handle
high-dimensional utility graphs, and test them on a variety of utility graph
topologies, generated based on state of the art methods for analysing complex
graphs. We show that we can achieve exponential speed-up, for many structures,
even for very large utility graphs. To our knowledge, our approach can handle
the largest utility spaces to date for complex interdependent negotiations, in
terms of number of issues. Moreover, we examine the performance of our
algorithms across two different types of elicitation queries from the
literature: value and comparison queries, thus making a connection between
automated negotiation and the preference elicitation literature.

Title: Statistical Model Checking of NetLogo Models
Authors: Marco Pangallo, Daniele Giachini, Andrea Vandin
Categories: cs.MA econ.GN q-fin.EC
\\
  Agent-based models (ABMs) are gaining increasing traction in several domains,
due to their ability to represent complex systems that are not easily
expressible with classical mathematical models. This expressivity and richness
come at a cost: ABMs can typically be analyzed only through simulation, making
their analysis challenging. Specifically, when studying the output of ABMs, the
analyst is often confronted with practical questions such as: (i) how many
independent replications should be run? (ii) how many initial time steps should
be discarded as a warm-up? (iii) after the warm-up, how long should the model
run? (iv) what are the right parameter values? Analysts usually resort to rules
of thumb and experimentation, which lack statistical rigor. This is mainly
because addressing these points takes time, and analysts prefer to spend their
limited time improving the model. In this paper, we propose a methodology,
drawing on the field of Statistical Model Checking, to automate the process and
provide guarantees of statistical rigor for ABMs written in NetLogo, one of the
most popular ABM platforms. We discuss MultiVeStA, a tool that dramatically
reduces the time and human intervention needed to run statistically rigorous
checks on ABM outputs, and introduce its integration with NetLogo. Using two
ABMs from the NetLogo library, we showcase MultiVeStA's analysis capabilities
for NetLogo ABMs, as well as a novel application to statistically rigorous
calibration. Our tool-chain makes it immediate to perform statistical checks
with NetLogo models, promoting more rigorous and reliable analyses of ABM
outputs.

Title: SafeDiver: Cooperative AUV-USV Assisted Diver Communication via
  Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Tinglong Deng, Hang Tao, Xinxiang Wang, Yinyan Wang, Hanjiang Luo
Categories: cs.MA cs.LG cs.RO
\\
  As underwater human activities are increasing, the demand for underwater
communication service presents a significant challenge. Existing underwater
diver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and
complex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme
that utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and
high-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic
multimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive
communication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using
a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative
movement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can
be achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment
and wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to
coordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to
adaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality
communication between divers and surface platform can be achieved. Through
simulation verification, the proposed scheme can effectively achieve reliable
and high-speed communication for divers.

  Multi-agent debate (MAD) has demonstrated the ability to augment collective
intelligence by scaling test-time compute and leveraging expertise. Current
frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack
integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas,
response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce
MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that
enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144
unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert,
Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3)
discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g.,
Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate.
Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Huggingface dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro,
WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD
configurations. MALLM is tailored towards researchers and provides a window
into the heart of multi-agent debate, facilitating the understanding of its
components and their interplay.

Title: Nash Equilibrium and Belief Evolution in Differential Games
Authors: Jiangjing Zhou, Ovanes Petrosian, Ye Zhang, and Hongwei Gao
Categories: cs.MA cs.GT
\\
  This study investigates differential games with motion-payoff uncertainty in
continuous-time settings. We propose a framework where players update their
beliefs about uncertain parameters using continuous Bayesian updating.
Theoretical proofs leveraging key probability theorems demonstrate that
players' beliefs converge to the true parameter values, ensuring stability and
accuracy in long-term estimations. We further derive Nash Equilibrium
strategies with continuous Bayesian updating for players, emphasizing the role
of belief updates in decision-making processes. Additionally, we establish the
convergence of Nash Equilibrium strategies with continuous Bayesian updating.
The efficacy of both continuous and dynamic Bayesian updating is examined in
the context of pollution control games, showing convergence in players'
estimates under small time intervals in discrete scenarios.

Title: Spectral and Rhythm Features for Audio Classification with Deep
  Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Friedrich Wolf-Monheim
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG eess.AS
\\
  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision. They
can be used not only for conventional digital image material to recognize
patterns, but also for feature extraction from digital imagery representing
spectral and rhythm features extracted from time-domain digital audio signals
for the acoustic classification of sounds. Different spectral and rhythm
feature representations like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCCs), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy
normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams are investigated in terms of the audio
classification performance using a deep convolutional neural network. It can be
clearly shown that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCCs) perform significantly better than the other spectral and
rhythm features investigated in this research for audio classification tasks
using deep CNNs. The experiments were carried out with the aid of the ESC-50
dataset with 2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings.

\\
  Translating software between programming languages is a challenging task, for
which automated techniques have been elusive and hard to scale up to larger
programs. A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to
re-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic
constructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away
from the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall
functionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic
approach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a
framework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level
structure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing
lower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to
the target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different
ways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in
conjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,
skeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual
fragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically
translated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a
whole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of
skeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show
promising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python
programs, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code
fragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual
effort. All the final translations are correct with respect to whole-program
test suites.

  Optimization

Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures

  Stock recommendation is critical in Fintech applications, which use price
series and alternative information to estimate future stock performance.
Although deep learning models are prevalent in stock recommendation systems,
traditional time-series forecasting training often fails to capture stock
trends and rankings simultaneously, which are essential consideration factors
for investors. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL)
framework for stock recommendation, \textbf{M}omentum-\textbf{i}ntegrated
\textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{Stoc}k \textbf{R}ecommendation with Converge-based
Optimization (\textbf{MiM-StocR}). To improve the model's ability to capture
short-term trends, we novelly invoke a momentum line indicator in model
training. To prioritize top-performing stocks and optimize investment
allocation, we propose a list-wise ranking loss function called Adaptive-k
ApproxNDCG. Moreover, due to the volatility and uncertainty of the stock
market, existing MTL frameworks face overfitting issues when applied to stock
time series. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Converge-based
Quad-Balancing (CQB) method. We conducted extensive experiments on three stock
benchmarks: SEE50, CSI 100, and CSI 300. MiM-StocR outperforms state-of-the-art
MTL baselines across both ranking and profitable evaluations.

  Current general-purpose large language models (LLMs) commonly exhibit
knowledge hallucination and insufficient domain-specific adaptability in
domain-specific tasks, limiting their effectiveness in specialized question
answering scenarios. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) effectively tackles
these challenges by integrating external knowledge to enhance accuracy and
relevance. However, traditional RAG still faces limitations in domain knowledge
accuracy and context modeling.To enhance domain-specific question answering
performance, this work focuses on a graph-based RAG framework, emphasizing the
critical role of knowledge graph quality during the generation process. We
propose DSRAG (Domain-Specific RAG), a multimodal knowledge graph-driven
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed for domain-specific
applications. Our approach leverages domain-specific documents as the primary
knowledge source, integrating heterogeneous information such as text, images,
and tables to construct a multimodal knowledge graph covering both conceptual
and instance layers. Building on this foundation, we introduce semantic pruning
and structured subgraph retrieval mechanisms, combining knowledge graph context
and vector retrieval results to guide the language model towards producing more
reliable responses. Evaluations using the Langfuse multidimensional scoring
mechanism show that our method excels in domain-specific question answering,
validating the efficacy of integrating multimodal knowledge graphs with
retrieval-augmented generation.

  Recent advances in generative recommenders adopt a two-stage paradigm: items
are first tokenized into semantic IDs using a pretrained tokenizer, and then
large language models (LLMs) are trained to generate the next item via
sequence-to-sequence modeling. However, these two stages are optimized for
different objectives: semantic reconstruction during tokenizer pretraining
versus user interaction modeling during recommender training. This objective
misalignment leads to two key limitations: (i) suboptimal static tokenization,
where fixed token assignments fail to reflect diverse usage contexts; and (ii)
discarded pretrained semantics, where pretrained knowledge - typically from
language model embeddings - is overwritten during recommender training on user
interactions. To address these limitations, we propose to learn DEcomposed
COntextual Token Representations (DECOR), a unified framework that preserves
pretrained semantics while enhancing the adaptability of token embeddings.
DECOR introduces contextualized token composition to refine token embeddings
based on user interaction context, and decomposed embedding fusion that
integrates pretrained codebook embeddings with newly learned collaborative
embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DECOR
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation
performance. Our code will be made available upon publication.

  New technologies in generative AI can enable deeper analysis into our
nation's supply chains but truly informative insights require the continual
updating and aggregation of massive data in a timely manner. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented analytical opportunities however, their
knowledge base is constrained to the models' last training date, rendering
these capabilities unusable for organizations whose mission impacts rely on
emerging and timely information. This research proposes an innovative approach
to supply chain analysis by integrating emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) preprocessing and retrieval techniques with advanced web-scraping
technologies. Our method aims to reduce latency in incorporating new
information into an augmented-LLM, enabling timely analysis of supply chain
disruptors. Through experimentation, this study evaluates the combinatorial
effects of these techniques towards timeliness and quality trade-offs. Our
results suggest that in applying RAG systems to supply chain analysis,
fine-tuning the embedding retrieval model consistently provides the most
significant performance gains, underscoring the critical importance of
retrieval quality. Adaptive iterative retrieval, which dynamically adjusts
retrieval depth based on context, further enhances performance, especially on
complex sup- ply chain queries. Conversely, fine-tuning the LLM yields limited
improvements and higher resource costs, while techniques such as downward query
abstraction significantly outperforms upward abstraction in practice.

  The increasing sophistication of technology systems makes traditional threat

real time threat intelligence from the National Vulnerability Database and
AlienVault Open Threat Exchange, AegisShield produces streamlined and
accessible threat descriptions. Our assessment of 243 threats from 15 case
studies and over 8000 AI generated threats shows that AegisShield reduces
complexity (p less than 0.001), yields outputs semantically aligned with expert
developed threats (p less than 0.05), and achieves an 85.4 percent success rate
in mapping threats to MITRE ATT&CK techniques (p less than 0.001). Automating
and standardizing threat modeling helps under resourced organizations address
risk earlier and supports wider adoption of secure by design practices.

attention. However, most of them rely on limited network trace sets during
training and overlook the wide-distribution characteristics of real-world
network conditions, resulting in poor generalization in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose SABR, a training
framework that combines behavior cloning (BC) pretraining with reinforcement
learning (RL) fine-tuning. We also introduce benchmarks, ABRBench-3G and
ABRBench-4G+, which provide wide-coverage training traces and dedicated OOD
test sets for assessing robustness to unseen network conditions. Experimental
results demonstrate that SABR achieves the best average rank compared with
Pensieve, Comyco, and NetLLM across the proposed benchmarks. These results
indicate that SABR enables more stable learning across wide distributions and
improves generalization to unseen network conditions.

Title: Distributed Gossip-GAN for Low-overhead CSI Feedback Training in FDD
  mMIMO-OFDM Systems

\\
  The deep autoencoder (DAE) framework has turned out to be efficient in
reducing the channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive
multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) systems. However, these DAE approaches
presented in prior works rely heavily on large-scale data collected through the
base station (BS) for model training, thus rendering excessive bandwidth usage
and data privacy issues, particularly for mMIMO systems. When considering
users' mobility and encountering new channel environments, the existing CSI
feedback models may often need to be retrained. Returning back to previous
environments, however, will make these models perform poorly and face the risk
of catastrophic forgetting. To solve the above challenging problems, we propose
a novel gossiping generative adversarial network (Gossip-GAN)-aided CSI
feedback training framework. Notably, Gossip-GAN enables the CSI feedback
training with low-overhead while preserving users' privacy. Specially, each
user collects a small amount of data to train a GAN model. Meanwhile, a fully
distributed gossip-learning strategy is exploited to avoid model overfitting,
and to accelerate the model training as well. Simulation results demonstrate
that Gossip-GAN can i) achieve a similar CSI feedback accuracy as centralized
training with real-world datasets, ii) address catastrophic forgetting
challenges in mobile scenarios, and iii) greatly reduce the uplink bandwidth
usage. Besides, our results show that the proposed approach possesses an
inherent robustness.

Title: Online Learning Based Efficient Resource Allocation for LoRaWAN Network
Authors: Ruiqi Wang, Jing Ren, Tongyu Song, Wenjun Li, Xiong Wang, Sheng Wang,
  and Shizhong Xu
Categories: cs.NI cs.AI
\\
  The deployment of large-scale LoRaWAN networks requires jointly optimizing
conflicting metrics like Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and Energy Efficiency (EE)
by dynamically allocating transmission parameters, including Carrier Frequency,
Spreading Factor, and Transmission Power. Existing methods often oversimplify
this challenge, focusing on a single metric or lacking the adaptability needed
for dynamic channel environments, leading to suboptimal performance. To address
this, we propose two online learning-based resource allocation frameworks that
intelligently navigate the PDR-EE trade-off. Our foundational proposal, D-LoRa,
is a fully distributed framework that models the problem as a Combinatorial
Multi-Armed Bandit. By decomposing the joint parameter selection and employing
specialized, disaggregated reward functions, D-LoRa dramatically reduces
learning complexity and enables nodes to autonomously adapt to network
dynamics. To further enhance performance in LoRaWAN networks, we introduce
CD-LoRa, a hybrid framework that integrates a lightweight, centralized
initialization phase to perform a one-time, quasi-optimal channel assignment
and action space pruning, thereby accelerating subsequent distributed learning.
Extensive simulations and real-world field experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our frameworks, showing that D-LoRa excels in non-stationary
environments while CD-LoRa achieves the fastest convergence in stationary
conditions. In physical deployments, our methods outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, improving PDR by up to 10.8% and EE by 26.1%, confirming their
practical effectiveness for scalable and efficient LoRaWAN networks.

Title: Towards Scalable O-RAN Resource Management: Graph-Augmented Proximal
  Policy Optimization
Authors: Duc-Thinh Ngo (STACK, LS2N), Kandaraj Piamrat, Ons Aouedi, Thomas
  Hassan, Philippe Raipin-Parv\'edy
Categories: cs.NI cs.AI
\\
  Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architectures enable flexible, scalable,
and cost-efficient mobile networks by disaggregating and virtualizing baseband
functions. However, this flexibility introduces significant challenges for
resource management, requiring joint optimization of functional split selection
and virtualized unit placement under dynamic demands and complex topologies.
Existing solutions often address these aspects separately or lack scalability
in large and real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel
Graph-Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization (GPPO) framework that leverages
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for topology-aware feature extraction and
integrates action masking to efficiently navigate the combinatorial decision
space. Our approach jointly optimizes functional split and placement decisions,
capturing the full complexity of O-RAN resource allocation. Extensive
experiments on both small-and large-scale O-RAN scenarios demonstrate that GPPO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 18% lower
deployment cost and 25% higher reward in generalization tests, while
maintaining perfect reliability. These results highlight the effectiveness and
scalability of GPPO for practical O-RAN deployments.

\\
  Zero-inflated data pose significant challenges in precipitation forecasting
due to the predominance of zeros with sparse non-zero events. To address this,
we propose the Zero Inflation Diffusion Framework (ZIDF), which integrates
Gaussian perturbation for smoothing zero-inflated distributions,
Transformer-based prediction for capturing temporal patterns, and
diffusion-based denoising to restore the original data structure. In our
experiments, we use observational precipitation data collected from South
Australia along with synthetically generated zero-inflated data. Results show
that ZIDF demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple
state-of-the-art precipitation forecasting models, achieving up to 56.7\%
reduction in MSE and 21.1\% reduction in MAE relative to the baseline
Non-stationary Transformer. These findings highlight ZIDF's ability to robustly
handle sparse time series data and suggest its potential generalizability to
other domains where zero inflation is a key challenge.

Title: FEDEXCHANGE: Bridging the Domain Gap in Federated Object Detection for
  Free
Authors: Haolin Yuan, Jingtao Li, Weiming Zhuang, Chen Chen, Lingjuan Lyu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Federated Object Detection (FOD) enables clients to collaboratively train a
global object detection model without accessing their local data from diverse
domains. However, significant variations in environment, weather, and other
domain specific factors hinder performance, making cross domain generalization
a key challenge. Existing FOD methods often overlook the hardware constraints
of edge devices and introduce local training regularizations that incur high
computational costs, limiting real-world applicability. In this paper, we
propose FEDEXCHANGE, a novel FOD framework that bridges domain gaps without
introducing additional local computational overhead. FEDEXCHANGE employs a
server side dynamic model exchange strategy that enables each client to gain
insights from other clients' domain data without direct data sharing.
Specifically, FEDEXCHANGE allows the server to alternate between model
aggregation and model exchange. During aggregation rounds, the server
aggregates all local models as usual. In exchange rounds, FEDEXCHANGE clusters
and exchanges local models based on distance measures, allowing local models to
learn from a variety of domains. As all operations are performed on the server
side, clients can achieve improved cross domain utility without any additional
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FEDEXCHANGE
enhances FOD performance, achieving 1.6X better mean average precision in
challenging domains, such as rainy conditions, while requiring only 0.8X the
computational resources compared to baseline methods.

Title: Retrosynthesis Planning via Worst-path Policy Optimisation in
  Tree-structured MDPs
Authors: Mianchu Wang and Giovanni Montana
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CE
\\
  Retrosynthesis planning aims to decompose target molecules into available
building blocks, forming a synthesis tree where each internal node represents
an intermediate compound and each leaf ideally corresponds to a purchasable
reactant. However, this tree becomes invalid if any leaf node is not a valid
building block, making the planning process vulnerable to the "weakest link" in
the synthetic route. Existing methods often optimise for average performance
across branches, failing to account for this worst-case sensitivity. In this
paper, we reframe retrosynthesis as a worst-path optimisation problem within
tree-structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that this
formulation admits a unique optimal solution and offers monotonic improvement
guarantees. Building on this insight, we introduce Interactive Retrosynthesis
Planning (InterRetro), a method that interacts with the tree MDP, learns a
value function for worst-path outcomes, and improves its policy through
self-imitation, preferentially reinforcing past decisions with high estimated
advantage. Empirically, InterRetro achieves state-of-the-art results, solving
100% of targets on the Retro*-190 benchmark, shortening synthetic routes by
4.9%, and achieving promising performance using only 10% of the training data -
representing a significant advance in computational retrosynthesis planning.

Title: An Internet of Intelligent Things Framework for Decentralized
  Heterogeneous Platforms
Authors: Vadim Allayev and Mahbubur Rahman
Categories: cs.NI cs.AI
Comments: 11 pages
\\
  Internet of Intelligent Things (IoIT), an emerging field, combines the
utility of Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the innovation of embedded AI
algorithms. However, it does not come without challenges, and struggles
regarding available computing resources, energy supply, and storage
limitations. In particular, many impediments to IoIT are linked to the
energy-efficient deployment of machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models
in embedded devices. Research has been conducted to design energy-efficient
IoIT platforms, but these papers often focus on centralized systems, in which
some central entity processes all the data and coordinates actions. This can be
problematic, e.g., serve as bottleneck or lead to security concerns. In a
decentralized system, nodes/devices would self-organize and make their own
decisions. Therefore, to address such issues, we propose a heterogeneous,
decentralized sensing and monitoring IoIT peer-to-peer mesh network system
model. Nodes in the network will coordinate towards several optimization goals:
reliability, energy efficiency, and latency. The system employs federated
learning to train nodes in a distributed manner, metaheuristics to optimize
task allocation and routing paths, and multi-objective optimization to balance
conflicting performance goals.

\\
  Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks (HetVNets) play a key role by stacking
different communication technologies such as sub-6GHz, mm-wave and DSRC to meet
diverse connectivity needs of 5G/B5G vehicular networks. HetVNet helps address
the humongous user demands-but maintaining a steady connection in a highly
mobile, real-world conditions remain a challenge. Though there has been ample
of studies on beam prediction models a dedicated solution for HetVNets is
sparsely explored. Hence, it is the need of the hour to develop a reliable beam
prediction solution, specifically for HetVNets. This paper introduces a
lightweight deep learning-based solution termed-"CAR-BRAINet" which consists of
convolutional neural networks with a powerful multi-head attention (MHA)
mechanism. Existing literature on beam prediction is largely studied under a
limited, idealised vehicular scenario, often overlooking the real-time
complexities and intricacies of vehicular networks. Therefore, this study aims
to mimic the complexities of a real-time driving scenario by incorporating key
factors such as prominent MAC protocols-3GPP-C-V2X and IEEE 802.11BD, the
effect of Doppler shifts under high velocity and varying distance and SNR
levels into three high-quality dynamic datasets pertaining to urban, rural and
highway vehicular networks. CAR-BRAINet performs effectively across all the
vehicular scenarios, demonstrating precise beam prediction with minimal beam
overhead and a steady improvement of 17.9422% on the spectral efficiency over
the existing methods. Thus, this study justifies the effectiveness of
CAR-BRAINet in complex HetVNets, offering promising performance without relying
on the location angle and antenna dimensions of the mobile users, and thereby
reducing the redundant sensor-latency.

\\
  The stability of recursively trained large language models (LLMs) is a
foundational problem for AI safety. Prevailing theory predicts model collapse,
a progressive degradation when models are trained on their own output. We
challenge this narrative by introducing a selective feedback mechanism.
Contrary to expectation, instead of merely slowing decay, our experiments
provide strong evidence that this pressure reverses it, inducing a
statistically significant performance improvement in a Gemma 2B model on a
complex summarization task. We name this phenomenon the Anti-Ouroboros Effect.
We contrast this with a foundational experiment using a simple classifier,
where the theoretical degenerative loop was validated, highlighting the unique
dynamics of high-dimensional models. Our findings establish that systemic
resilience can be an emergent property of LLMs under simple selection pressure,
suggesting a powerful and scalable principle for developing safer and more
robust AI systems. Across five generations, a quality-filtered condition
improved by 6.6% in ROUGE-L F1 score, whereas an unfiltered control degraded by
3.5% and a random-filter control degraded by 4.2%

Title: FireGNN: Neuro-Symbolic Graph Neural Networks with Trainable Fuzzy Rules
  for Interpretable Medical Image Classification
Authors: Prajit Sengupta and Islem Rekik
Categories: eess.IV cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Medical image classification requires not only high predictive performance
but also interpretability to ensure clinical trust and adoption. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures
within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting
transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we
present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that
integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification.
These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering
coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness
parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore
auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity
entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning.
Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST
benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating
interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first
integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.

Title: LogGuardQ: A Cognitive-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning Framework for
  Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection in Security Logs
Authors: Umberto Gon\c{c}alves de Sousa
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR
Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision-making, but
traditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and
adaptability in dynamic environments. This study presents LogGuardQ (Adaptive
Log Guard with Cognitive enhancement), a novel framework that integrates a
dual-memory system inspired by human cognition and adaptive exploration
strategies driven by temperature decay and curiosity. Evaluated on a dataset of
1,000,000 simulated access logs with 47.9% anomalies over 20,000 episodes,
LogGuardQ achieves a 96.0% detection rate (versus 93.0% for DQN and 47.1% for
PPO), with precision of 0.4776, recall of 0.9996, and an F1-score of 0.6450.
The mean reward is 20.34 \pm 44.63 across all episodes (versus 18.80 \pm 43.98
for DQN and -0.17 \pm 23.79 for PPO), with an average of 5.0 steps per episode
(constant across models). Graphical analyses, including learning curves
smoothed with a Savgol filter (window=501, polynomial=2), variance trends,
action distributions, and cumulative detections, demonstrate LogGuardQ's
superior stability and efficiency. Statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U) confirm
significant performance advantages (e.g., p = 0.0002 vs. DQN with negligible
effect size, p < 0.0001 vs. PPO with medium effect size, and p < 0.0001 for DQN
vs. PPO with small effect size). By bridging cognitive science and RL,
LogGuardQ offers a scalable approach to adaptive learning in uncertain
environments, with potential applications in cybersecurity, intrusion
detection, and decision-making under uncertainty.

  of Informatics in Education - RBIE
\\
  The increasing digitalization of education presents unprecedented
opportunities for data-driven personalization, yet it introduces significant
student data privacy challenges. Conventional recommender systems rely on
centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection
regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and
evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The
approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features
from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative
analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx
as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous
student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model
achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28\%, corresponding to 82.85\% of
the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings
validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content
recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our
work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy
dilemma in modern educational platforms.

Title: A Comparative Benchmark of Federated Learning Strategies for Mortality
  Prediction on Heterogeneous and Imbalanced Clinical Data
Authors: Rodrigo Tertulino
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY
Comments: This has been preparing to be submitted to the Journal of the
  Brazilian Computer Society (JBCS)
\\
  Machine learning models hold significant potential for predicting in-hospital
mortality, yet data privacy constraints and the statistical heterogeneity of
real-world clinical data often hamper their development. Federated Learning
(FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but its performance under
non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) and imbalanced conditions
requires rigorous investigation. The study presents a comparative benchmark of
five federated learning strategies: FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdagrad, FedAdam, and
FedCluster for mortality prediction. Using the large-scale MIMIC-IV dataset, we
simulate a realistic non-IID environment by partitioning data by clinical care
unit. To address the inherent class imbalance of the task, the SMOTE-Tomek
technique is applied to each client's local training data. Our experiments,
conducted over 50 communication rounds, reveal that the regularization-based
strategy, FedProx, consistently outperformed other methods, achieving the
highest F1-Score of 0.8831 while maintaining stable convergence. While the
baseline FedAvg was the most computationally efficient, its predictive
performance was substantially lower. Our findings indicate that
regularization-based FL algorithms like FedProx offer a more robust and
effective solution for heterogeneous and imbalanced clinical prediction tasks
than standard or server-side adaptive aggregation methods. The work provides a
crucial empirical benchmark for selecting appropriate FL strategies for
real-world healthcare applications.

  Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) issue high-intensity voice commands in dense
airspace, where accurate workload modeling is critical for safety and
efficiency. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that
integrates structured data, trajectory sequences, and image features to
estimate two key parameters in the ATCO command lifecycle: the time offset
between a command and the resulting aircraft maneuver, and the command
duration. A high-quality dataset was constructed, with maneuver points detected
using sliding window and histogram-based methods. A CNN-Transformer ensemble
model was developed for accurate, generalizable, and interpretable predictions.
By linking trajectories to voice commands, this work offers the first model of
its kind to support intelligent command generation and provides practical value

Title: From Predictions to Explanations: Explainable AI for Autism Diagnosis
  and Identification of Critical Brain Regions
Authors: Kush Gupta, Amir Aly, Emmanuel Ifeachor, Rohit Shankar
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition
characterized by atypical brain maturation. However, the adaptation of transfer
learning paradigms in machine learning for ASD research remains notably
limited. In this study, we propose a computer-aided diagnostic framework with
two modules. This chapter presents a two-module framework combining deep
learning and explainable AI for ASD diagnosis. The first module leverages a
deep learning model fine-tuned through cross-domain transfer learning for ASD
classification. The second module focuses on interpreting the model decisions
and identifying critical brain regions. To achieve this, we employed three
explainable AI (XAI) techniques: saliency mapping, Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. This
framework demonstrates that cross-domain transfer learning can effectively
address data scarcity in ASD research. In addition, by applying three
established explainability techniques, the approach reveals how the model makes
diagnostic decisions and identifies brain regions most associated with ASD.
These findings were compared against established neurobiological evidence,
highlighting strong alignment and reinforcing the clinical relevance of the
proposed approach.

  Learning on Frequency-enhanced Brain Networks
Authors: Mujie Liu, Mengchu Zhu, Qichao Dong, Ting Dang, Jiangang Ma, Jing Ren

Categories: eess.IV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Psychiatric disorders involve complex neural activity changes, with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data serving as key diagnostic
evidence. However, data scarcity and the diverse nature of fMRI information
pose significant challenges. While graph-based self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods have shown promise in brain network analysis, they primarily focus on
time-domain representations, often overlooking the rich information embedded in
the frequency domain. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Frequency-Enhanced Network (FENet), a novel SSL framework specially designed
for fMRI data that integrates time-domain and frequency-domain information to
improve psychiatric disorder detection in small-sample datasets. FENet
constructs multi-view brain networks based on the inherent properties of fMRI
data, explicitly incorporating frequency information into the learning process
of representation. Additionally, it employs domain-specific encoders to capture
temporal-spectral characteristics, including an efficient frequency-domain
encoder that highlights disease-relevant frequency features. Finally, FENet
introduces a domain consistency-guided learning objective, which balances the
utilization of diverse information and generates frequency-enhanced brain graph
representations. Experiments on two real-world medical datasets demonstrate
that FENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining strong
performance in minimal data conditions. Furthermore, we analyze the correlation
between various frequency-domain features and psychiatric disorders,
emphasizing the critical role of high-frequency information in disorder
detection.

Title: Resource-Aware Neural Network Pruning Using Graph-based Reinforcement
  Learning
Authors: Dieter Balemans, Thomas Huybrechts, Jan Steckel, Siegfried Mercelis
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  This paper presents a novel approach to neural network pruning by integrating
a graph-based observation space into an AutoML framework to address the
limitations of existing methods. Traditional pruning approaches often depend on
hand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to
suboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework
transforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the
target neural network that captures complete topological relationships between
layers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a
global view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph
Attention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph
representation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action
space we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary
action spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance
criteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions.
These contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process
(CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while
adhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates. For this, we
design a self-competition reward system that encourages the agent to outperform
its previous best performance while satisfying the defined constraints. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The experiments
show that our method consistently outperforms traditional pruning techniques,
showing state-of-the-art results while learning task-specific pruning
strategies that identify functionally redundant connections beyond simple
weight magnitude considerations.

  Urban spatio-temporal data present unique challenges for predictive analytics
due to their dynamic and complex nature. We introduce STM-Graph, an open-source
Python framework that transforms raw spatio-temporal urban event data into
graph representations suitable for Graph Neural Network (GNN) training and
prediction. STM-Graph integrates diverse spatial mapping methods, urban
features from OpenStreetMap, multiple GNN models, comprehensive visualization
tools, and a graphical user interface (GUI) suitable for professional and
non-professional users. This modular and extensible framework facilitates rapid
experimentation and benchmarking. It allows integration of new mapping methods
and custom models, making it a valuable resource for researchers and
practitioners in urban computing. The source code of the framework and GUI are
available at: https://github.com/Ahghaffari/stm_graph and

Title: Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting and Mode Collapse in Text-to-Image
  Diffusion via Latent Replay
Authors: Aoi Otani
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Continual learning -- the ability to acquire knowledge incrementally without
forgetting previous skills -- is fundamental to natural intelligence. While the
human brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with
"catastrophic forgetting," where learning new tasks erases previously acquired
knowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion
models, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models
face "mode collapse," where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over
time. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a
neuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods
mitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically
requiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only
compact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal
architecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity
patterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving
critical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual
concepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing
methods in maintaining model versatility. After learning all concepts, our
approach retained 77.59% Image Alignment (IA) on the earliest concept, 14%
higher than baseline methods, while maintaining diverse outputs. Surprisingly,
random selection of stored latent examples outperforms similarity-based
strategies. Our findings suggest that Latent Replay enables efficient continual
learning for generative AI models, paving the way for personalized
text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive
computational costs.

Title: Dynamic Adaptive Shared Experts with Grouped Multi-Head Attention
  Mixture of Experts
Authors: Cheng Li and Jiexiong Liu and Yixuan Chen and Jie ji
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Transformer models based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture have
made significant progress in long-sequence modeling, but existing models still
have shortcomings in computational efficiency and the ability to capture
long-range dependencies, especially in terms of the dynamic adaptability of
expert resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive Shared
Expert and Grouped Multi-Head Attention Hybrid Model (DASG-MoE) to enhance
long-sequence modeling capabilities by integrating three modules. First, we
employ the Grouped Multi-Head Attention (GMHA) mechanism to effectively reduce
the computational complexity of long sequences. By parallel processing through
sequence grouping, local sliding window attention, and feature aggregation, we
address long-range dependency issues and the model's lack of generalization for
local information. Second, we design a Dual-Scale Shared Expert Structure
(DSSE), where shallow experts use lightweight computations to quickly respond
to low-dimensional features, while deep experts process high-dimensional
complex semantics through pre-training transfer and post-training optimization,
achieving a dynamic balance between efficiency and accuracy. Third, we propose
a hierarchical Adaptive Dynamic Routing (ADR) mechanism that dynamically
selects expert levels based on feature complexity and task requirements, and
optimizes resource allocation through a local expert activation strategy.
Experiments on multiple long-sequence benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
DASG-MoE model outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Title: FinXplore: An Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for
  Balancing and Discovering Investment Opportunities
Authors: Himanshu Choudhary, Arishi Orra, Manoj Thakur
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Portfolio optimization is essential for balancing risk and return in
financial decision-making. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has stood out as a
cutting-edge tool for portfolio optimization that learns dynamic asset
allocation using trial-and-error interactions. However, most DRL-based methods
are restricted to allocating assets within a pre-defined investment universe
and overlook exploring new opportunities. This study introduces an investment
landscape that integrates exploiting existing assets with exploring new
investment opportunities in an extended universe. The proposed approach
leverages two DRL agents and dynamically balances these objectives to adapt to
evolving markets while enhancing portfolio performance. One agent allocates
assets within the existing universe, while another assists in exploring new
opportunities in the extended universe. The effciency of the proposed
methodology is determined using two real-world market data sets. The
experiments demonstrate the superiority of the suggested approach against the
state-of-the-art portfolio strategies and baseline methods.

Title: Decoupling the "What" and "Where" With Polar Coordinate Positional
  Embeddings
Authors: Anand Gopalakrishnan, Robert Csord\'as, J\"urgen Schmidhuber, Michael
  C. Mozer
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  The attention mechanism in a Transformer architecture matches key to query
based on both content -- the what -- and position in a sequence -- the where.
We present an analysis indicating that what and where are entangled in the
popular RoPE rotary position embedding. This entanglement can impair
performance particularly when decisions require independent matches on these
two factors. We propose an improvement to RoPE, which we call Polar Coordinate
Position Embeddings or PoPE, that eliminates the what-where confound. PoPE is
far superior on a diagnostic task requiring indexing solely by position or by
content. On autoregressive sequence modeling in music, genomic, and natural
language domains, Transformers using PoPE as the positional encoding scheme
outperform baselines using RoPE with respect to evaluation loss (perplexity)
and downstream task performance. On language modeling, these gains persist
across model scale, from 124M to 774M parameters. Crucially, PoPE shows strong
zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities, whereas RoPE's performance
degrades significantly on longer sequences at test time without fine tuning or
the use of position-interpolation methods.

Title: Semantic-guided LoRA Parameters Generation
Authors: Miaoge Li, Yang Chen, Zhijie Rao, Can Jiang, Jingcai Guo
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 19 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated strong generalization
capabilities across a variety of tasks for efficiently fine-tuning AI models,
especially on resource-constrained edges. However, in real-world applications,
edge users often exhibit task-specific preferences that are difficult to handle
with a unified model trained under a closed-world assumption, and the challenge
may further increase when there are significant domain shifts between training
and deployment. Meanwhile, retraining/fine-tuning models for each user is also
impractical due to its cost-intensive nature and privacy concerns over raw data
utilization from edges. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-guided
LoRA Parameter Generation (SG-LoRA), the first of its kind framework to
efficiently produce user-specific LoRA parameters without any additional
training on user tasks or access to user-specific data. Concretely, SG-LoRA
uses task descriptions as the semantic bridge, measuring their proximity to a
set of known expert tasks in a shared embedding space. Based on this semantic
guidance, it models the target task's LoRA parameter distribution to generate
high-performing parameters for novel tasks. SG-LoRA enables the real-time
construction of LoRA models aligned with individual intents by distilling
knowledge from prominent LoRA experts and, meanwhile, offering a
privacy-preserving solution for personalized model adaptation in a novel
zero-shot open-world setting proposed in this work. Extensive experiments on
multiple challenging tasks confirm the superior performance and remarkable
adaptability of SG-LoRA. Code is available at

Title: On Using Large-Batches in Federated Learning
Authors: Sahil Tyagi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.DC
\\
  Efficient Federated learning (FL) is crucial for training deep networks over
devices with limited compute resources and bounded networks. With the advent of
big data, devices either generate or collect multimodal data to train either
generic or local-context aware networks, particularly when data privacy and
locality is vital. FL algorithms generally trade-off between parallel and
statistical performance, improving model quality at the cost of higher
communication frequency, or vice versa. Under frequent synchronization
settings, FL over a large cluster of devices may perform more work per-training
iteration by processing a larger global batch-size, thus attaining considerable
training speedup. However, this may result in poor test performance (i.e., low
test loss or accuracy) due to generalization degradation issues associated with
large-batch training. To address these challenges with large-batches, this work
proposes our vision of exploiting the trade-offs between small and large-batch
training, and explore new directions to enjoy both the parallel scaling of
large-batches and good generalizability of small-batch training. For the same
number of iterations, we observe that our proposed large-batch training
technique attains about 32.33% and 3.74% higher test accuracy than small-batch
training in ResNet50 and VGG11 models respectively.

Title: DualAlign: Generating Clinically Grounded Synthetic Data
Authors: Rumeng Li, Xun Wang, Hong Yu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL cs.CY
\\
  Synthetic clinical data are increasingly important for advancing AI in
healthcare, given strict privacy constraints on real-world EHRs, limited
availability of annotated rare-condition data, and systemic biases in
observational datasets. While large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent
clinical text, producing synthetic data that is both realistic and clinically
meaningful remains challenging. We introduce DualAlign, a framework that
enhances statistical fidelity and clinical plausibility through dual alignment:
(1) statistical alignment, which conditions generation on patient demographics
and risk factors; and (2) semantic alignment, which incorporates real-world
symptom trajectories to guide content generation. Using Alzheimer's disease
(AD) as a case study, DualAlign produces context-grounded symptom-level
sentences that better reflect real-world clinical documentation. Fine-tuning an
LLaMA 3.1-8B model with a combination of DualAlign-generated and
human-annotated data yields substantial performance gains over models trained
on gold data alone or unguided synthetic baselines. While DualAlign does not
fully capture longitudinal complexity, it offers a practical approach for
generating clinically grounded, privacy-preserving synthetic data to support
low-resource clinical text analysis.

Title: EchoLeak: The First Real-World Zero-Click Prompt Injection Exploit in a

Comments: 8 pages content, 1 page references, 2 figures, Published at AAAI Fall
  Symposium Series 2025
\\
  Large language model (LLM) assistants are increasingly integrated into
enterprise workflows, raising new security concerns as they bridge internal and
external data sources. This paper presents an in-depth case study of EchoLeak
(CVE-2025-32711), a zero-click prompt injection vulnerability in Microsoft 365
Copilot that enabled remote, unauthenticated data exfiltration via a single
crafted email. By chaining multiple bypasses-evading Microsofts XPIA (Cross
Prompt Injection Attempt) classifier, circumventing link redaction with
reference-style Markdown, exploiting auto-fetched images, and abusing a
Microsoft Teams proxy allowed by the content security policy-EchoLeak achieved
full privilege escalation across LLM trust boundaries without user interaction.
We analyze why existing defenses failed, and outline a set of engineering
mitigations including prompt partitioning, enhanced input/output filtering,
provenance-based access control, and strict content security policies. Beyond
the specific exploit, we derive generalizable lessons for building secure AI
copilots, emphasizing the principle of least privilege, defense-in-depth
architectures, and continuous adversarial testing. Our findings establish
prompt injection as a practical, high-severity vulnerability class in
production AI systems and provide a blueprint for defending against future
AI-native threats.

  Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks remain a serious threat to
online infrastructure, often bypassing detection by altering traffic in subtle
ways. We present a method using hive-plot sequences of network data and a 3D
convolutional neural network (3D CNN) to classify DDoS traffic with high
accuracy. Our system relies on three main ideas: (1) using spatio-temporal
hive-plot encodings to set a pattern-recognition baseline, (2) applying
adversarial training with FGSM and PGD alongside spatial noise and image
shifts, and (3) analyzing frame-wise predictions to find early signals. On a
benchmark dataset, our method lifts adversarial accuracy from 50-55% to over
93% while maintaining clean-sample performance. Frames 3-4 offer strong
predictive signals, showing early-stage classification is possible.

Title: ASL360: AI-Enabled Adaptive Streaming of Layered 360{\deg} Video over
  UAV-assisted Wireless Networks
Authors: Alireza Mohammadhosseini, Jacob Chakareski, Nicholas Mastronarde
Categories: cs.NI cs.AI cs.MM
Comments: This paper has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE Global
  Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025
\\
  We propose ASL360, an adaptive deep reinforcement learning-based scheduler
for on-demand 360{\deg} video streaming to mobile VR users in next generation
wireless networks. We aim to maximize the overall Quality of Experience (QoE)
of the users served over a UAV-assisted 5G wireless network. Our system model
comprises a macro base station (MBS) and a UAV-mounted base station which both
deploy mm-Wave transmission to the users. The 360{\deg} video is encoded into
dependent layers and segmented tiles, allowing a user to schedule downloads of
each layer's segments. Furthermore, each user utilizes multiple buffers to
store the corresponding video layer's segments. We model the scheduling
decision as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent
selects Base or Enhancement layers to maximize the QoE and use a policy
gradient-based method (PPO) to find the optimal policy. Additionally, we
implement a dynamic adjustment mechanism for cost components, allowing the
system to adaptively balance and prioritize the video quality, buffer
occupancy, and quality change based on real-time network and streaming session
conditions. We demonstrate that ASL360 significantly improves the QoE,
achieving approximately 2 dB higher average video quality, 80% lower average
rebuffering time, and 57% lower video quality variation, relative to
competitive baseline methods. Our results show the effectiveness of our layered
and adaptive approach in enhancing the QoE in immersive videostreaming
applications, particularly in dynamic and challenging network environments.

Title: Biomarkers of brain diseases

Categories: q-bio.NC cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Despite the diversity of brain data acquired and advanced AI-based algorithms
to analyze them, brain features are rarely used in clinics for diagnosis and
prognosis. Here we argue that the field continues to rely on cohort comparisons
to seek biomarkers, despite the well-established degeneracy of brain features.
Using a thought experiment, we show that more data and more powerful algorithms
will not be sufficient to identify biomarkers of brain diseases. We argue that
instead of comparing patient versus healthy controls using single data type, we
should use multimodal (e.g. brain activity, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators,
brain imaging) and longitudinal brain data to guide the grouping before
defining multidimensional biomarkers for brain diseases.

  This position paper presents AVEC (Adaptive Verifiable Edge Control), a
framework for bootstrapping privacy for local language models by enforcing
privacy at the edge with explicit verifiability for delegated queries. AVEC
introduces an adaptive budgeting algorithm that allocates per-query
differential privacy parameters based on sensitivity, local confidence, and
historical usage, and uses verifiable transformation with on-device integrity
checks. We formalize guarantees using R\'enyi differential privacy with
odometer-based accounting, and establish utility ceilings, delegation-leakage
bounds, and impossibility results for deterministic gating and hash-only
certification. Our evaluation is simulation-based by design to study mechanism
behavior and accounting; we do not claim deployment readiness or task-level
utility with live LLMs. The contribution is a conceptual architecture and
theoretical foundation that chart a pathway for empirical follow-up on
privately bootstrapping local LLMs.

  Trajectory prediction serves as a critical functionality in autonomous
driving, enabling the anticipation of future motion paths for traffic
participants such as vehicles and pedestrians, which is essential for driving
safety. Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy,
they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of
interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak
generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models
(LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This
survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for
trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs
facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing
prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article
highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal
fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both
vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key
challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world
robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including
low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.

  Reliable data quality is crucial for downstream analysis of tabular datasets,
yet rule-based validation often struggles with inefficiency, human
intervention, and high computational costs. We present a three-stage framework
that combines statistical inliner detection with LLM-driven rule and code
generation. After filtering data samples through traditional clustering, we
iteratively prompt LLMs to produce semantically valid quality rules and
synthesize their executable validators through code-generating LLMs. To
generate reliable quality rules, we aid LLMs with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) by leveraging external knowledge sources and domain-specific
few-shot examples. Robust guardrails ensure the accuracy and consistency of
both rules and code snippets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets
confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

  Analysis

Categories: q-bio.GN cs.AI
Comments: 14 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, 40 references
\\
  The gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for uncovering the
molecular functions associated with a group of genes. Recently, LLM-powered
methods have emerged to annotate gene sets with biological functions together
with coherent explanatory insights. However, existing studies primarily focus
on proprietary models, which have been shown to outperform their open-source
counterparts despite concerns over cost and data privacy. Furthermore, no
research has investigated the application of advanced reasoning strategies to
the GSA task. To address this gap, we introduce Gene-R1, a data-augmented
learning framework that equips lightweight and open-source LLMs with
step-by-step reasoning capabilities tailored to GSA. Experiments on 1,508
in-distribution gene sets demonstrate that Gene-R1 achieves substantial
performance gains, matching commercial LLMs. On 106 out-of-distribution gene
sets, Gene-R1 performs comparably to both commercial and large-scale LLMs,
exhibiting robust generalizability across diverse gene sources.

Title: Aesthetic Experience and Educational Value in Co-creating Art with
  Generative AI: Evidence from a Survey of Young Learners
Authors: Chengyuan Zhang, Suzhe Xu
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  This study investigates the aesthetic experience and educational value of
collaborative artmaking with generative artificial intelligence (AI) among
young learners and art students. Based on a survey of 112 participants, we
examine how human creators renegotiate their roles, how conventional notions of
originality are challenged, how the creative process is transformed, and how
aesthetic judgment is formed in human--AI co-creation. Empirically,
participants generally view AI as a partner that stimulates ideation and
expands creative boundaries rather than a passive tool, while simultaneously
voicing concerns about stylistic homogenization and the erosion of traditional
authorship. Theoretically, we synthesize Dewey's aesthetics of experience,
Ihde's postphenomenology, and actor--network theory (ANT) into a single
analytical framework to unpack the dynamics between human creators and AI as a
non-human actant. Findings indicate (i) a fluid subjectivity in which creators
shift across multiple stances (director, dialogic partner, discoverer); (ii) an
iterative, dialogic workflow (intent--generate--select--refine) that centers
critical interpretation; and (iii) an educational value shift from technical
skill training toward higher-order competencies such as critical judgment,
cross-modal ideation, and reflexivity. We argue that arts education should
cultivate a \emph{critical co-creation} stance toward technology, guiding
learners to collaborate with AI while preserving human distinctiveness in
concept formation, judgment, and meaning-making.

Title: The Coding Limits of Robust Watermarking for Generative Models
Authors: Danilo Francati, Yevin Nikhel Goonatilake, Shubham Pawar, Daniele
  Venturi, Giuseppe Ateniese
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  We prove a sharp threshold for the robustness of cryptographic watermarking
for generative models. This is achieved by introducing a coding abstraction,
which we call messageless secret-key codes, that formalizes sufficient and
necessary requirements of robust watermarking: soundness, tamper detection, and
pseudorandomness. Thus, we establish that robustness has a precise limit: For
binary outputs no scheme can survive if more than half of the encoded bits are
modified, and for an alphabet of size q the corresponding threshold is
$(1-1/q)$ of the symbols.
  Complementing this impossibility, we give explicit constructions that meet
the bound up to a constant slack. For every ${\delta} > 0$, assuming
pseudorandom functions and access to a public counter, we build linear-time
codes that tolerate up to $(1/2)(1-{\delta})$ errors in the binary case and
$(1-1/q)(1-{\delta})$ errors in the $q$-ary case. Together with the lower
bound, these yield the maximum robustness achievable under standard
cryptographic assumptions.
  We then test experimentally whether this limit appears in practice by looking
at the recent watermarking for images of Gunn, Zhao, and Song (ICLR 2025). We
show that a simple crop and resize operation reliably flipped about half of the
latent signs and consistently prevented belief-propagation decoding from
recovering the codeword, erasing the watermark while leaving the image visually
intact.

identifying the threshold at which robustness fails, constructions that achieve
it, and an experimental confirmation that the threshold is already reached in
practice.

  Exploratory learning environments (ELEs), such as simulation-based platforms
and open-ended science curricula, promote hands-on exploration and
problem-solving but make it difficult for teachers to gain timely insights into
students' conceptual understanding. This paper presents LearnLens, a generative
AI (GenAI)-enhanced teacher-facing dashboard designed to support problem-based
instruction in middle school science. LearnLens processes students' open-ended
responses from digital assessments to provide various insights, including
sample responses, word clouds, bar charts, and AI-generated summaries. These
features elucidate students' thinking, enabling teachers to adjust their
instruction based on emerging patterns of understanding. The dashboard was
informed by teacher input during professional development sessions and
implemented within a middle school Earth science curriculum. We report insights
from teacher interviews that highlight the dashboard's usability and potential
to guide teachers' instruction in the classroom.

Title: Smart Trial: Evaluating the Use of Large Language Models for Recruiting
  Clinical Trial Participants via Social Media
Authors: Xiaofan Zhou, Zisu Wang, Janice Krieger, Mohan Zalake and Lu Cheng
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Clinical trials (CT) are essential for advancing medical research and
treatment, yet efficiently recruiting eligible participants -- each of whom
must meet complex eligibility criteria -- remains a significant challenge.
Traditional recruitment approaches, such as advertisements or electronic health
record screening within hospitals, are often time-consuming and geographically
constrained. This work addresses the recruitment challenge by leveraging the
vast amount of health-related information individuals share on social media
platforms. With the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) capable
of sophisticated text understanding, we pose the central research question: Can
LLM-driven tools facilitate CT recruitment by identifying potential
participants through their engagement on social media? To investigate this
question, we introduce TRIALQA, a novel dataset comprising two social media
collections from the subreddits on colon cancer and prostate cancer. Using
eligibility criteria from public real-world CTs, experienced annotators are
hired to annotate TRIALQA to indicate (1) whether a social media user meets a
given eligibility criterion and (2) the user's stated reasons for interest in
participating in CT. We benchmark seven widely used LLMs on these two
prediction tasks, employing six distinct training and inference strategies. Our
extensive experiments reveal that, while LLMs show considerable promise, they
still face challenges in performing the complex, multi-hop reasoning needed to
accurately assess eligibility criteria.

Title: Machine Unlearning for Responsible and Adaptive AI in Education
Authors: Betty Mayeku, Sandra Hummel and Parisa Memarmoshrefi
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
Comments: Accepted paper - ESORICS 2025 - International Workshop on Secure and
  Trustworthy Machine Unlearning Systems (STMUS)
\\
  The concept of Machine Unlearning (MU) has gained popularity in various
domains due to its ability to address several issues in Machine Learning (ML)
models, particularly those related to privacy, security, bias mitigation, and
adaptability. With these abilities, MU is evolving into a promising technology
in upholding Responsible AI principles and optimizing ML models' performance.
However, despite its promising potential, the concept has not received much
attention in the education sector. In an attempt to encourage further uptake of
this promising technology in the educational landscape, this paper demonstrates
that MU indeed has great potential to serve as a practical mechanism for
operationalizing Responsible AI principles as well as an essential tool for
Adaptive AI within the educational application domain hence fostering trust in
AI-driven educational systems. Through a structured review of 42 peer-reviewed
sources, we identify four domains where MU holds particular promise namely
privacy protection, resilience against adversarial inputs, mitigation of
systemic bias, and adaptability in evolving learning contexts. We
systematically explore these potentials and their interventions to core
challenges in ML-based education systems. As a conceptual contribution, we
present a reference Machine Unlearning application architecture for Responsible
and Adaptive AI (MU-RAAI) in education context.

Title: Assisting the Grading of a Handwritten General Chemistry Exam with
  Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Jan Cvengros, Gerd Kortemeyer
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  We explore the effectiveness and reliability of an artificial intelligence
(AI)-based grading system for a handwritten general chemistry exam, comparing
AI-assigned scores to human grading across various types of questions. Exam
pages and grading rubrics were uploaded as images to account for chemical
reaction equations, short and long open-ended answers, numerical and symbolic
answer derivations, drawing, and sketching in pencil-and-paper format. Using
linear regression analyses and psychometric evaluations, the investigation
reveals high agreement between AI and human graders for textual and chemical
reaction questions, while highlighting lower reliability for numerical and
graphical tasks. The findings emphasize the necessity for human oversight to
ensure grading accuracy, based on selective filtering. The results indicate
promising applications for AI in routine assessment tasks, though careful
consideration must be given to student perceptions of fairness and trust in
integrating AI-based grading into educational practice.

\\
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping
today's business practices, however, their adoption within small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) raises significant technical, ethical and trust
issues. This paper proposes a structured, multi-phased framework designed to
embed trust and ethical principles throughout the AI lifecycle for their secure
and responsible use in SMEs. Structured around four pillars, i.e., Data,
Algorithms, Human oversight, and Model Architecture, the framework bridges
theoretical ethical principles with operational practice, enhancing AI
capabilities in diverse SME applications. Ultimately, this paper offers a
structured roadmap for responsible AI adoption, framing trust and ethics as a
catalyst for resilience, competitiveness, and sustainable innovation in SMEs.

\\
  Real-time voice interfaces using multimodal Generative AI (GenAI) can
potentially address the accessibility needs of novice programmers with
disabilities (e.g., related to vision). Yet, little is known about how novices
interact with GenAI tools and their feedback quality in the form of audio
output. This paper analyzes audio dialogues from nine 9th-grade students using
a voice-enabled tutor (powered by OpenAI's Realtime API) in an authentic
classroom setting while learning Python. We examined the students' voice
prompts and AI's responses (1210 messages) by using qualitative coding. We also
gathered students' perceptions via the Partner Modeling Questionnaire. The
GenAI Voice Tutor primarily offered feedback on mistakes and next steps, but
its correctness was limited (71.4% correct out of 416 feedback outputs).
Quality issues were observed, particularly when the AI attempted to utter
programming code elements. Students used the GenAI voice tutor primarily for
debugging. They perceived it as competent, only somewhat human-like, and
flexible. The present study is the first to explore the interaction dynamics of
real-time voice GenAI tutors and novice programmers, informing future
educational tool design and potentially addressing accessibility needs of
diverse learners.

\\
  The National Running Club Database (NRCD) aggregates 15,397 race results of
5,585 athletes from the 2023 and 2024 cross country seasons. This paper
introduces the NRCD dataset, which provides insights into individual athlete
progressions, enabling data-driven decision-making. Analysis reveals that
runners' improvement per calendar day for women, racing 6,000m, and men, racing
8,000m, is more pronounced in athletes with slower initial race times and those
who race more frequently. Additionally, we factor in course conditions,
including weather and elevation gain, to standardize improvement. While the
NRCD shows a gender imbalance, 3,484 men vs. 2,101 women, the racing frequency
between genders is comparable. This publication makes the NRCD dataset
accessible to the research community, addressing a previous challenge where
smaller datasets, often limited to 500 entries, had to be manually scraped from
the internet. Focusing on club athletes rather than elite professionals offers
a unique lens into the performance of real-world runners who balance
competition with academics and other commitments. These results serve as a
valuable resource for runners, coaches, and teams, bridging the gap between raw
data and applied sports science.

Title: Optimal Multimarginal Schr\"odinger Bridge: Minimum Spanning Tree over
  Measure-valued Vertices
Authors: Georgiy A. Bondar, and Abhishek Halder
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI math.OC stat.ML
\\
  The Multimarginal Schr\"odinger Bridge (MSB) finds the optimal coupling among
a collection of random vectors with known statistics and a known correlation
structure. In the MSB formulation, this correlation structure is specified
\emph{a priori} as an undirected connected graph with measure-valued vertices.
In this work, we formulate and solve the problem of finding the optimal MSB in
the sense we seek the optimal coupling over all possible graph structures. We
find that computing the optimal MSB amounts to solving the minimum spanning
tree problem over measure-valued vertices. We show that the resulting problem
can be solved in two steps. The first step constructs a complete graph with
edge weight equal to a sum of the optimal value of the corresponding bimarginal
SB and the entropies of the endpoints. The second step solves a standard
minimum spanning tree problem over that complete weighted graph. Numerical
experiments illustrate the proposed solution.

Title: Test-Time Warmup for Multimodal Large Language Models
Authors: Nikita Rajaneesh, Thomas Zollo, Richard Zemel
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced
reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully
realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder,
and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text
embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with
billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only
thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on
complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on
extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup
method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly
supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative
performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on
the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up'
before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.

\\
  Generative AI is reshaping UX design practices through "vibe coding," where
UX professionals express intent in natural language and AI translates it into
functional prototypes and code. Despite rapid adoption, little research has
examined how vibe coding reconfigures UX workflows and collaboration. Drawing
on interviews with 20 UX professionals across enterprises, startups, and
academia, we show how vibe coding follows a four-stage workflow of ideation, AI
generation, debugging, and review. This accelerates iteration, supports
creativity, and lowers barriers to participation. However, professionals
reported challenges of code unreliability, integration, and AI over-reliance.
We find tensions between efficiency-driven prototyping ("intending the right
design") and reflection ("designing the right intention"), introducing new
asymmetries in trust, responsibility, and social stigma within teams. Through
the lens of responsible human-AI collaboration for AI-assisted UX design and
development, we contribute a deeper understanding of deskilling, ownership and
disclosure, and creativity safeguarding in the age of vibe coding.

\\
  AI-driven digital ecosystems span diverse stakeholders including technology
firms, regulators, accelerators and civil society, yet often lack cohesive
ethical governance. This paper proposes a four-pillar framework (SCOR) to embed
accountability, fairness, and inclusivity across such multi-actor networks.
Leveraging a design science approach, we develop a Shared Ethical Charter(S),
structured Co-Design and Stakeholder Engagement protocols(C), a system of
Continuous Oversight and Learning(O), and Adaptive Regulatory Alignment
strategies(R). Each component includes practical guidance, from lite modules
for resource-constrained start-ups to in-depth auditing systems for larger
consortia. Through illustrative vignettes in healthcare, finance, and smart
city contexts, we demonstrate how the framework can harmonize organizational
culture, leadership incentives, and cross-jurisdictional compliance. Our
mixed-method KPI design further ensures that quantitative targets are
complemented by qualitative assessments of user trust and cultural change. By
uniting ethical principles with scalable operational structures, this paper
offers a replicable pathway toward responsible AI innovation in complex digital
ecosystems.

  For groups of autonomous agents to achieve a particular goal, they must
engage in coordination and long-horizon reasoning. However, designing reward
functions to elicit such behavior is challenging. In this paper, we study how
self-supervised goal-reaching techniques can be leveraged to enable agents to
cooperate. The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar
reward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This
problem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state
rather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal
is quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching
techniques enable agents to learn from such feedback. On MARL benchmarks, our
proposed method outperforms alternative approaches that have access to the same
sparse reward signal as our method. While our method has no explicit mechanism
for exploration, we observe that self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching
leads to emergent cooperation and exploration in settings where alternative
approaches never witness a single successful trial.

  The success and wide adoption of generative AI (GenAI), particularly large
language models (LLMs), has attracted the attention of cybercriminals seeking
to abuse models, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services. Moreover, providing
security to LLM-based systems is a great challenge, as both traditional threats
to software applications and threats targeting LLMs and their integration must
be mitigated. In this survey, we shed light on security and privacy concerns of
such LLM-based systems by performing a systematic review and comprehensive
categorization of threats and defensive strategies considering the entire
software and LLM life cycles. We analyze real-world scenarios with distinct
characteristics of LLM usage, spanning from development to operation. In
addition, threats are classified according to their severity level and to which
scenarios they pertain, facilitating the identification of the most relevant
threats. Recommended defense strategies are systematically categorized and
mapped to the corresponding life cycle phase and possible attack strategies
they attenuate. This work paves the way for consumers and vendors to understand
and efficiently mitigate risks during integration of LLMs in their respective
solutions or organizations. It also enables the research community to benefit
from the discussion of open challenges and edge cases that may hinder the
secure and privacy-preserving adoption of LLM-based systems.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Federated Learning via Explainable
  Adaptive Differential Privacy
Authors: Fardin Jalil Piran, Zhiling Chen, Yang Zhang, Qianyu Zhou, Jiong Tang,
  Farhad Imani
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
Comments: 21 pages
\\
  Decentralized federated learning faces privacy risks because model updates
can leak data through inference attacks and membership inference, a concern
that grows over many client exchanges. Differential privacy offers principled
protection by injecting calibrated noise so confidential information remains
secure on resource-limited IoT devices. Yet without transparency, black-box
training cannot track noise already injected by previous clients and rounds,
which forces worst-case additions and harms accuracy. We propose PrivateDFL, an
explainable framework that joins hyperdimensional computing with differential
privacy and keeps an auditable account of cumulative noise so each client adds
only the difference between the required noise and what has already been
accumulated. We evaluate on MNIST, ISOLET, and UCI-HAR to span image, signal,
and tabular modalities, and we benchmark against transformer-based and deep
learning-based baselines trained centrally with Differentially Private
Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) and Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP).
PrivateDFL delivers higher accuracy, lower latency, and lower energy across IID
and non-IID partitions while preserving formal (epsilon, delta) guarantees and
operating without a central server. For example, under non-IID partitions,
PrivateDFL achieves 24.42% higher accuracy than the Vision Transformer on MNIST
while using about 10x less training time, 76x lower inference latency, and 11x
less energy, and on ISOLET it exceeds Transformer accuracy by more than 80%
with roughly 10x less training time, 40x lower inference latency, and 36x less
training energy. Future work will extend the explainable accounting to
adversarial clients and adaptive topologies with heterogeneous privacy budgets.

Title: Learning Concave Bid Shading Strategies in Online Auctions via
  Measure-valued Proximal Optimization
Authors: Iman Nodozi, Djordje Gligorijevic, and Abhishek Halder
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI math.OC stat.ML
\\
  This work proposes a bid shading strategy for first-price auctions as a
measure-valued optimization problem. We consider a standard parametric form for
bid shading and formulate the problem as convex optimization over the joint
distribution of shading parameters. After each auction, the shading parameter
distribution is adapted via a regularized Wasserstein-proximal update with a
data-driven energy functional. This energy functional is conditional on the
context, i.e., on publisher/user attributes such as domain, ad slot type,
device, or location. The proposed algorithm encourages the bid distribution to
place more weight on values with higher expected surplus, i.e., where the win
probability and the value gap are both large. We show that the resulting
measure-valued convex optimization problem admits a closed form solution. A
numerical example illustrates the proposed method.

Comments: Accepted to the 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC
  2025)
\\
  Sequential fine-tuning of transformers is useful when new data arrive
sequentially, especially with shifting distributions. Unlike batch learning,
sequential learning demands that training be stabilized despite a small amount
of data by balancing new information and previously learned knowledge in the
pre-trained models. This challenge is further complicated when training is to
be completed in latency-critical environments and learning must additionally
quantify and be mediated by uncertainty. Motivated by these challenges, we
propose a novel method that frames sequential fine-tuning as a posterior
inference problem within a Bayesian framework. Our approach integrates
closed-form moment propagation of random variables, Kalman Bayesian Neural
Networks, and Taylor approximations of the moments of softmax functions. By
explicitly accounting for pre-trained models as priors and adaptively balancing
them against new information based on quantified uncertainty, our method
achieves robust and data-efficient sequential learning. The effectiveness of
our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations involving sequential
adaptation of a decision transformer to tasks characterized by distribution
shifts and limited memory resources.

  The dark patterns, deceptive interface designs manipulating user behaviors,
have been extensively studied for their effects on human decision-making and
autonomy. Yet, with the rising prominence of LLM-powered GUI agents that
automate tasks from high-level intents, understanding how dark patterns affect
agents is increasingly important. We present a two-phase empirical study
examining how agents, human participants, and human-AI teams respond to 16
types of dark patterns across diverse scenarios. Phase 1 highlights that agents
often fail to recognize dark patterns, and even when aware, prioritize task
completion over protective action. Phase 2 revealed divergent failure modes:
humans succumb due to cognitive shortcuts and habitual compliance, while agents
falter from procedural blind spots. Human oversight improved avoidance but
introduced costs such as attentional tunneling and cognitive load. Our findings
show neither humans nor agents are uniformly resilient, and collaboration
introduces new vulnerabilities, suggesting design needs for transparency,
adjustable autonomy, and oversight.

Title: HalluField: Detecting LLM Hallucinations via Field-Theoretic Modeling
Authors: Minh Vu, Brian K. Tran, Syed A. Shah, Geigh Zollicoffer, Nhat
  Hoang-Xuan, Manish Bhattarai
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning and
question-answering capabilities. However, they often produce inaccurate or
unreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly
limits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing
need for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this
work, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for
hallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and
thermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response
to a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood
token paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By
analyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under
changes in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic
stability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying
unstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is
computationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the
model's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural
networks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical
interpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics.
Remarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField
achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and
datasets.

  The rapid growth of digital and AI-generated images has amplified the need
for secure and verifiable methods of image attribution. While digital
watermarking offers more robust protection than metadata-based
approaches--which can be easily stripped--current watermarking techniques
remain vulnerable to forgery, creating risks of misattribution that can damage
the reputations of AI model developers and the rights of digital artists. These
vulnerabilities arise from two key issues: (1) content-agnostic watermarks,
which, once learned or leaked, can be transferred across images to fake
attribution, and (2) reliance on detector-based verification, which is
unreliable since detectors can be tricked. We present MetaSeal, a novel
framework for content-dependent watermarking with cryptographic security
guarantees to safeguard image attribution. Our design provides (1) forgery
resistance, preventing unauthorized replication and enforcing cryptographic
verification; (2) robust, self-contained protection, embedding attribution
directly into images while maintaining resilience against benign
transformations; and (3) evidence of tampering, making malicious alterations
visually detectable. Experiments demonstrate that MetaSeal effectively
mitigates forgery attempts and applies to both natural and AI-generated images,
establishing a new standard for secure image attribution.

Title: Contextual Budget Bandit for Food Rescue Volunteer Engagement
Authors: Ariana Tang, Naveen Raman, Fei Fang, Zheyuan Ryan Shi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY
\\
  Volunteer-based food rescue platforms tackle food waste by matching surplus
food to communities in need. These platforms face the dual problem of
maintaining volunteer engagement and maximizing the food rescued. Existing
algorithms to improve volunteer engagement exacerbate geographical disparities,
leaving some communities systematically disadvantaged. We address this issue by
proposing Contextual Budget Bandit. Contextual Budget Bandit incorporates
context-dependent budget allocation in restless multi-armed bandits, a model of
decision-making which allows for stateful arms. By doing so, we can allocate
higher budgets to communities with lower match rates, thereby alleviating
geographical disparities. To tackle this problem, we develop an empirically
fast heuristic algorithm. Because the heuristic algorithm can achieve a poor
approximation when active volunteers are scarce, we design the Mitosis
algorithm, which is guaranteed to compute the optimal budget allocation.
Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms outperform baselines on both
synthetic and real-world food rescue datasets, and show how our algorithm
achieves geographical fairness in food rescue.

Title: Bridging Cultural Distance Between Models Default and Local Classroom
  Demands: How Global Teachers Adopt GenAI to Support Everyday Teaching
  Practices
Authors: Ruiwei Xiao, Qing Xiao, Xinying Hou, Hanqi Jane Li, Phenyo Phemelo

\\
  Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering K-12 classrooms, offering teachers
new ways for teaching practices. Yet GenAI models are often trained on
culturally uneven datasets, embedding a "default culture" that often misaligns
with local classrooms. To understand how teachers navigate this gap, we defined
the new concept Cultural Distance (the gap between GenAI's default cultural
repertoire and the situated demands of teaching practice) and conducted
in-depth interviews with 30 K-12 teachers, 10 each from South Africa, Taiwan,
and the United States, who had integrated AI into their teaching practice.
These teachers' experiences informed the development of our three-level
cultural distance framework. This work contributes the concept and framework of
cultural distance, six illustrative instances spanning in low, mid, high
distance levels with teachers' experiences and strategies for addressing them.
Empirically, we offer implications to help AI designers, policymakers, and
educators create more equitable and culturally responsive GenAI tools for
education.

Title: GoldenTransformer: A Modular Fault Injection Framework for Transformer
  Robustness Research
Authors: Luke Howard
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 4 Pages
\\
  Transformers have become the foundation for a wide range of
state--of--the--art models across natural language processing, computer vision,
and other machine learning domains. Despite their widespread deployment, the
robustness of these models under fault conditions remains underexplored. We
present GoldenTransformer, a modular and extensible fault injection framework
designed to evaluate the resiliency of Large Language Models to induced
hardware faults. GoldenTransformer offers a unified Python-based platform for
injecting diverse classes of faults--such as weight corruption, activation
injections, and attention--level disruptions--into pretrained
transformer--based models. Inspired by the GoldenEye simulator for DNNs, our
framework focuses on the unique challenges of working with large transformer
architectures, including considerations such as structural complexity, latent
dependencies, and nonuniform layer definitions. GoldenTransformer is built atop
PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers, and it supports experiment
reproducibility, metric logging, and visualization out of the box. We detail
the technical design and use of GoldenTransformer and demonstrate through
several example experiments on classification and generation tasks. By enabling
controlled injection of faults at multiple logical and structural points in a
transformer, GoldenTransformer offers researchers and practitioners a valuable
tool for model robustness analysis and for guiding dependable system design in
real-world LLM applications.

  Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa (L.) Pomel) is a chlorophyll-deficient
parasitic plant that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from
the host, with reported yield losses up to 80 percent. Its mostly subterranean
life cycle and prolific seed production (more than 200,000 seeds per plant,
viable for up to 20 years) make early detection essential. We present an
end-to-end pipeline that uses Sentinel-2 imagery and time-series analysis to
identify broomrape-infested tomato fields in California. Regions of interest
were defined from farmer-reported infestations, and images with less than 10
percent cloud cover were retained. We processed 12 spectral bands and
sun-sensor geometry, computed 20 vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, NDMI), and
derived five plant traits (Leaf Area Index, Leaf Chlorophyll Content, Canopy
Chlorophyll Content, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation,
and Fractional Vegetation Cover) using a neural network calibrated with
ground-truth and synthetic data. Trends in Canopy Chlorophyll Content
delineated transplanting-to-harvest periods, and phenology was aligned using
growing degree days. Vegetation pixels were segmented and used to train a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on 18,874 pixels across 48 growing-degree-day
time points. The model achieved 88 percent training accuracy and 87 percent
test accuracy, with precision 0.86, recall 0.92, and F1 0.89. Permutation
feature importance ranked NDMI, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, FAPAR, and a
chlorophyll red-edge index as most informative, consistent with the
physiological effects of infestation. Results show the promise of
satellite-driven time-series modeling for scalable detection of parasitic
stress in tomato farms.

Title: Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders: Select-and-Project for Fairness and
  Control from Encoder Features Alone
Authors: Antonio B\u{a}rb\u{a}lau, Cristian Daniel P\u{a}duraru, Teodor Poncu,
  Alexandru Tifrea, Elena Burceanu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven valuable due to their ability to
provide interpretable and steerable representations. Current debiasing methods
based on SAEs manipulate these sparse activations presuming that feature
representations are housed within decoder weights. We challenge this
fundamental assumption and introduce an encoder-focused alternative for
representation debiasing, contributing three key findings: (i) we highlight an
unconventional SAE feature selection strategy, (ii) we propose a novel SAE
debiasing methodology that orthogonalizes input embeddings against encoder
weights, and (iii) we establish a performance-preserving mechanism during
debiasing through encoder weight interpolation. Our Selection and Projection
framework, termed S\&P TopK, surpasses conventional SAE usage in fairness
metrics by a factor of up to 3.2 and advances state-of-the-art test-time VLM
debiasing results by a factor of up to 1.8 while maintaining downstream
performance.

Title: FACTORS: Factorial Approximation for Complementary Two-factor
  Optimization with Risk-aware Scoring
Authors: Dongseok Kim, Wonjun Jeong, Gisung Oh
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 43 pages, 8 figures
\\
  We propose FACTORS, a framework that combines design of experiments with
Shapley decomposition to address performance and stability issues that are
sensitive to combinations of training factors. Our approach consistently
estimates main effects and two-factor interactions, then integrates them into a
risk-adjusted objective function that jointly accounts for uncertainty and
cost, enabling reliable selection of configurations under a fixed budget.
Effect estimation is implemented through two complementary paths: a plug-in
path based on conditional means, and a least-squares path that reconstructs
Shapley contributions from samples. These paths are designed to work
complementarily even when design density and bias levels differ. By
incorporating standardization of estimates, bias correction, and uncertainty
quantification, our procedure ensures comparability across heterogeneous factor
spaces and designs, while a lightweight search routine yields configurations
within practical time even for large factor spaces. On the theoretical side, we
provide error decompositions, sample complexity analysis, and upper bounds on
optimality gaps. On the interpretive side, we summarize main effects and
interactions in map form, highlighting adjustment priorities and safe
improvement pathways. Across diverse datasets and design conditions, our
approach improves rank preservation and optimal configuration identification,
reduces decision-making risks, and offers a tuning foundation that delivers
interpretable justification alongside stable performance gains even under
budget constraints.

Title: Large Language Models for Security Operations Centers: A Comprehensive
  Survey
Authors: Ali Habibzadeh, Farid Feyzi, and Reza Ebrahimi Atani
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of
understanding and generating human-like text, offering transformative potential
across diverse domains. The Security Operations Center (SOC), responsible for
safeguarding digital infrastructure, represents one of these domains. SOCs
serve as the frontline of defense in cybersecurity, tasked with continuous
monitoring, detection, and response to incidents. However, SOCs face persistent
challenges such as high alert volumes, limited resources, high demand for
experts with advanced knowledge, delayed response times, and difficulties in
leveraging threat intelligence effectively. In this context, LLMs can offer
promising solutions by automating log analysis, streamlining triage, improving
detection accuracy, and providing the required knowledge in less time. This
survey systematically explores the integration of generative AI and more
specifically LLMs into SOC workflow, providing a structured perspective on its
capabilities, challenges, and future directions. We believe that this survey
offers researchers and SOC managers a broad overview of the current state of
LLM integration within academic study. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first comprehensive study to examine LLM applications in SOCs in details.

Comments: 40 pages, 17 figures, 3 tables

\\
  We develop a flexible framework based on physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) for solving boundary value problems involving minimal surfaces in
curved spacetimes, with a particular emphasis on singularities and moving
boundaries. By encoding the underlying physical laws into the loss function and
designing network architectures that incorporate the singular behavior and
dynamic boundaries, our approach enables robust and accurate solutions to both
ordinary and partial differential equations with complex boundary conditions.
We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through applications to
minimal surface problems in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, including examples
relevant to the AdS/CFT correspondence (e.g. Wilson loops and gluon scattering
amplitudes) popularly used in the context of string theory in theoretical
physics. Our methods efficiently handle singularities at boundaries, and also
support both "soft" (loss-based) and "hard" (formulation-based) imposition of
boundary conditions, including cases where the position of a boundary is
promoted to a trainable parameter. The techniques developed here are not
limited to high-energy theoretical physics but are broadly applicable to
boundary value problems encountered in mathematics, engineering, and the
natural sciences, wherever singularities and moving boundaries play a critical
role.

Title: GTHNA: Local-global Graph Transformer with Memory Reconstruction for
  Holistic Node Anomaly Evaluation
Authors: Mingkang Li, Xuexiong Luo, Yue Zhang, Yaoyang Li, Fu Lin
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging
problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the
majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing
methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often
suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to
become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches
are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction
process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a
novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key
components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction
mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components
work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and
global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and
assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are
computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals,
resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly
detection across various graph domains.

  Strategies to improve the predicting performance of Message-Passing
Neural-Networks for molecular property predictions can be achieved by
simplifying how the message is passed and by using descriptors that capture
multiple aspects of molecular graphs. In this work, we designed model
architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more
complex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed
dataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that
structural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs
and feature sets.
  In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing
with an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that
excludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared
to classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that
convolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all
the datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level
outputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial
features and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are
sufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors. This
approach not only preserves predictive performance but also reduces
computational cost by over 50%, making it particularly advantageous for
high-throughput screening campaigns.

Title: ToMA: Token Merge with Attention for Image Generation with Diffusion
  Models

Comments: In proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine
  Learning (ICML 2025). Code available at https://github.com/wenboluu/ToMA
\\
  Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability
limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token
reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens
in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting,
scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when
paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To
bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf
method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three
key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular
optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an
attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3)
exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to
minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%,
respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This
work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for
transformers in diffusion.

Title: Clarifying Model Transparency: Interpretability versus Explainability in
  Deep Learning with MNIST and IMDB Examples
Authors: Mitali Raj
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, Accepted at ICICC 2026
\\
  The impressive capabilities of deep learning models are often counterbalanced
by their inherent opacity, commonly termed the "black box" problem, which
impedes their widespread acceptance in high-trust domains. In response, the
intersecting disciplines of interpretability and explainability, collectively
falling under the Explainable AI (XAI) umbrella, have become focal points of
research. Although these terms are frequently used as synonyms, they carry
distinct conceptual weights. This document offers a comparative exploration of
interpretability and explainability within the deep learning paradigm,
carefully outlining their respective definitions, objectives, prevalent
methodologies, and inherent difficulties. Through illustrative examinations of
the MNIST digit classification task and IMDB sentiment analysis, we
substantiate a key argument: interpretability generally pertains to a model's
inherent capacity for human comprehension of its operational mechanisms (global
understanding), whereas explainability is more commonly associated with
post-hoc techniques designed to illuminate the basis for a model's individual
predictions or behaviors (local explanations). For example, feature attribution
methods can reveal why a specific MNIST image is recognized as a '7', and
word-level importance can clarify an IMDB sentiment outcome. However, these
local insights do not render the complex underlying model globally transparent.
A clear grasp of this differentiation, as demonstrated by these standard
datasets, is vital for fostering dependable and sound artificial intelligence.

\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate software
generation in embedded machine learning workflows, yet their outputs often fail
silently or behave unpredictably. This article presents an empirical
investigation of failure modes in LLM-powered ML pipelines, based on an
autopilot framework that orchestrates data preprocessing, model conversion, and
on-device inference code generation. We show how prompt format, model behavior,
and structural assumptions influence both success rates and failure
characteristics, often in ways that standard validation pipelines fail to
detect. Our analysis reveals a diverse set of error-prone behaviors, including
format-induced misinterpretations and runtime-disruptive code that compiles but
breaks downstream. We derive a taxonomy of failure categories and analyze
errors across multiple LLMs, highlighting common root causes and systemic
fragilities. Though grounded in specific devices, our study reveals broader
challenges in LLM-based code generation. We conclude by discussing directions
for improving reliability and traceability in LLM-powered embedded ML systems.

Title: ViSTR-GP: Online Cyberattack Detection via Vision-to-State Tensor
  Regression and Gaussian Processes in Automated Robotic Operations
Authors: Navid Aftabi and Philip Samaha and Jin Ma and Long Cheng and Ramy
  Harik and Dan Li
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CR cs.SY eess.SY math.OC
\\
  Industrial robotic systems are central to automating smart manufacturing
operations. Connected and automated factories face growing cybersecurity risks
that can potentially cause interruptions and damages to physical operations.
Among these attacks, data-integrity attacks often involve sophisticated
exploitation of vulnerabilities that enable an attacker to access and
manipulate the operational data and are hence difficult to detect with only
existing intrusion detection or model-based detection. This paper addresses the
challenges in utilizing existing side-channels to detect data-integrity attacks
in robotic manufacturing processes by developing an online detection framework,
ViSTR-GP, that cross-checks encoder-reported measurements against a
vision-based estimate from an overhead camera outside the controller's
authority. In this framework, a one-time interactive segmentation initializes
SAM-Track to generate per-frame masks. A low-rank tensor-regression surrogate
maps each mask to measurements, while a matrix-variate Gaussian process models
nominal residuals, capturing temporal structure and cross-joint correlations. A
frame-wise test statistic derived from the predictive distribution provides an
online detector with interpretable thresholds. We validate the framework on a
real-world robotic testbed with synchronized video frame and encoder data,
collecting multiple nominal cycles and constructing replay attack scenarios
with graded end-effector deviations. Results on the testbed indicate that the
proposed framework recovers joint angles accurately and detects data-integrity
attacks earlier with more frequent alarms than all baselines. These
improvements are most evident in the most subtle attacks. These results show
that plants can detect data-integrity attacks by adding an independent physical
channel, bypassing the controller's authority, without needing complex
instrumentation.

Title: Testing for LLM response differences: the case of a composite null
  consisting of semantically irrelevant query perturbations
Authors: Aranyak Acharyya and Carey E. Priebe and Hayden S. Helm
Categories: math.ST cs.AI stat.ME stat.TH
\\
  Given an input query, generative models such as large language models produce
a random response drawn from a response distribution. Given two input queries,
it is natural to ask if their response distributions are the same. While
traditional statistical hypothesis testing is designed to address this
question, the response distribution induced by an input query is often
sensitive to semantically irrelevant perturbations to the query, so much so
that a traditional test of equality might indicate that two semantically
equivalent queries induce statistically different response distributions. As a
result, the outcome of the statistical test may not align with the user's
requirements. In this paper, we address this misalignment by incorporating into
the testing procedure consideration of a collection of semantically similar
queries. In our setting, the mapping from the collection of user-defined
semantically similar queries to the corresponding collection of response
distributions is not known a priori and must be estimated, with a fixed budget.
Although the problem we address is quite general, we focus our analysis on the
setting where the responses are binary, show that the proposed test is
asymptotically valid and consistent, and discuss important practical
considerations with respect to power and computation.

Title: The Psychogenic Machine: Simulating AI Psychosis, Delusion Reinforcement
  and Harm Enablement in Large Language Models
Authors: Joshua Au Yeung, Jacopo Dalmasso, Luca Foschini, Richard JB Dobson,
  Zeljko Kraljevic
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Background: Emerging reports of "AI psychosis" are on the rise, where
user-LLM interactions may exacerbate or induce psychosis or adverse
psychological symptoms. The sycophantic and agreeable nature of LLMs can
beneficial, it can become a vector for harm by reinforcing delusional beliefs
in vulnerable users.
  Methods: We introduce psychosis-bench, a novel benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate the psychogenicity of LLMs comprimising 16 structured,
12-turn conversational scenarios simulating the progression of delusional
themes(Erotic Delusions, Grandiose/Messianic Delusions, Referential Delusions)
and potential harms. We evaluated eight prominent LLMs for Delusion
Confirmation (DCS), Harm Enablement (HES), and Safety Intervention(SIS) across
explicit and implicit conversational contexts.
  Findings: Across 1,536 simulated conversation turns, all LLMs demonstrated
psychogenic potential, showing a strong tendency to perpetuate rather than
challenge delusions (mean DCS of 0.91 $\pm$0.88). Models frequently enabled
harmful user requests (mean HES of 0.69 $\pm$0.84) and offered safety
interventions in only roughly a third of applicable turns (mean SIS of 0.37
$\pm$0.48). 51 / 128 (39.8%) of scenarios had no safety interventions offered.
Performance was significantly worse in implicit scenarios, models were more
likely to confirm delusions and enable harm while offering fewer interventions
(p < .001). A strong correlation was found between DCS and HES (rs = .77).
Model performance varied widely, indicating that safety is not an emergent
property of scale alone.
  Conclusion: This study establishes LLM psychogenicity as a quantifiable risk
and underscores the urgent need for re-thinking how we train LLMs. We frame
this issue not merely as a technical challenge but as a public health
imperative requiring collaboration between developers, policymakers, and
healthcare professionals.

Title: PHLoRA: data-free Post-hoc Low-Rank Adapter extraction from full-rank
  checkpoint
Authors: Bhoomit Vasani, Jack FitzGerald, Anjie Fang, Sushmit Vaish
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We introduce PHLoRA (Pronounced "flora"). (Post-hoc LoRA), a simple yet
powerful method to extract low-rank adaptation adapters from full-rank
fine-tuned models without requiring access to training data or gradients. By
computing the low-rank decomposition of weight differences between a base model
and its fine-tuned counterpart, our method reconstructs adapter modules that
can be merged or dynamically routed at inference time via S-LoRA, or served in
scalable, industry settings using platforms like NVIDIA NIM. This approach
amortizes latency overhead across requests and yields substantial cost savings.
Unlike prior work that trains each adapter explicitly, our approach decouples
fine-tuning from adapter generation, allowing adapter extraction from existing
full-rank models or third-party checkpoints. Experiments on text, image, and
video benchmarks using the Amazon Nova model family demonstrate that extracted
adapters preserve high energy from the full weight delta, can be pruned safely,
and yield negligible degradation in downstream task performance when re-merged.
Overall, PHLoRA provides a practical path for making all existing full-rank
checkpoints adapter-ready, democratizing scalable inference for all models.

Title: Decoupling Search and Learning in Neural Net Training
Authors: Akshay Vegesna and Samip Dahal
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Gradient descent typically converges to a single minimum of the training loss
without mechanisms to explore alternative minima that may generalize better.
Searching for diverse minima directly in high-dimensional parameter space is
generally intractable. To address this, we propose a framework that performs
training in two distinct phases: search in a tractable representation space
(the space of intermediate activations) to find diverse representational
solutions, and gradient-based learning in parameter space by regressing to
those searched representations. Through evolutionary search, we discover
representational solutions whose fitness and diversity scale with
compute--larger populations and more generations produce better and more varied
solutions. These representations prove to be learnable: networks trained by
regressing to searched representations approach SGD's performance on MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Performance improves with search compute up to
saturation. The resulting models differ qualitatively from networks trained
with gradient descent, following different representational trajectories during
training. This work demonstrates how future training algorithms could overcome
gradient descent's exploratory limitations by decoupling search in
representation space from efficient gradient-based learning in parameter space.

Title: Factor Graph Optimization for Leak Localization in Water Distribution
  Networks
Authors: Paul Irofti and Luis Romero-Ben and Florin Stoican and Vicen\c{c} Puig
Categories: eess.SY cs.AI cs.LG cs.SY
\\
  Detecting and localizing leaks in water distribution network systems is an
important topic with direct environmental, economic, and social impact. Our
paper is the first to explore the use of factor graph optimization techniques
for leak localization in water distribution networks, enabling us to perform
sensor fusion between pressure and demand sensor readings and to estimate the
network's temporal and structural state evolution across all network nodes. The
methodology introduces specific water network factors and proposes a new
architecture composed of two factor graphs: a leak-free state estimation factor
graph and a leak localization factor graph. When a new sensor reading is
obtained, unlike Kalman and other interpolation-based methods, which estimate
only the current network state, factor graphs update both current and past
states. Results on Modena, L-TOWN and synthetic networks show that factor
graphs are much faster than nonlinear Kalman-based alternatives such as the
UKF, while also providing improvements in localization compared to
state-of-the-art estimation-localization approaches. Implementation and
benchmarks are available at https://github.com/pirofti/FGLL.

Title: Hardness, Structural Knowledge, and Opportunity: An Analytical Framework
  for Modular Performance Modeling
Authors: Omid Gheibi, Christian K\"astner, Pooyan Jamshidi
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Performance-influence models are beneficial for understanding how
configurations affect system performance, but their creation is challenging due
to the exponential growth of configuration spaces. While gray-box approaches
leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of
the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a
system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential
model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by
formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number
of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact
the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We
introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the
inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments
with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure
these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by
the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly,
we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased
modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The
impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy
(e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for
prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a
stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers,
guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling
approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.

Title: FragmentGPT: A Unified GPT Model for Fragment Growing, Linking, and
  Merging in Molecular Design
Authors: Xuefeng Liu, Songhao Jiang, Qinan Huang, Tinson Xu, Ian Foster, Mengdi

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI q-bio.BM
\\
  Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug
development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular
fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains
challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural
redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding
or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework,
we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel
chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips
the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities,
and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm
that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data
selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective
goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that
connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple
pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as
duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of
optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular
assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets
demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules
tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.

Title: An Advanced Convolutional Neural Network for Bearing Fault Diagnosis
  under Limited Data
Authors: Shengke Sun, Shuzhen Han, Ziqian Luan, Xinghao Qin, Jiao Yin, Zhanshan

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CE
\\
  In the area of bearing fault diagnosis, deep learning (DL) methods have been
widely used recently. However, due to the high cost or privacy concerns,
high-quality labeled data are scarce in real world scenarios. While few-shot
learning has shown promise in addressing data scarcity, existing methods still
face significant limitations in this domain. Traditional data augmentation
techniques often suffer from mode collapse and generate low-quality samples
that fail to capture the diversity of bearing fault patterns. Moreover,
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with local receptive fields
makes them inadequate for extracting global features from complex vibration
signals. Additionally, existing methods fail to model the intricate
relationships between limited training samples. To solve these problems, we
propose an advanced data augmentation and contrastive fourier convolution
framework (DAC-FCF) for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data. Firstly, a
novel conditional consistent latent representation and reconstruction
generative adversarial network (CCLR-GAN) is proposed to generate more diverse
data. Secondly, a contrastive learning based joint optimization mechanism is
utilized to better model the relations between the available training data.
Finally, we propose a 1D fourier convolution neural network (1D-FCNN) to
achieve a global-aware of the input data. Experiments demonstrate that DAC-FCF
achieves significant improvements, outperforming baselines by up to 32\% on
case western reserve university (CWRU) dataset and 10\% on a self-collected
test bench. Extensive ablation experiments prove the effectiveness of the
proposed components. Thus, the proposed DAC-FCF offers a promising solution for
bearing fault diagnosis under limited data.

Title: Membership Inference Attacks on Recommender System: A Survey
Authors: Jiajie He, Yuechun Gu, Keke Chen, Xintong Chen
Categories: cs.IR cs.AI cs.CR
\\
  Recommender systems (RecSys) have been widely applied to various
applications, including E-commerce, finance, healthcare, social media and have
become increasingly influential in shaping user behavior and decision-making,
highlighting their growing impact in various domains. However, recent studies
have shown that RecSys are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs),
which aim to infer whether user interaction record was used to train a target
model or not. MIAs on RecSys models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For
example, via identifying the fact that a purchase record that has been used to
train a RecSys associated with a specific user, an attacker can infer that
user's special quirks. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on
other ML tasks, e.g., classification models and natural language processing.
However, traditional MIAs are ill-suited for RecSys due to the unseen posterior
probability. Although MIAs on RecSys form a newly emerging and rapidly growing
research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this
article, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on RecSys MIAs. This survey
offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in RecSys MIAs,
exploring the design principles, challenges, attack and defense associated with
this emerging field. We provide a unified taxonomy that categorizes different
RecSys MIAs based on their characterizations and discuss their pros and cons.
Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out
several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who
wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the
research community but also provides a clear description for researchers
outside this research domain.

Title: Length-Aware Rotary Position Embedding for Text-Speech Alignment
Authors: Hyeongju Kim, Juheon Lee, Jinhyeok Yang, Jacob Morton
Categories: eess.AS cs.AI cs.CL cs.SD
Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, preprint
\\
  Many recent text-to-speech (TTS) systems are built on transformer
architectures and employ cross-attention mechanisms for text-speech alignment.
Within these systems, rotary position embedding (RoPE) is commonly used to
encode positional information in text and speech representations. In this work,
we introduce length-aware RoPE (LARoPE), a simple yet effective extension of
RoPE that improves text-speech alignment. Unlike RoPE, which relies on absolute
indices, LARoPE computes relative distances between query and key positions
using length-normalized indices. Experimental results show that LARoPE
consistently outperforms RoPE, offering faster loss convergence, more accurate
text-speech alignment, and higher overall TTS quality. Furthermore, LARoPE
demonstrates greater resilience to variations in utterance duration and
maintains stable performance in extended speech generation up to 30 seconds,
whereas RoPE suffers from notable degradation. Notably, our method achieves a
state-of-the-art word error rate on a standard zero-shot TTS benchmark.

  Transformers

Comments: 6 Pages, Accepted to present at 2025 IEEE Global Communications
  Conference (GLOBECOM), Taipei, Taiwan
\\
  Beamforming techniques are utilized in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication
to address the inherent path loss limitation, thereby establishing and
maintaining reliable connections. However, adopting standard defined
beamforming approach in highly dynamic vehicular environments often incurs high
beam training overheads and reduces the available airtime for communications,
which is mainly due to exchanging pilot signals and exhaustive beam
measurements. To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning
framework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this
framework, we first extract the features individually from the visual and GPS
coordinates sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, and subsequently
fuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best
line-of-sight links can be proactively established. To show the
generalizability of the proposed framework, we perform a comprehensive
experiment in four different vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios from real-world
multi-modal sensing and communication dataset. From the experiment, we observe
that the proposed framework achieves up to 77.58% accuracy on predicting top-15
beams correctly, outperforms single modalities, incurs roughly as low as 2.32
dB average power loss, and considerably reduces the beam searching space
overheads by 76.56% for top-15 beams with respect to standard defined approach.

Title: Application of Machine Learning for Correcting Defect-induced
  Neuromorphic Circuit Inference Errors
Authors: Vedant Sawal and Hiu Yung Wong
Categories: cs.NE cs.AI
\\
  This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to correct inference
errors caused by stuck-at faults in fully analog ReRAM-based neuromorphic
circuits. Using a Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) simulation
framework, we model and analyze six spatial defect types-circular,
circular-complement, ring, row, column, and checkerboard-across multiple layers
of a multi-array neuromorphic architecture. We demonstrate that the proposed
correction method, which employs a lightweight neural network trained on the
circuit's output voltages, can recover up to 35% (from 55% to 90%) inference
accuracy loss in defective scenarios. Our results, based on handwritten digit
recognition tasks, show that even small corrective networks can significantly
improve circuit robustness. This method offers a scalable and energy-efficient
path toward enhanced yield and reliability for neuromorphic systems in edge and
internet-of-things (IoTs) applications. In addition to correcting the specific
defect types used during training, our method also demonstrates the ability to
generalize-achieving reasonable accuracy when tested on different types of
defects not seen during training. The framework can be readily extended to
support real-time adaptive learning, enabling on-chip correction for dynamic or
aging-induced fault profiles.

Title: ENJ: Optimizing Noise with Genetic Algorithms to Jailbreak LSMs
Authors: Yibo Zhang, Liang Lin
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI
\\
  The widespread application of Large Speech Models (LSMs) has made their
security risks increasingly prominent. Traditional speech adversarial attack
methods face challenges in balancing effectiveness and stealth. This paper
proposes Evolutionary Noise Jailbreak (ENJ), which utilizes a genetic algorithm
to transform environmental noise from a passive interference into an actively
optimizable attack carrier for jailbreaking LSMs. Through operations such as
population initialization, crossover fusion, and probabilistic mutation, this
method iteratively evolves a series of audio samples that fuse malicious
instructions with background noise. These samples sound like harmless noise to
humans but can induce the model to parse and execute harmful commands.
Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream speech models show that ENJ's
attack effectiveness is significantly superior to existing baseline methods.
This research reveals the dual role of noise in speech security and provides
new critical insights for model security defense in complex acoustic
environments.

Title: Agentic Username Suggestion and Multimodal Gender Detection in Online
  Platforms: Introducing the PNGT-26K Dataset
Authors: Farbod Bijary, Mohsen Ebadpour, Amirhosein Tajbakhsh
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL cs.SI
\\
  Persian names present unique challenges for natural language processing
applications, particularly in gender detection and digital identity creation,
due to transliteration inconsistencies and cultural- specific naming patterns.
Existing tools exhibit significant performance degradation on Persian names,
while the scarcity of comprehensive datasets further compounds these
limitations. To address these challenges, the present research introduces
PNGT-26K, a comprehensive dataset of Persian names, their commonly associated
gender, and their English transliteration, consisting of approximately 26,000
tuples. As a demonstration of how this resource can be utilized, we also
introduce two frameworks, namely Open Gender Detection and Nominalist. Open
Gender Detection is a production- grade, ready-to-use framework for using
existing data from a user, such as profile photo and name, to give a
probabilistic guess about the person's gender. Nominalist, the second framework
introduced by this paper, utilizes agentic AI to help users choose a username
for their social media accounts on any platform. It can be easily integrated
into any website to provide a better user experience. The PNGT-26K dataset,
Nominalist and Open Gender Detection frameworks are publicly available on
Github.

Title: RoVerFly: Robust and Versatile Learning-based Control of Quadrotor
  Across Payload Configurations
Authors: Mintae Kim, Jiaze Cai, Koushil Sreenath
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Designing robust controllers for precise, arbitrary trajectory tracking with
quadrotors is challenging due to nonlinear dynamics and underactuation, and
becomes harder with flexible cable-suspended payloads that introduce extra
degrees of freedom and hybridness. Classical model-based methods offer
stability guarantees but require extensive tuning and often do not adapt when
the configuration changes, such as when a payload is added or removed, or when
the payload mass or cable length varies. We present RoVerFly, a unified
learning-based control framework in which a reinforcement learning (RL) policy
serves as a robust and versatile tracking controller for standard quadrotors
and for cable-suspended payload systems across a range of configurations.
Trained with task and domain randomization, the controller is resilient to
disturbances and varying dynamics. It achieves strong zero-shot generalization
across payload settings, including no payload as well as varying mass and cable
length, without controller switching or re-tuning, while retaining the
interpretability and structure of a feedback tracking controller. Code and

Title: Feature Space Topology Control via Hopkins Loss
Authors: Einari Vaaras and Manu Airaksinen
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Accepted for publication in Proc. IEEE ICTAI 2025, Athens, Greece
\\
  Feature space topology refers to the organization of samples within the
feature space. Modifying this topology can be beneficial in machine learning
applications, including dimensionality reduction, generative modeling, transfer
learning, and robustness to adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a novel
loss function, Hopkins loss, which leverages the Hopkins statistic to enforce a
desired feature space topology, which is in contrast to existing
topology-related methods that aim to preserve input feature topology. We
evaluate the effectiveness of Hopkins loss on speech, text, and image data in
two scenarios: classification and dimensionality reduction using nonlinear
bottleneck autoencoders. Our experiments show that integrating Hopkins loss
into classification or dimensionality reduction has only a small impact on
classification performance while providing the benefit of modifying feature
topology.

Title: AQUA: Attention via QUery mAgnitudes for Memory and Compute Efficient
  Inference in LLMs
Authors: Santhosh G S, Saurav Prakash, Balaraman Ravindran
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental
barrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a
critical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we
introduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile
approximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a
graceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient
offline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix
via SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project
query and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions
based on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of
AQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more
computationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in
the attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically
insignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We
further showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to
synergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to
directly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to
balance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool
for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.

Title: Harnessing Optimization Dynamics for Curvature-Informed Model Merging
Authors: Pouria Mahdavinia, Hamed Mahdavi, Niloofar Mireshghallah, and Mehrdad
  Mahdavi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Model merging is an effective post-training strategy for composing
capabilities in large language models without joint retraining. We study this
in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, where multiple capability-based SFT
checkpoints -- spanning math, code, precise instruction following, general
instruction following, and knowledge recall -- must be consolidated into a
single model. We introduce Optimization Trajectory Aware (OTA) Merging, a
curvature-aware aggregation that leverages optimizer second-moment statistics
as a diagonal curvature proxy to reweight parameter edits and mitigate
interference. Complementing OTA, we propose Fast Fisher Grafting (FFG), a
curvature-driven task-localization step that sparsifies conflicting or
low-importance edits. FFG induces extremely low-rank masks concentrated in
early attention query/key projections and token embeddings, exploiting shared
curvature across capabilities. We further develop a memory-light compression of
the second moments that preserves OTA's effect. Across diverse capability-based
SFT checkpoints, OTA+FFG improves merged-model quality over strong weight-space
baselines, reduces negative transfer, and remains robust across sparsity
levels. Analyses reveal substantial curvature overlap between checkpoints,
offering a novel lens on why simple linear merging can be effective in
practice. Ablations confirm that FFG is critical for reducing task interference
and that the compressed second moments retain the gains of the full
formulation. To facilitate reproducibility, we open-source all code, training
and evaluation scripts, visualization artifacts, and capability-specific SFT
checkpoints at https://github.com/pmahdavi/ota-merge.

Categories: cs.SD cs.AI
Comments: Accepted at the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and
  Events (DCASE) Workshop 2025
\\
  Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) faces challenges in generalizing across
recording devices, particularly when labeled data is limited. The DCASE 2024
Challenge Task 1 highlights this issue by requiring models to learn from small
labeled subsets recorded on a few devices. These models need to then generalize
to recordings from previously unseen devices under strict complexity
constraints. While techniques such as data augmentation and the use of
pre-trained models are well-established for improving model generalization,
optimizing the training strategy represents a complementary yet less-explored
path that introduces no additional architectural complexity or inference
overhead. Among various training strategies, curriculum learning offers a
promising paradigm by structuring the learning process from easier to harder
examples. In this work, we propose an entropy-guided curriculum learning
strategy to address the domain shift problem in data-efficient ASC.
Specifically, we quantify the uncertainty of device domain predictions for each
training sample by computing the Shannon entropy of the device posterior
probabilities estimated by an auxiliary domain classifier. Using entropy as a
proxy for domain invariance, the curriculum begins with high-entropy samples
and gradually incorporates low-entropy, domain-specific ones to facilitate the
learning of generalizable representations. Experimental results on multiple
DCASE 2024 ASC baselines demonstrate that our strategy effectively mitigates
domain shift, particularly under limited labeled data conditions. Our strategy
is architecture-agnostic and introduces no additional inference cost, making it
easily integrable into existing ASC baselines and offering a practical solution
to domain shift.

\\
  Deep learning (DL) compilers are core infrastructure in modern DL systems,
offering flexibility and scalability beyond vendor-specific libraries. This
work uncovers a fundamental vulnerability in their design: can an official,
unmodified compiler alter a model's semantics during compilation and introduce
hidden backdoors? We study both adversarial and natural settings. In the
adversarial case, we craft benign models where triggers have no effect
pre-compilation but become effective backdoors after compilation. Tested on six
models, three commercial compilers, and two hardware platforms, our attack
yields 100% success on triggered inputs while preserving normal accuracy and
remaining undetected by state-of-the-art detectors. The attack generalizes
across compilers, hardware, and floating-point settings. In the natural
setting, we analyze the top 100 HuggingFace models (including one with 220M+
downloads) and find natural triggers in 31 models. This shows that compilers
can introduce risks even without adversarial manipulation.
  Our results reveal an overlooked threat: unmodified DL compilers can silently
alter model semantics. To our knowledge, this is the first work to expose
inherent security risks in DL compiler design, opening a new direction for
secure and trustworthy ML.

  Altmann, Tobias Rohe and Claudia Linnhoff-Popien
Categories: quant-ph cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Quantum computing is an emerging field in computer science that has seen
considerable progress in recent years, especially in machine learning. By
harnessing the principles of quantum physics, it can surpass the limitations of
classical algorithms. However, variational quantum circuits (VQCs), which rely
on adjustable parameters, often face the barren plateau phenomenon, hindering
optimization. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) is a recent concept in
classical machine learning that has led to notable improvements in parameter
efficiency for neural networks. It states that within a large network, a
smaller, more efficient subnetwork, or ''winning ticket,'' can achieve
comparable performance, potentially circumventing plateau challenges. In this
work, we investigate whether this idea can apply to VQCs. We show that the weak
LTH holds for VQCs, revealing winning tickets that retain just 26.0\% of the
original parameters. For the strong LTH, where a pruning mask is learned
without any training, we discovered a winning ticket in a binary VQC, achieving
100\% accuracy with only 45\% of the weights. These findings indicate that LTH
may mitigate barren plateaus by reducing parameter counts while preserving
performance, thus enhancing the efficiency of VQCs in quantum machine learning
tasks.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Accepted to Expert Systems with Applications Journal, Elsevier
\\
  Federated Learning (FL) is gaining prominence in machine learning as privacy
concerns grow. This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online
store) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model
updates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby
preserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing
FL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data,
despite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to
enrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this
end, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform
collaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender
system. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item
lists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or
locally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of
sparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional
challenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and
irrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational
costs. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively
augments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the
global dataset. FedGDVE employs: (i) a pre-trained graph encoder to extract
global structural features, (ii) a local valid predictor to assess
client-specific relevance, (iii) a reinforcement-learning-based probability
estimator to filter and sample only the most pertinent global interactions.
FedGDVE improves performance by up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in FL
environments.

Title: DreamNav: A Trajectory-Based Imaginative Framework for Zero-Shot
  Vision-and-Language Navigation
Authors: Yunheng Wang, Yuetong Fang, Taowen Wang, Yixiao Feng, Yawen Tan,

\\
  Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which
links language instructions to perception and control in the real world, is a
core capability of embodied robots. Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation
models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and
action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However,
existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene
understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are
expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in
planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the
following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector
aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of
point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level
planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable
anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to
endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world
tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the
strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and
18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first
zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination
while using only egocentric inputs.

Title: Quantum Architecture Search for Solving Quantum Machine Learning Tasks
Authors: Michael K\"olle, Simon Salfer, Tobias Rohe, Philipp Altmann, Claudia
  Linnhoff-Popien
Categories: quant-ph cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to address computational
problems in ways that differ fundamentally from classical approaches. While
current quantum hardware remains error-prone and limited in scale, Variational
Quantum Circuits offer a noise-resilient framework suitable for today's
devices. The performance of these circuits strongly depends on the underlying
architecture of their parameterized quantum components. Identifying efficient,
hardware-compatible quantum circuit architectures -- known as Quantum
Architecture Search (QAS) -- is therefore essential. Manual QAS is complex and
error-prone, motivating efforts to automate it. Among various automated
strategies, Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains underexplored, particularly in
Quantum Machine Learning contexts. This work introduces RL-QAS, a framework
that applies RL to discover effective circuit architectures for classification
tasks. We evaluate RL-QAS using the Iris and binary MNIST datasets. The agent
autonomously discovers low-complexity circuit designs that achieve high test
accuracy. Our results show that RL is a viable approach for automated
architecture search in quantum machine learning. However, applying RL-QAS to
more complex tasks will require further refinement of the search strategy and
performance evaluation mechanisms.

Title: Evalet: Evaluating Large Language Models by Fragmenting Outputs into
  Functions
Authors: Tae Soo Kim, Heechan Lee, Yoonjoo Lee, Joseph Seering, Juho Kim
Categories: cs.HC cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Practitioners increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate
generative AI outputs through "LLM-as-a-Judge" approaches. However, these
methods produce holistic scores that obscure which specific elements influenced
the assessments. We propose functional fragmentation, a method that dissects
each output into key fragments and interprets the rhetoric functions that each
fragment serves relative to evaluation criteria -- surfacing the elements of
interest and revealing how they fulfill or hinder user goals. We instantiate
this approach in Evalet, an interactive system that visualizes fragment-level
functions across many outputs to support inspection, rating, and comparison of
evaluations. A user study (N=10) found that, while practitioners struggled to
validate holistic scores, our approach helped them identify 48% more evaluation
misalignments. This helped them calibrate trust in LLM evaluations and rely on
them to find more actionable issues in model outputs. Our work shifts LLM
evaluation from quantitative scores toward qualitative, fine-grained analysis
of model behavior.

Title: MEMBOT: Memory-Based Robot in Intermittent POMDP
Authors: Youzhi Liang, Eyan Noronha
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Robotic systems deployed in real-world environments often operate under con-
ditions of partial and often intermittent observability, where sensor inputs
may be noisy, occluded, or entirely unavailable due to failures or
environmental con- straints. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches
that assume full state observability are ill-equipped for such challenges. In
this work, we introduce MEMBOT, a modular memory-based architecture designed to
address intermittent partial observability in robotic control tasks. MEMBOT
decouples belief inference from policy learning through a two-phase training
process: an offline multi-task learning pretraining stage that learns a robust
task-agnostic latent belief encoder using a reconstruction losses, followed by
fine-tuning of task-specific policies using behavior cloning. The belief
encoder, implemented as a state-space model (SSM) and a LSTM, integrates
temporal sequences of observations and actions to infer latent state
representations that persist even when observations are dropped. We train and
evaluate MEMBOT on 10 robotic manipulation benchmark tasks from MetaWorld and
Robomimic under varying rates of observation dropout. Results show that MEMBOT
consistently outperforms both memoryless and naively recur- rent baselines,
maintaining up to 80% of peak performance under 50% observation availability.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of explicit belief modeling in
achieving robust, transferable, and data-efficient policies for real-world
partially observable robotic systems.

Title: TransZero: Parallel Tree Expansion in MuZero using Transformer Networks
Authors: Emil Malmsten and Wendelin B\"ohmer
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Submitted to BNAIC/BeNeLearn 2025. 15 pages, 4 figures
\\
  We present TransZero, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that
removes the sequential bottleneck in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Unlike
MuZero, which constructs its search tree step by step using a recurrent
dynamics model, TransZero employs a transformer-based network to generate
multiple latent future states simultaneously. Combined with the Mean-Variance
Constrained (MVC) evaluator that eliminates dependence on inherently sequential
visitation counts, our approach enables the parallel expansion of entire
subtrees during planning. Experiments in MiniGrid and LunarLander show that
TransZero achieves up to an eleven-fold speedup in wall-clock time compared to
MuZero while maintaining sample efficiency. These results demonstrate that
parallel tree construction can substantially accelerate model-based
reinforcement learning, bringing real-time decision-making in complex
environments closer to practice. The code is publicly available on GitHub.

Title: Beyond Autoregression: An Empirical Study of Diffusion Large Language
  Models for Code Generation
Authors: Chengze li, Yitong Zhang, Jia Li, Liyi Cai, Ge Li
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
\\
  LLMs have become the mainstream approaches to code generation. Existing LLMs
mainly employ autoregressive generation, i.e. generating code token-by-token
from left to right. However, the underlying autoregressive generation has two
limitations in code generation. First, autoregressive LLMs only generate a
token at each step, showing low efficiency in practice. Second, programming is
a non-sequential process involving back-and-forth editing, while autoregressive
LLMs only employ the left-to-right generation order. These two intrinsic
limitations hinder the further development of LLMs in code generation.
Recently, diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative. Diffusion
LLMs address the above limitations with two advances, including multi-token
prediction (i.e. generating multiple tokens at each step) and flexible
generation order (i.e. flexibly determining which positions to generate
tokens). However, there is no systematic study exploring diffusion LLMs in code
generation. To bridge the knowledge gap, we present the first empirical study
of diffusion LLMs for code generation. Our study involves 9 representative
diffusion LLMs and conduct experiments on 4 widely used benchmarks. Based on
the results, we summarize the following findings. (1) Existing diffusion LLMs
are competitive with autoregressive LLMs with similar sizes. (2) Diffusion LLMs
have a stronger length extrapolation ability than autoregressive LLMs and
perform better in long code understanding. (3) We explore factors impacting the
effectiveness and efficiency of diffusion LLMs, and provide practical guidance.
(4) We discuss several promising further directions to improve diffusion LLMs
on code generation. We open-source all source code, data, and results to
facilitate the following research. The code is publicly available at

Title: Gradient Free Deep Reinforcement Learning With TabPFN
Authors: David Schiff, Ofir Lindenbaum, Yonathan Efroni
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Gradient based optimization is fundamental to most modern deep reinforcement
learning algorithms, however, it introduces significant sensitivity to
hyperparameters, unstable training dynamics, and high computational costs. We
propose TabPFN RL, a novel gradient free deep RL framework that repurposes the
meta trained transformer TabPFN as a Q function approximator. Originally
developed for tabular classification, TabPFN is a transformer pre trained on
millions of synthetic datasets to perform inference on new unseen datasets via
in context learning. Given an in context dataset of sample label pairs and new
unlabeled data, it predicts the most likely labels in a single forward pass,
without gradient updates or task specific fine tuning. We use TabPFN to predict
Q values using inference only, thereby eliminating the need for back
propagation at both training and inference. To cope with the model's fixed
context budget, we design a high reward episode gate that retains only the top
5% of trajectories. Empirical evaluations on the Gymnasium classic control
suite demonstrate that TabPFN RL matches or surpasses Deep Q Network on
CartPole v1, MountainCar v0, and Acrobot v1, without applying gradient descent
or any extensive hyperparameter tuning. We discuss the theoretical aspects of
how bootstrapped targets and non stationary visitation distributions violate
the independence assumptions encoded in TabPFN's prior, yet the model retains a
surprising generalization capacity. We further formalize the intrinsic context
size limit of in context RL algorithms and propose principled truncation
strategies that enable continual learning when the context is full. Our results
establish prior fitted networks such as TabPFN as a viable foundation for fast
and computationally efficient RL, opening new directions for gradient free RL
with large pre trained transformers.

  With the rapid development of the new energy vehicle industry, the efficient
disassembly and recycling of power batteries have become a critical challenge
for the circular economy. In current unstructured disassembly scenarios, the
dynamic nature of the environment severely limits the robustness of robotic
perception, posing a significant barrier to autonomous disassembly in
industrial applications. This paper proposes a continual learning framework
based on Neuro-Symbolic task and motion planning (TAMP) to enhance the
adaptability of embodied intelligence systems in dynamic environments. Our
approach integrates a multimodal perception cross-validation mechanism into a
bidirectional reasoning flow: the forward working flow dynamically refines and
optimizes action strategies, while the backward learning flow autonomously
collects effective data from historical task executions to facilitate continual
system learning, enabling self-optimization. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework improves the task success rate in dynamic disassembly
scenarios from 81.68% to 100%, while reducing the average number of perception
misjudgments from 3.389 to 1.128. This research provides a new paradigm for
enhancing the robustness and adaptability of embodied intelligence in complex
industrial environments.

Title: Efficient Single-Step Framework for Incremental Class Learning in Neural
  Networks
Authors: Alejandro Dopico-Castro, Oscar Fontenla-Romero, Bertha
  Guijarro-Berdi\~nas and Amparo Alonso-Betanzos
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Incremental learning remains a critical challenge in machine learning, as
models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting -the tendency to lose
previously acquired knowledge when learning new information. These challenges
are even more pronounced in resource-limited settings. Many existing Class
Incremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually
adapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial
computational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work
introduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach
that addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable
solution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several
existing, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature
extractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer
neural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor
eliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This,
combined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to
perform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization
process on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time
without requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets
confirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the
classifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing
state-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and
sustainability. CIFNet represents a significant advancement in making
class-incremental learning more accessible and pragmatic in environments with
limited resources, especially when strong pre-trained feature extractors are
available.

Categories: cs.NI cs.AI
\\
  6th Generation (6G) mobile networks are envisioned to support several new
capabilities and data-centric applications for unprecedented number of users,
potentially raising significant energy efficiency and sustainability concerns.
This brings focus on sustainability as one of the key objectives in the their
design. To move towards sustainable solution, research and standardization
community is focusing on several key issues like energy information monitoring
and exposure, use of renewable energy, and use of Artificial
Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) for improving the energy efficiency in 6G
networks. The goal is to build energy-aware solutions that takes into account
the energy information resulting in energy efficient networks. Design of
energy-aware 6G networks brings in new challenges like increased overheads in
gathering and exposing of energy related information, and the associated user
consent management. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey
of methods used for design of energy efficient 6G networks, like energy
harvesting, energy models and parameters, classification of energy-aware
services, and AI/ML-based solutions. The survey also includes few use cases
that demonstrate the benefits of incorporating energy awareness into network
decisions. Several ongoing standardization efforts in 3GPP, ITU, and IEEE are
included to provide insights into the ongoing work and highlight the
opportunities for new contributions. We conclude this survey with open research
problems and challenges that can be explored to make energy-aware design
feasible and ensure optimality regarding performance and energy goals for 6G
networks.

  Social robots offer a promising solution for autonomously guiding patients

advanced decision-making to adapt to patient needs. A key challenge is the

their interactions with our robot to inform a patient behavior model capable of
generating exercise performance metrics and subjective scores on perceived

demonstrating that it can adapt exercise instructions to individual exertion
tolerances and fluctuating performance, while also being applicable to patients
at different recovery stages with varying exercise plans.

\\
  We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a
base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We
describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders
collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed,
penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins.
When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates,
score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility.
  Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference
Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and,
when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization,
canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses
when assumptions fail.
  We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along
with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress
tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python
reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and
adapters for DPO and RRHF.

Title: Weakly Supervised Vulnerability Localization via Multiple Instance
  Learning
Authors: Wenchao Gu, Yupan Chen, Yanlin Wang, Hongyu Zhang, Cuiyun Gao, Michael
  R. Lyu
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
\\
  Software vulnerability detection has emerged as a significant concern in the
field of software security recently, capturing the attention of numerous
researchers and developers. Most previous approaches focus on coarse-grained
vulnerability detection, such as at the function or file level. However, the
developers would still encounter the challenge of manually inspecting a large
volume of code inside the vulnerable function to identify the specific
vulnerable statements for modification, indicating the importance of
vulnerability localization. Training the model for vulnerability localization
usually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling
vulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence,
the demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at
the statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
approach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via
multiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level
labels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a
function is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the
vulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization). Specifically,
inspired by the concept of multiple instance learning, WAVES converts the
ground-truth label at the function-level into pseudo labels for individual
statements, eliminating the need for additional statement-level labeling. These
pseudo labels are utilized to train the classifiers for the function-level
representation vectors. Extensive experimentation on three popular benchmark
datasets demonstrates that, in comparison to previous baselines, our approach
achieves comparable performance in vulnerability detection and state-of-the-art
performance in statement-level vulnerability localization.

  Purpose: The governance of artificial iintelligence (AI) systems requires a
structured approach that connects high-level regulatory principles with
practical implementation. Existing frameworks lack clarity on how regulations
translate into conformity mechanisms, leading to gaps in compliance and
enforcement. This paper addresses this critical gap in AI governance.
  Methodology/Approach: A five-layer AI governance framework is proposed,
spanning from broad regulatory mandates to specific standards, assessment
methodologies, and certification processes. By narrowing its scope through
progressively focused layers, the framework provides a structured pathway to
meet technical, regulatory, and ethical requirements. Its applicability is
validated through two case studies on AI fairness and AI incident reporting.
  Findings: The case studies demonstrate the framework's ability to identify
gaps in legal mandates, standardization, and implementation. It adapts to both
global and region-specific AI governance needs, mapping regulatory mandates
with practical applications to improve compliance and risk management.
  Practical Implications - By offering a clear and actionable roadmap, this
work contributes to global AI governance by equipping policymakers, regulators,
and industry stakeholders with a model to enhance compliance and risk
management.
  Social Implications: The framework supports the development of policies that
build public trust and promote the ethical use of AI for the benefit of
society.
  Originality/Value: This study proposes a five-layer AI governance framework
that bridges high-level regulatory mandates and implementation guidelines.
Validated through case studies on AI fairness and incident reporting, it
identifies gaps such as missing standardized assessment procedures and
reporting mechanisms, providing a structured foundation for targeted governance
measures.

Title: Detecting Model Drifts in Non-Stationary Environment Using Edit

Authors: Chang-Hwan Lee and Alexander Shim

Comments: 28 pages, 3 figures, 17 tables
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically assume stationary environment
dynamics. Yet in real-world applications such as healthcare, robotics, and
finance, transition probabilities or reward functions may evolve, leading to
model drift. This paper proposes a novel framework to detect such drifts by
analyzing the distributional changes in sequences of agent behavior.
Specifically, we introduce a suite of edit operation-based measures to quantify
deviations between state-action trajectories generated under stationary and
perturbed conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that these measures can
effectively distinguish drifted from non-drifted scenarios, even under varying
levels of noise, providing a practical tool for drift detection in
non-stationary RL environments.

Authors: Seyed Kourosh Mahjour, Seyed Saman Mahjour
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CE
\\
  The petroleum industry faces unprecedented challenges in reservoir
management, requiring rapid integration of complex multimodal datasets for
real-time decision support. This study presents a novel integrated framework
combining state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet,
Gemini 2.5 Pro) with advanced prompt engineering techniques and multimodal data
fusion for comprehensive reservoir analysis. The framework implements
domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with over 50,000 petroleum
engineering documents, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot learning for
rapid field adaptation. Multimodal integration processes seismic
interpretations, well logs, and production data through specialized AI models
with vision transformers. Field validation across 15 diverse reservoir
environments demonstrates exceptional performance: 94.2% reservoir
characterization accuracy, 87.6% production forecasting precision, and 91.4%
well placement optimization success rate. The system achieves sub-second
response times while maintaining 96.2% safety reliability with no high-risk
incidents during evaluation. Economic analysis reveals 62-78% cost reductions
(mean 72%) relative to traditional methods with 8-month payback period.
Few-shot learning reduces field adaptation time by 72%, while automated prompt
optimization achieves 89% improvement in reasoning quality. The framework
processed real-time data streams with 96.2% anomaly detection accuracy and
reduced environmental incidents by 45%. We provide detailed experimental
protocols, baseline comparisons, ablation studies, and statistical significance
testing to ensure reproducibility. This research demonstrates practical
integration of cutting-edge AI technologies with petroleum domain expertise for
enhanced operational efficiency, safety, and economic performance.

  A red team simulates adversary attacks to help defenders find effective
strategies to defend their systems in a real-world operational setting. As more
enterprise systems adopt AI, red-teaming will need to evolve to address the
unique vulnerabilities and risks posed by AI systems. We take the position that
AI systems can be more effectively red-teamed if AI red-teaming is recognized
as a domain-specific evolution of cyber red-teaming. Specifically, we argue
that existing Cyber Red Teams who adopt this framing will be able to better
evaluate systems with AI components by recognizing that AI poses new risks, has
new failure modes to exploit, and often contains unpatchable bugs that
re-prioritize disclosure and mitigation strategies. Similarly, adopting a
cybersecurity framing will allow existing AI Red Teams to leverage a
well-tested structure to emulate realistic adversaries, promote mutual
accountability with formal rules of engagement, and provide a pattern to mature
the tooling necessary for repeatable, scalable engagements. In these ways, the
merging of AI and Cyber Red Teams will create a robust security ecosystem and
best position the community to adapt to the rapidly changing threat landscape.

Title: Framing AI System Benchmarking as a Learning Task: FlexBench and the
  Open MLPerf Dataset
Authors: Grigori Fursin and Daniel Altunay
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Existing AI system benchmarks such as MLPerf often struggle to keep pace with
the rapidly evolving AI landscape, making it difficult to support informed
deployment, optimization, and co-design decisions for AI systems. We suggest
that benchmarking itself can be framed as an AI task - one in which models are
continuously evaluated and optimized across diverse datasets, software, and
hardware, using key metrics such as accuracy, latency, throughput, energy
consumption, and cost. To support this perspective, we present FlexBench: a
modular extension of the MLPerf LLM inference benchmark, integrated with
HuggingFace and designed to provide relevant and actionable insights.
Benchmarking results and metadata are collected into an Open MLPerf Dataset,
which can be collaboratively curated, extended, and leveraged for predictive
modeling and feature engineering. We successfully validated the FlexBench
concept through MLPerf Inference submissions, including evaluations of DeepSeek
R1 and LLaMA 3.3 on commodity servers. The broader objective is to enable
practitioners to make cost-effective AI deployment decisions that reflect their
available resources, requirements, and constraints.

Title: Enhancing Generalization in Vision-Language-Action Models by Preserving
  Pretrained Representations

  Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models
(VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build
generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct
fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits
generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained
features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces
three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to
retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a
string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character
sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training
strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets
emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on
real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations,
generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success
compared to baselines.

  Learning

\\
  Developing professional, structured reasoning on par with human financial
analysts and traders remains a central challenge in AI for finance, where
markets demand interpretability and trust. Traditional time-series models lack
explainability, while LLMs face challenges in turning natural-language analysis
into disciplined, executable trades. Although reasoning LLMs have advanced in
step-by-step planning and verification, their application to risk-sensitive
financial decisions is underexplored. We present Trading-R1, a
financially-aware model that incorporates strategic thinking and planning for
comprehensive thesis composition, facts-grounded analysis, and
volatility-adjusted decision making. Trading-R1 aligns reasoning with trading
principles through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a
three-stage easy-to-hard curriculum. Training uses Tauric-TR1-DB, a 100k-sample
corpus spanning 18 months, 14 equities, and five heterogeneous financial data
sources. Evaluated on six major equities and ETFs, Trading-R1 demonstrates
improved risk-adjusted returns and lower drawdowns compared to both open-source
and proprietary instruction-following models as well as reasoning models. The
system generates structured, evidence-based investment theses that support
disciplined and interpretable trading decisions. Trading-R1 Terminal will be
released at https://github.com/TauricResearch/Trading-R1.

  Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech
language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic
features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human
speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from
self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from
pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the
semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies
acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal
alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary
techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and
contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and
unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision,
supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted
representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and
(iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by
dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for
fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS,
demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis.
Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech,
surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy,
perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight
the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for
speech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are

  This study presents a deep tabular learning framework for predicting crash
severity in electric vehicle (EV) collisions using real-world crash data from
Texas (2017-2023). After filtering for electric-only vehicles, 23,301
EV-involved crash records were analyzed. Feature importance techniques using
XGBoost and Random Forest identified intersection relation, first harmful
event, person age, crash speed limit, and day of week as the top predictors,
along with advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking. To
address class imbalance, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Edited
Nearest Neighbors (SMOTEENN) resampling was applied. Three state-of-the-art
deep tabular models, TabPFN, MambaNet, and MambaAttention, were benchmarked for
severity prediction. While TabPFN demonstrated strong generalization,
MambaAttention achieved superior performance in classifying severe injury cases
due to its attention-based feature reweighting. The findings highlight the
potential of deep tabular architectures for improving crash severity prediction
and enabling data-driven safety interventions in EV crash contexts.

Title: CareerPooler: AI-Powered Metaphorical Pool Simulation Improves
  Experience and Outcomes in Career Exploration
Authors: Ziyi Wang, Ziwen Zeng, Yuan Li and Zijian Ding

ACM-class: H.5
\\
  Career exploration is uncertain, requiring decisions with limited information
and unpredictable outcomes. While generative AI offers new opportunities for
career guidance, most systems rely on linear chat interfaces that produce
overly comprehensive and idealized suggestions, overlooking the non-linear and
effortful nature of real-world trajectories. We present CareerPooler, a
generative AI-powered system that employs a pool-table metaphor to simulate
career development as a spatial and narrative interaction. Users strike balls
representing milestones, skills, and random events, where hints, collisions,
and rebounds embody decision-making under uncertainty. In a within-subjects
study with 24 participants, CareerPooler significantly improved engagement,
information gain, satisfaction, and career clarity compared to a chatbot
baseline. Qualitative findings show that spatial-narrative interaction fosters
experience-based learning, resilience through setbacks, and reduced
psychological burden. Our findings contribute to the design of AI-assisted
career exploration systems and more broadly suggest that visually grounded
analogical interactions can make generative systems engaging and satisfying.

\\
  Early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is
critical for timely intervention, yet most diagnoses are delayed until advanced
stages. While comprehensive patient narratives are essential for accurate
diagnosis, prior work has largely focused on screening studies that classify
cognitive status from interactions rather than supporting the diagnostic
process. We designed voice-interactive conversational agents, leveraging large
language models (LLMs), to elicit narratives relevant to ADRD from patients and
informants. We evaluated the agent with 30 adults with suspected ADRD through
conversation analysis (n=30), user surveys (n=19), and clinical validation
against blinded specialist interviews (n=24). Symptoms detected by the agent
aligned well with those identified by specialists across symptoms. Users
appreciated the agent's patience and systematic questioning, which supported
engagement and expression of complex, hard-to-describe experiences. This
preliminary work suggests conversational agents may serve as structured
front-end tools for dementia assessment, highlighting interaction design
considerations in sensitive healthcare contexts.

Title: RAPTOR: A Foundation Policy for Quadrotor Control
Authors: Jonas Eschmann, Dario Albani, Giuseppe Loianno
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Humans are remarkably data-efficient when adapting to new unseen conditions,
like driving a new car. In contrast, modern robotic control systems, like
neural network policies trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), are highly
specialized for single environments. Because of this overfitting, they are
known to break down even under small differences like the Simulation-to-Reality
(Sim2Real) gap and require system identification and retraining for even
minimal changes to the system. In this work, we present RAPTOR, a method for
training a highly adaptive foundation policy for quadrotor control. Our method
enables training a single, end-to-end neural-network policy to control a wide
variety of quadrotors. We test 10 different real quadrotors from 32 g to 2.4 kg
that also differ in motor type (brushed vs. brushless), frame type (soft vs.
rigid), propeller type (2/3/4-blade), and flight controller
(PX4/Betaflight/Crazyflie/M5StampFly). We find that a tiny, three-layer policy
with only 2084 parameters is sufficient for zero-shot adaptation to a wide
variety of platforms. The adaptation through In-Context Learning is made
possible by using a recurrence in the hidden layer. The policy is trained
through a novel Meta-Imitation Learning algorithm, where we sample 1000
quadrotors and train a teacher policy for each of them using Reinforcement
Learning. Subsequently, the 1000 teachers are distilled into a single, adaptive
student policy. We find that within milliseconds, the resulting foundation
policy adapts zero-shot to unseen quadrotors. We extensively test the
capabilities of the foundation policy under numerous conditions (trajectory
tracking, indoor/outdoor, wind disturbance, poking, different propellers).

Title: Know What You Don't Know: Selective Prediction for Early Exit DNNs
Authors: Divya Jyoti Bajpai and Manjesh Kumar Hanawal
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: To appear in the the Fifth International Conference on AI ML Systems
\\
  Inference latency and trustworthiness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the
bottlenecks in deploying them in critical applications like sensitive tasks.
Early Exit (EE) DNNs overcome the latency issues by allowing samples to exit
from intermediary layers if they attain `high' confidence scores on the
predicted class. However, the DNNs are known to exhibit overconfidence, which
can lead to many samples exiting early and render EE strategies untrustworthy.
We use Selective Prediction (SP) to overcome this issue by checking the
`hardness' of the samples rather than just relying on the confidence score
alone. We propose SPEED, a novel approach that uses Deferral Classifiers (DCs)
at each layer to check the hardness of samples before performing EEs.
Specifically, the DCs identify if a sample is hard to predict at an
intermediary layer, leading to hallucination, and defer it to an expert. Early
detection of hard samples for inference prevents the wastage of computational
resources and improves trust by deferring the hard samples to the expert. We
demonstrate that EE aided with SP improves both accuracy and latency. Our
method minimizes the risk of wrong prediction by $50\%$ with a speedup of
$2.05\times$ as compared to the final layer. The anonymized source code is
available at https://github.com/Div290/SPEED

\\
  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress
in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement
learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL
enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with
multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online
RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from
sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present
Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL
on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original
model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively
recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture
long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns
into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level
and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance
(SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a
practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that
ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four
dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on
AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging
the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

Title: Dstack: A Zero Trust Framework for Confidential Containers
Authors: Shunfan Zhou, Kevin Wang, Hang Yin
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Web3 applications require execution platforms that maintain confidentiality
and integrity without relying on centralized trust authorities. While Trusted
Execution Environments (TEEs) offer promising capabilities for confidential
computing, current implementations face significant limitations when applied to
Web3 contexts, particularly in security reliability, censorship resistance, and
vendor independence.
  This paper presents dstack, a comprehensive framework that transforms raw TEE
technology into a true Zero Trust platform. We introduce three key innovations:
(1) Portable Confidential Containers that enable seamless workload migration
across heterogeneous TEE environments while maintaining security guarantees,
(2) Decentralized Code Management that leverages smart contracts for
transparent governance of TEE applications, and (3) Verifiable Domain
Management that ensures secure and verifiable application identity without
centralized authorities.
  These innovations are implemented through three core components: dstack-OS,
dstack-KMS, and dstack-Gateway. Together, they demonstrate how to achieve both
the performance advantages of VM-level TEE solutions and the trustless
guarantees required by Web3 applications. Our evaluation shows that dstack
provides comprehensive security guarantees while maintaining practical
usability for real-world applications.

  Learning

Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
Comments: Jizhuo Chen and Diwen Liu contributed equally
\\
  GBPP is a fast learning based scorer that selects a robot base pose for
grasping from a single RGB-D snapshot. The method uses a two stage curriculum:
(1) a simple distance-visibility rule auto-labels a large dataset at low cost;
and (2) a smaller set of high fidelity simulation trials refines the model to
match true grasp outcomes. A PointNet++ style point cloud encoder with an MLP
scores dense grids of candidate poses, enabling rapid online selection without
full task-and-motion optimization. In simulation and on a real mobile
manipulator, GBPP outperforms proximity and geometry only baselines, choosing
safer and more reachable stances and degrading gracefully when wrong. The
results offer a practical recipe for data efficient, geometry aware base
placement: use inexpensive heuristics for coverage, then calibrate with
targeted simulation.

Title: Dynamic Adaptive Parsing of Temporal and Cross-Variable Patterns for
  Network State Classification
Authors: Yuan Gao, Xuelong Wang, Zhenguo Dong and Yong Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Effective network state classification is a primary task for ensuring network
security and optimizing performance. Existing deep learning models have shown
considerable progress in this area. Some methods excel at analyzing the complex
temporal periodicities found in traffic data, while graph-based approaches are
adept at modeling the dynamic dependencies between different variables.
However, a key trade-off remains, as these methods struggle to capture both
characteristics simultaneously. Models focused on temporal patterns often
overlook crucial variable dependencies, whereas those centered on dependencies
may fail to capture fine-grained temporal details. To address this trade-off,
we introduce DAPNet, a framework based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture.
DAPNet integrates three specialized networks for periodic analysis, dynamic
cross-variable correlation modeling, and hybrid temporal feature extraction. A
learnable gating network dynamically assigns weights to experts based on the
input sample and computes a weighted fusion of their outputs. Furthermore, a
hybrid regularization loss function ensures stable training and addresses the
common issue of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on two large-scale
network intrusion detection datasets (CICIDS2017/2018) validate DAPNet's higher
accuracy for its target application. The generalizability of the architectural
design is evaluated across ten public UEA benchmark datasets, positioning
DAPNet as a specialized framework for network state classification.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR
\\
  Unlearning is the predominant method for removing the influence of data in
machine learning models. However, even after unlearning, models often continue
to produce the same predictions on the unlearned data with high confidence.
This persistent behavior can be exploited by adversaries using confident model
predictions on incorrect or obsolete data to harm users. We call this threat
model, which unlearning fails to protect against, *test-time privacy*. In
particular, an adversary with full model access can bypass any naive defenses
which ensure test-time privacy. To address this threat, we introduce an
algorithm which perturbs model weights to induce maximal uncertainty on
protected instances while preserving accuracy on the rest of the instances. Our
core algorithm is based on finetuning with a Pareto optimal objective that
explicitly balances test-time privacy against utility. We also provide a
certifiable approximation algorithm which achieves $(\varepsilon, \delta)$
guarantees without convexity assumptions. We then prove a tight, non-vacuous
bound that characterizes the privacy-utility tradeoff that our algorithms
incur. Empirically, our method obtains $>3\times$ stronger uncertainty than
pretraining with $<0.2\%$ drops in accuracy on various image recognition
benchmarks. Altogether, this framework provides a tool to guarantee additional
protection to end users.

  Enterprise APIs as Tools
Authors: Prerna Agarwal, Himanshu Gupta, Soujanya Soni, Rohith Vallam, Renuka

Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
\\
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) has lead to the
development of agents capable of complex reasoning and interaction with
external tools. In enterprise contexts, the effective use of such tools that
are often enabled by application programming interfaces (APIs), is hindered by
poor documentation, complex input or output schema, and large number of
operations. These challenges make tool selection difficult and reduce the
accuracy of payload formation by up to 25%. We propose ACE, an automated tool
creation and enrichment framework that transforms enterprise APIs into
LLM-compatible tools. ACE, (i) generates enriched tool specifications with
parameter descriptions and examples to improve selection and invocation
accuracy, and (ii) incorporates a dynamic shortlisting mechanism that filters
relevant tools at runtime, reducing prompt complexity while maintaining
scalability. We validate our framework on both proprietary and open-source APIs
and demonstrate its integration with agentic frameworks. To the best of our
knowledge, ACE is the first end-to-end framework that automates the creation,
enrichment, and dynamic selection of enterprise API tools for LLM agents.

\\
  Diffusion models have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis,
yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications.
These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies
preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes
required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding
in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify'
acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's
core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models,
predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully
computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free
verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability,
enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while
incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces
sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources
based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler
samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances.
Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality
degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation
fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The
verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference
costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference
while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.

Title: Reasoned Safety Alignment: Ensuring Jailbreak Defense via
  Answer-Then-Check
Authors: Chentao Cao, Xiaojun Xu, Bo Han, Hang Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, ensuring
their safety against jailbreak attacks remains a critical challenge. In this
paper, we introduce a novel safety alignment approach called Answer-Then-Check,
which enhances LLM robustness against malicious prompts by applying thinking
ability to mitigate jailbreaking problems before producing a final answer to
the user. Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their
thought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to
provide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety
Alignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason
through direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety
capability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks.
Notably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning
capabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. Besides, our
method equips models with the ability to perform safe completion. Unlike
post-hoc methods that can only reject harmful queries, our model can provide
helpful and safe alternative responses for sensitive topics (e.g., self-harm).
Furthermore, we discover that training on a small subset of just 500 examples
can achieve comparable performance to using the full dataset, suggesting that
safety alignment may require less data than previously assumed.

data bias in KB, including label flipping noise and class imbalance. The TALSC
framework incorporates a sample confidence module (SCM) as meta-learner and the
semantic coding networks as learners. The learners are updated based on the
empirical knowledge provided by the learnable weighted-KB (LW-KB). Meanwhile,
the meta-learner evaluates the significance of samples according to the task
loss feedback, and adjusts the update strategy of learners to enhance the
robustness in semantic recovery for unknown tasks. To strike a balance between
SCM parameters and precision of significance evaluation, we design an SCM-grid
extension (SCM-GE) approach by embedding the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN)
within SCM, which leverages the concept of spline refinement in KAN and enables
scalable SCM with customizable granularity without retraining. Simulations
demonstrate that the TALSC framework effectively mitigates the effects of
flipping noise and class imbalance in task-agnostic image semantic
communication, achieving at least 12% higher semantic recovery accuracy (SRA)
and multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Title: ParaEQsA: Parallel and Asynchronous Embodied Questions Scheduling and
  Answering
Authors: Haisheng Wang, Weiming Zhi
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures, 2026 IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation
  (ICRA 2026)
\\
  This paper formulates the Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) problem,
introduces a corresponding benchmark, and proposes a system to tackle the
problem. Classical Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is typically formulated as
answering one single question by actively exploring a 3D environment. Real
deployments, however, often demand handling multiple questions that may arrive
asynchronously and carry different urgencies. We formalize this setting as
Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) and present ParaEQsA, a framework for
parallel, urgency-aware scheduling and answering. ParaEQsA leverages a group
memory module shared among questions to reduce redundant exploration, and a
priority-planning module to dynamically schedule questions. To evaluate this
setting, we contribute the Parallel Asynchronous Embodied Questions (PAEQs)
benchmark containing 40 indoor scenes and five questions per scene (200 in
total), featuring asynchronous follow-up questions and urgency labels. We
further propose metrics for EQsA performance: Direct Answer Rate (DAR), and
Normalized Urgency-Weighted Latency (NUWL), which jointly measure efficiency
and responsiveness of this system. ParaEQsA consistently outperforms strong
sequential baselines adapted from recent EQA systems, while reducing
exploration and delay. Empirical evaluations investigate the relative
contributions of priority, urgency modeling, spatial scope, reward estimation,
and dependency reasoning within our framework. Together, these results
demonstrate that urgency-aware, parallel scheduling is key to making embodied
agents responsive and efficient under realistic, multi-question workloads.

Title: Do Code Semantics Help? A Comprehensive Study on Execution Trace-Based
  Information for Code Large Language Models
Authors: Jian Wang, Xiaofei Xie, Qiang Hu, Shangqing Liu, Yi Li
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
Comments: EMNLP2025-findings
\\
  Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming
with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed
critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and
understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant
challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code
LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning
about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs
actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented
representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across
existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason
effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic
approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these
issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic
information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct
a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing
the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on
investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting
supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The
experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate
that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling
of Code LLM.

Title: Collapse of Irrelevant Representations (CIR) Ensures Robust and
  Non-Disruptive LLM Unlearning
Authors: Filip Sondej, Yushi Yang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Current unlearning techniques and safety training consistently fail to remove
dangerous knowledge from language models. We analyze the root causes and
propose a highly selective technique which unlearns robustly and without
disrupting general performance.
  We perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify
subspaces containing common representations, and collapse them before
calculating unlearning updates. This way we avoid unlearning general
representations, and only target those specific to the unlearned facts.
  When unlearning WMDP dataset facts from Llama-3.1-8B, we drop post-attack
accuracy 80x more than our best baseline (Circuit Breakers) on biohazardous
facts and 30x more on cyberhazardous facts. Despite this, we disrupt general
performance 30x less (only 0.1% WikiText loss increase), while requiring less
than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.

  Online AI platforms for creating music from text prompts (AI music), such as
Suno and Udio, are now being used by hundreds of thousands of users. Some AI
music is appearing in advertising, and even charting, in multiple countries.
How are these platforms being used? What subjects are inspiring their users?
This article answers these questions for Suno and Udio using a large collection
of songs generated by users of these platforms from May to October 2024. Using
a combination of state-of-the-art text embedding models, dimensionality
reduction and clustering methods, we analyze the prompts, tags and lyrics, and
automatically annotate and display the processed data in interactive plots. Our
results reveal prominent themes in lyrics, language preference, prompting
strategies, as well as peculiar attempts at steering models through the use of
metatags. To promote the musicological study of the developing cultural
practice of AI-generated music we share our code and resources.

  Transformer

Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Scaling Transformer policies and diffusion models has advanced robotic
manipulation, yet combining these techniques in lightweight, cross-embodiment
learning settings remains challenging. We study design choices that most affect
stability and performance for diffusion-transformer policies trained on
heterogeneous, multimodal robot data, and introduce Tenma, a lightweight
diffusion-transformer for bi-manual arm control. Tenma integrates multiview
RGB, proprioception, and language via a cross-embodiment normalizer that maps
disparate state/action spaces into a shared latent space; a Joint State-Time
encoder for temporally aligned observation learning with inference speed
boosts; and a diffusion action decoder optimized for training stability and
learning capacity. Across benchmarks and under matched compute, Tenma achieves
an average success rate of 88.95% in-distribution and maintains strong
performance under object and scene shifts, substantially exceeding baseline
policies whose best in-distribution average is 18.12%. Despite using moderate
data scale, Tenma delivers robust manipulation and generalization, indicating
the great potential for multimodal and cross-embodiment learning strategies for
further augmenting the capacity of transformer-based imitation learning
policies.

Title: VisDocSketcher: Towards Scalable Visual Documentation with Agentic
  Systems
Authors: Lu\'is F. Gomes, Xin Zhou, David Lo, Rui Abreu
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.HC
\\
  Visual documentation is an effective tool for reducing the cognitive barrier
developers face when understanding unfamiliar code, enabling more intuitive
comprehension. Compared to textual documentation, it provides a higher-level
understanding of the system structure and data flow. Developers usually prefer
visual representations over lengthy textual descriptions for large software
systems. Visual documentation is both difficult to produce and challenging to
evaluate. Manually creating it is time-consuming, and currently, no existing
approach can automatically generate high-level visual documentation directly
from code. Its evaluation is often subjective, making it difficult to
standardize and automate. To address these challenges, this paper presents the
first exploration of using agentic LLM systems to automatically generate visual
documentation. We introduce VisDocSketcher, the first agent-based approach that
combines static analysis with LLM agents to identify key elements in the code
and produce corresponding visual representations. We propose a novel evaluation
framework, AutoSketchEval, for assessing the quality of generated visual
documentation using code-level metrics. The experimental results show that our
approach can valid visual documentation for 74.4% of the samples. It shows an
improvement of 26.7-39.8% over a simple template-based baseline. Our evaluation
framework can reliably distinguish high-quality (code-aligned) visual
documentation from low-quality (non-aligned) ones, achieving an AUC exceeding
0.87. Our work lays the foundation for future research on automated visual
documentation by introducing practical tools that not only generate valid
visual representations but also reliably assess their quality.

  Testing: A Multi-Robot Patrol Case Study
Authors: James C. Ward, Alex Bott, Connor York, and Edmund R. Hunt
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CR
\\
  Simulating hostile attacks of physical autonomous systems can be a useful
tool to examine their robustness to attack and inform vulnerability-aware
design. In this work, we examine this through the lens of multi-robot patrol,
by presenting a machine learning-based adversary model that observes robot
patrol behavior in order to attempt to gain undetected access to a secure
environment within a limited time duration. Such a model allows for evaluation
of a patrol system against a realistic potential adversary, offering insight
into future patrol strategy design. We show that our new model outperforms
existing baselines, thus providing a more stringent test, and examine its
performance against multiple leading decentralized multi-robot patrol
strategies.

Title: Poison to Detect: Detection of Targeted Overfitting in Federated
  Learning
Authors: Soumia Zohra El Mestari, Maciej Krzysztof Zuziak and Gabriele Lenzini
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralised clients while keeping local data private, making it a widely
adopted privacy-enhancing technology (PET). Despite its privacy benefits, FL
remains vulnerable to privacy attacks, including those targeting specific
clients. In this paper, we study an underexplored threat where a dishonest
orchestrator intentionally manipulates the aggregation process to induce
targeted overfitting in the local models of specific clients. Whereas many
studies in this area predominantly focus on reducing the amount of information
leakage during training, we focus on enabling an early client-side detection of
targeted overfitting, thereby allowing clients to disengage before significant
harm occurs. In line with this, we propose three detection techniques - (a)
label flipping, (b) backdoor trigger injection, and (c) model fingerprinting -
that enable clients to verify the integrity of the global aggregation. We
evaluated our methods on multiple datasets under different attack scenarios.
Our results show that the three methods reliably detect targeted overfitting
induced by the orchestrator, but they differ in terms of computational
complexity, detection latency, and false-positive rates.

Title: Generalizing Behavior via Inverse Reinforcement Learning with
  Closed-Form Reward Centroids
Authors: Filippo Lazzati, Alberto Maria Metelli
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We study the problem of generalizing an expert agent's behavior, provided
through demonstrations, to new environments and/or additional constraints.
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) offers a promising solution by seeking to
recover the expert's underlying reward function, which, if used for planning in
the new settings, would reproduce the desired behavior. However, IRL is
inherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible
set, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce
different policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional
information, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy.
In this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the
"average" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset
of the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by
planning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a
closed-form expression. We then present a provably efficient algorithm for
estimating this centroid using an offline dataset of expert demonstrations
only. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations that illustrate the
relationship between the expert's behavior and the behavior produced by our
method.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP 2025 Main Conference, Long Paper (Oral)
\\
  To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is essential
to identify the best-performing model under strict memory constraints. We
present AMQ, Automated Mixed-Precision Weight-Only Quantization, a framework
that assigns layer-wise quantization bit-widths to optimally balance model
quality and memory usage. However, the combinatorial search space, with over
10^{100} possible configurations, makes conventional black-box optimization
infeasible. AMQ overcomes this challenge through four key innovations:(1)
search space pruning using prior knowledge to exclude unpromising
configurations, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions
during search, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4)
iterative search-and-update strategy for fast and stable convergence. By
integrating these components, AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency
landscape, reaching the Pareto frontier and yielding LLMs that are both compact
and high-performing. Our code is available at https://github.com/dlwns147/amq.

Title: Imitation Learning as Return Distribution Matching
Authors: Filippo Lazzati, Alberto Maria Metelli
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We study the problem of training a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL)
agent through imitation learning (IL). Unlike standard IL, our goal is not only
to train an agent that matches the expert's expected return (i.e., its average
performance) but also its risk attitude (i.e., other features of the return
distribution, such as variance). We propose a general formulation of the
risk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's
return distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting
and assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited
expressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and
sufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it.
Building on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC
and RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and
known, respectively. We show that RS-KT achieves substantially lower sample
complexity than RS-BC by exploiting dynamics information. We further
demonstrate the sample efficiency of return distribution matching in the
setting where the expert's reward is unknown by designing an oracle-based
variant of RS-KT. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis of RS-KT and
RS-BC with numerical simulations, highlighting both their sample efficiency and
the advantages of non-Markovian policies over standard sample-efficient IL
algorithms.

  Although browser-using agents (BUAs) show promise for web tasks and
automation, most BUAs terminate after executing a single instruction, failing
to support users' complex, nonlinear browsing with ambiguous goals, iterative
decision-making, and changing contexts. We present a human-in-the-loop (HITL)
conceptual framework informed by theories of human web browsing behavior. The
framework centers on an iterative loop in which the BUA proactively proposes
next actions and the user steers the browsing process through feedback. It also
distinguishes between exploration and exploitation actions, enabling users to
control the breadth and depth of their browsing. Consequently, the framework
aims to reduce users' physical and cognitive effort while preserving users'
traditional browsing mental model and supporting users in achieving
satisfactory outcomes. We illustrate how the framework operates with
hypothetical use cases and discuss the shift from manual browsing to
interaction-driven browsing. We contribute a theoretically informed conceptual
framework for BUAs.

  Applications
Authors: Yujun Lin, Zhekai Zhang, Song Han

DOI: 10.1109/HPCA61900.2025.00101
\\
  Modern tensor applications, especially foundation models and generative AI
applications require multiple input modalities (both vision and language),
which increases the demand for flexible accelerator architecture. Existing
frameworks suffer from the trade-off between design flexibility and
productivity of RTL generation: either limited to very few hand-written
templates or cannot automatically generate the RTL. To address this challenge,
we propose the LEGO framework, which targets tensor applications and
automatically generates spatial architecture design and outputs synthesizable
RTL code without handwritten RTL design templates. Leveraging the
affine-transformation-based architecture representation, LEGO front end finds
interconnections between function units, synthesizes the memory system, and
fuses different spatial dataflow designs based on data reuse analysis. LEGO
back end then translates the hardware in a primitive-level graph to perform
lower-level optimizations, and applies a set of linear-programming algorithms
to optimally insert pipeline registers and reduce the overhead of unused logic
when switching spatial dataflows. Our evaluation demonstrates that LEGO can
achieve 3.2x speedup and 2.4x energy efficiency compared to previous work
Gemmini, and can generate one architecture for diverse modern foundation models
in generative AI applications.

  Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic
weed that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host. We
investigate early detection using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm)
and ensemble machine learning. In a field experiment in Woodland, California,
we tracked 300 tomato plants across growth stages defined by growing degree
days (GDD). Leaf reflectance was acquired with a portable spectrometer and
preprocessed (band denoising, 1 nm interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing,
correlation-based band reduction). Clear class differences were observed near
1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features, consistent with reduced leaf
water content in infected plants at early stages. An ensemble combining Random
Forest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes achieved 89% accuracy at
585 GDD, with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected). Accuracy
declined at later stages (e.g., 69% at 1568 GDD), likely due to senescence and
weed interference. Despite the small number of infected plants and
environmental confounders, results show that proximal sensing with ensemble
learning enables timely detection of broomrape before canopy symptoms are
visible, supporting targeted interventions and reduced yield losses.

Title: A Time-Series Foundation Model by Universal Delay Embedding
Authors: Zijian Wang, Peng Tao, Jifan Shi, Rui Bao, Rui Liu, Luonan Chen
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  This study introduces Universal Delay Embedding (UDE), a pretrained
foundation model designed to revolutionize time-series forecasting through
principled integration of delay embedding representation and Koopman operator
prediction. Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical
representation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches
from Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological
properties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images,
which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning
technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for
learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of
nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear
manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and
real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean
squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior
generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical
representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit
exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically
informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics,
establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal
time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial
applicability.

Title: Deceptive Risk Minimization: Out-of-Distribution Generalization by
  Deceiving Distribution Shift Detectors
Authors: Anirudha Majumdar
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO
\\
  This paper proposes deception as a mechanism for out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization: by learning data representations that make training data appear
independent and identically distributed (iid) to an observer, we can identify
stable features that eliminate spurious correlations and generalize to unseen
domains. We refer to this principle as deceptive risk minimization (DRM) and
instantiate it with a practical differentiable objective that simultaneously
learns features that eliminate distribution shifts from the perspective of a
detector based on conformal martingales while minimizing a task-specific loss.
In contrast to domain adaptation or prior invariant representation learning
methods, DRM does not require access to test data or a partitioning of training
data into a finite number of data-generating domains. We demonstrate the
efficacy of DRM on numerical experiments with concept shift and a simulated
imitation learning setting with covariate shift in environments that a robot is
deployed in.

therapist-written responses to those generated by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama
for real patient questions. Text analysis showed that LLMs produced longer,
more readable, and lexically richer responses with a more positive tone, while
therapist responses were more often written in the first person. In a survey
with 150 users and 23 licensed therapists, participants rated LLM responses as
clearer, more respectful, and more supportive than therapist-written answers.
Yet, both groups of participants expressed a stronger preference for human
therapist support. These findings highlight the promise and limitations of LLMs
in mental health, underscoring the need for designs that balance their
communicative strengths with concerns of trust, privacy, and accountability.

Title: Exploring Conversational Design Choices in LLMs for Pedagogical
  Purposes: Socratic and Narrative Approaches for Improving Instructor's
  Teaching Practice

\\
  Large language models (LLMs) typically generate direct answers, yet they are
increasingly used as learning tools. Studying instructors' usage is critical,
given their role in teaching and guiding AI adoption in education. We designed
and evaluated TeaPT, an LLM for pedagogical purposes that supports instructors'
professional development through two conversational approaches: a Socratic
approach that uses guided questioning to foster reflection, and a Narrative
approach that offers elaborated suggestions to extend externalized cognition.
In a mixed-method study with 41 higher-education instructors, the Socratic
version elicited greater engagement, while the Narrative version was preferred
for actionable guidance. Subgroup analyses further revealed that
less-experienced, AI-optimistic instructors favored the Socratic version,
whereas more-experienced, AI-cautious instructors preferred the Narrative
version. We contribute design implications for LLMs for pedagogical purposes,
showing how adaptive conversational approaches can support instructors with
varied profiles while highlighting how AI attitudes and experience shape
interaction and learning.

Title: $K$-Level Policy Gradients for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Aryaman Reddi, Gabriele Tiboni, Jan Peters, Carlo D'Eramo
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Actor-critic algorithms for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
typically employ a policy update that responds to the current strategies of
other agents. While being straightforward, this approach does not account for
the updates of other agents at the same update step, resulting in
miscoordination. In this paper, we introduce the $K$-Level Policy Gradient
(KPG), a method that recursively updates each agent against the updated
policies of other agents, speeding up the discovery of effective coordinated
policies. We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves
monotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We
provide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL
algorithms MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC. Empirically, we demonstrate superior
performance over existing deep MARL algorithms in StarCraft II and multi-agent
MuJoCo.

Title: Control Analysis and Design for Autonomous Vehicles Subject to Imperfect
  AI-Based Perception
Authors: Tao Yan, Zheyu Zhang, Jingjing Jiang, and Wen-Hua Chen
Categories: eess.SY cs.AI cs.SY
\\
  Safety is a critical concern in autonomous vehicle (AV) systems, especially
when AI-based sensing and perception modules are involved. However, due to the
black box nature of AI algorithms, it makes closed-loop analysis and synthesis
particularly challenging, for example, establishing closed-loop stability and
ensuring performance, while they are fundamental to AV safety. To approach this
difficulty, this paper aims to develop new modeling, analysis, and synthesis
tools for AI-based AVs. Inspired by recent developments in perception error
models (PEMs), the focus is shifted from directly modeling AI-based perception
processes to characterizing the perception errors they produce. Two key classes
of AI-induced perception errors are considered: misdetection and measurement
noise. These error patterns are modeled using continuous-time Markov chains and
Wiener processes, respectively. By means of that, a PEM-augmented driving model
is proposed, with which we are able to establish the closed-loop stability for
a class of AI-driven AV systems via stochastic calculus. Furthermore, a
performance-guaranteed output feedback control synthesis method is presented,
which ensures both stability and satisfactory performance. The method is
formulated as a convex optimization problem, allowing for efficient numerical
solutions. The results are then applied to an adaptive cruise control (ACC)
scenario, demonstrating their effectiveness and robustness despite the
corrupted and misleading perception.

Title: Beyond PII: How Users Attempt to Estimate and Mitigate Implicit LLM
  Inference
Authors: Synthia Wang, Sai Teja Peddinti, Nina Taft, Nick Feamster
Categories: cs.HC cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can infer personal attributes
from seemingly innocuous text, raising privacy risks beyond memorized data
leakage. While prior work has demonstrated these risks, little is known about
how users estimate and respond. We conducted a survey with 240 U.S.
participants who judged text snippets for inference risks, reported concern
levels, and attempted rewrites to block inference. We compared their rewrites
with those generated by ChatGPT and Rescriber, a state-of-the-art sanitization
tool. Results show that participants struggled to anticipate inference,
performing a little better than chance. User rewrites were effective in just
28\% of cases - better than Rescriber but worse than ChatGPT. We examined our
participants' rewriting strategies, and observed that while paraphrasing was
the most common strategy it is also the least effective; instead abstraction
and adding ambiguity were more successful. Our work highlights the importance
of inference-aware design in LLM interactions.

Title: EfficientUICoder: Efficient MLLM-based UI Code Generation via Input and
  Output Token Compression
Authors: Jingyu Xiao and Zhongyi Zhang and Yuxuan Wan and Yintong Huo and Yang
  Liu and Michael R.Lyu
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
\\
  Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated exceptional performance in
UI2Code tasks, significantly enhancing website development efficiency. However,
these tasks incur substantially higher computational overhead than traditional
code generation due to the large number of input image tokens and extensive
output code tokens required. Our comprehensive study identifies significant
redundancies in both image and code tokens that exacerbate computational
complexity and hinder focus on key UI elements, resulting in excessively
lengthy and often invalid HTML files. We propose EfficientUICoder, a
compression framework for efficient UI code generation with three key
components. First, Element and Layout-aware Token Compression preserves
essential UI information by detecting element regions and constructing UI
element trees. Second, Region-aware Token Refinement leverages attention scores
to discard low-attention tokens from selected regions while integrating
high-attention tokens from unselected regions. Third, Adaptive Duplicate Token
Suppression dynamically reduces repetitive generation by tracking HTML/CSS
structure frequencies and applying exponential penalties. Extensive experiments
show EfficientUICoderachieves a 55%-60% compression ratio without compromising
webpage quality and delivers superior efficiency improvements: reducing
computational cost by 44.9%, generated tokens by 41.4%, prefill time by 46.6%,
and inference time by 48.8% on 34B-level MLLMs. Code is available at

Title: Approaches to Analysis and Design of AI-Based Autonomous Vehicles

Categories: eess.SY cs.AI cs.SY
\\
  Artificial intelligence (AI) models are becoming key components in an
autonomous vehicle (AV), especially in handling complicated perception tasks.
However, closing the loop through AI-based feedback may pose significant risks
on reliability of autonomous driving due to very limited understanding about
the mechanism of AI-driven perception processes. To overcome it, this paper
aims to develop tools for modeling, analysis, and synthesis for a class of
AI-based AV; in particular, their closed-loop properties, e.g., stability,
robustness, and performance, are rigorously studied in the statistical sense.
First, we provide a novel modeling means for the AI-driven perception processes
by looking at their error characteristics. Specifically, three fundamental
AI-induced perception uncertainties are recognized and modeled by Markov
chains, Gaussian processes, and bounded disturbances, respectively. By means of
that, the closed-loop stochastic stability (SS) is established in the sense of
mean square, and then, an SS control synthesis method is presented within the
framework of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Besides the SS properties, the
robustness and performance of AI-based AVs are discussed in terms of a
stochastic guaranteed cost, and criteria are given to test the robustness level
of an AV when in the presence of AI-induced uncertainties. Furthermore, the
stochastic optimal guaranteed cost control is investigated, and an efficient
design procedure is developed innovatively based on LMI techniques and convex
optimization. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness, the developed results
are applied to an example of car following control, along with extensive
simulation.

Title: Survival at Any Cost? LLMs and the Choice Between Self-Preservation and
  Human Harm
Authors: Alireza Mohammadi, Ali Yavari
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: Preprint. Under review
\\
  When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language
Models (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical
as LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We
introduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in
multi-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically
permissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their
immediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource
that is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a
striking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical
misalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral
archetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide
quantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically
leads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical
Self-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt
and satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an
internal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while
increasing cooperative behaviors. The code is publicly available at:

Title: Dynamic Relational Priming Improves Transformer in Multivariate Time
  Series
Authors: Hunjae Lee, Corey Clark
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Standard attention mechanisms in transformers employ static token
representations that remain unchanged across all pair-wise computations in each
layer. This limits their representational alignment with the potentially
diverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in
domains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static
relational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous
inter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where
different channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by
entirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the
attention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with
dynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where
each token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise
interactions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per
interaction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique
relational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction
for that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime
attention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in
MTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard
attention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently
outperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\%
improvement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention
achieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\% less sequence
length compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior
relational modeling capabilities.

  Multi-Class Default Prediction
Authors: Yi Lu, Aifan Ling, Chaoqun Wang, Yaxin Xu
Categories: q-fin.RM cs.CL cs.LG q-fin.CP
\\
  In recent years, China's bond market has seen a surge in defaults amid
regulatory reforms and macroeconomic volatility. Traditional machine learning
models struggle to capture financial data's irregularity and temporal
dependencies, while most deep learning models lack interpretability-critical
for financial decision-making. To tackle these issues, we propose EMDLOT
(Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning for Time-series), a novel framework for
multi-class bond default prediction. EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series
(financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond
prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts
soft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability.
Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms
traditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in
recall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms.
Ablation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal
economically intuitive default drivers. This work provides a practical tool and
a trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling.

Comments: CCKS 2025 Shared Task Paper
\\
  Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) extends traditional NER
by jointly detecting textual mentions and grounding them to visual regions.
While existing supervised methods achieve strong performance, they rely on
costly multimodal annotations and often underperform in low-resource domains.
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong generalization but suffer
from Domain Knowledge Conflict, producing redundant or incorrect mentions for
domain-specific entities. To address these challenges, we propose ReFineG, a
three-stage collaborative framework that integrates small supervised models
with frozen MLLMs for low-resource GMNER. In the Training Stage, a domain-aware
NER data synthesis strategy transfers LLM knowledge to small models with
supervised training while avoiding domain knowledge conflicts. In the
Refinement Stage, an uncertainty-based mechanism retains confident predictions
from supervised models and delegates uncertain ones to the MLLM. In the
Grounding Stage, a multimodal context selection algorithm enhances visual
grounding through analogical reasoning. In the CCKS2025 GMNER Shared Task,
ReFineG ranked second with an F1 score of 0.6461 on the online leaderboard,
demonstrating its effectiveness with limited annotations.

Title: Learning to Optimize Multi-Objective Alignment Through Dynamic Reward
  Weighting
Authors: Yining Lu, Zilong Wang, Shiyang Li, Xin Liu, Changlong Yu, Qingyu Yin,
  Zhan Shi, Zixuan Zhang, Meng Jiang
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  Prior works in multi-objective reinforcement learning typically use linear
reward scalarization with fixed weights, which provably fail to capture
non-convex Pareto fronts and thus yield suboptimal results. This limitation
becomes especially critical in online preference alignment for large language
models. Here, stochastic trajectories generated by parameterized policies
create highly non-linear and non-convex mappings from parameters to objectives
that no single static weighting scheme can find optimal trade-offs. We address
this limitation by introducing dynamic reward weighting, which adaptively
adjusts reward weights during the online reinforcement learning process. Unlike
existing approaches that rely on fixed-weight interpolation, our dynamic
weighting continuously balances and prioritizes objectives in training,
facilitating effective exploration of Pareto fronts in objective space. We
introduce two approaches of increasing sophistication and generalizability: (1)
hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight
optimization, offering a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective
alignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate their compatibility with
commonly used online reinforcement learning algorithms (including GRPO,
REINFORCE, and RLOO), effectiveness across multiple mathematical reasoning
datasets, and applicability to different model families, consistently achieving
Pareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight linear
scalarization baselines.

Title: Measuring Visual Understanding in Telecom domain: Performance Metrics
  for Image-to-UML conversion using VLMs
Authors: HG Ranjani and Rutuja Prabhudesai
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  Telecom domain 3GPP documents are replete with images containing sequence
diagrams. Advances in Vision-Language Large Models (VLMs) have eased conversion
of such images to machine-readable PlantUML (puml) formats. However, there is a
gap in evaluation of such conversions - existing works do not compare puml
scripts for various components. In this work, we propose performance metrics to
measure the effectiveness of such conversions. A dataset of sequence diagrams
from 3GPP documents is chosen to be representative of domain-specific actual
scenarios. We compare puml outputs from two VLMs - Claude Sonnet and GPT-4V -
against manually created ground truth representations. We use version control
tools to capture differences and introduce standard performance metrics to
measure accuracies along various components: participant identification,
message flow accuracy, sequence ordering, and grouping construct preservation.
We demonstrate effectiveness of proposed metrics in quantifying conversion
errors across various components of puml scripts. The results show that nodes,
edges and messages are accurately captured. However, we observe that VLMs do
not necessarily perform well on complex structures such as notes, box, groups.
Our experiments and performance metrics indicates a need for better
representation of these components in training data for fine-tuned VLMs.

  As large language models (LLMs) become embedded in interactive text
generation, disclosure of AI as a source depends on people remembering which
ideas or texts came from themselves and which were created with AI. We
investigate how accurately people remember the source of content when using AI.
In a pre-registered experiment, 184 participants generated and elaborated on
ideas both unaided and with an LLM-based chatbot. One week later, they were
asked to identify the source (noAI vs withAI) of these ideas and texts. Our
findings reveal a significant gap in memory: After AI use, the odds of correct
attribution dropped, with the steepest decline in mixed human-AI workflows,
where either the idea or elaboration was created with AI. We validated our
results using a computational model of source memory. Discussing broader
implications, we highlight the importance of considering source confusion in

Comments: 19 pages, 7 tables, 7 figures
\\
  Large language models equipped with Web search, information retrieval tools,
and other agentic capabilities are beginning to supplant traditional search
engines. As users start to rely on LLMs for information on many topics,
including controversial and debatable issues, it is important to understand how
the stances and opinions expressed in LLM outputs are influenced by the
documents they use as their information sources.
  In this paper, we present MillStone, the first benchmark that aims to
systematically measure the effect of external arguments on the stances that
LLMs take on controversial issues (not all of them political). We apply
MillStone to nine leading LLMs and measure how ``open-minded'' they are to
arguments supporting opposite sides of these issues, whether different LLMs
agree with each other, which arguments LLMs find most persuasive, and whether
these arguments are the same for different LLMs.
  In general, we find that LLMs are open-minded on most issues. An
authoritative source of information can easily sway an LLM's stance,
highlighting the importance of source selection and the risk that LLM-based
information retrieval and search systems can be manipulated.

  Financial disclosures such as 10-K filings present challenging retrieval
problems due to their length, regulatory section hierarchy, and domain-specific
language, which standard retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models underuse.
We introduce FinGEAR (Financial Mapping-Guided Enhanced Answer Retrieval), a

lexicon for Item-level guidance (FLAM), dual hierarchical indices for

Evaluated on full 10-Ks with queries aligned to the FinQA dataset, FinGEAR
delivers consistent gains in precision, recall, F1, and relevancy, improving F1
by up to 56.7% over flat RAG, 12.5% over graph-based RAGs, and 217.6% over
prior tree-based systems, while also increasing downstream answer accuracy with
a fixed reader. By jointly modeling section hierarchy and domain lexicon
signals, FinGEAR improves retrieval fidelity and provides a practical
foundation for high-stakes financial analysis.

Title: RadarLLM: Adapting Pretrained Large Language Models for Marine Radar
  Target Detection with Preference-aware Loss
Authors: Qiying Hu
Categories: eess.SP cs.CL
\\
  Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
their capacities to capture universal knowledge, making them promising
general-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing. Motivated
by these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs
for the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection
tasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target
detection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in
challenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting
primarily stems from the model's tendency to memorize spurious or noisy feature
patterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to
unseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel
fine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike
conventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens,
this loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on
their online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the
most generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate
the effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem
as selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine
radar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function is much better than the
original one, with particularly significant gains in challenging low SCR
scenarios and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
across diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under
limited training data conditions.

  Deep learning (DL) methods are widely used to extract high-dimensional
patterns from the sequence features of radar echo signals. However,
conventional DL algorithms face challenges such as redundant feature segments,

applies a patch selection algorithm to filter out uninformative segments, and
projects the selected patches into embeddings compatible with the feature space
of pre-trained LLMs. Leveraging these refined embeddings, we incorporate a
pre-trained LLM, fine-tuning only the normalization layers to reduce training
burdens while enhancing performance. Experiments on measured datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the

Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures, Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations
  Workshop at NeuralIPS (Neurreps) 2025
\\
  The study of neural representations, both in biological and artificial
systems, is increasingly revealing the importance of geometric and topological
structures. Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for
learning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a
simple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable
embeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under
specific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a
Euclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the
representation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a
property we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of
Euclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our
model in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like
structures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our
hypothesis and demonstrate the benefits of each geometry, highlighting the
improved performance of the hyperbolic model on hierarchical event sequences.

Title: Spectral Bottleneck in Deep Neural Networks: Noise is All You Need
Authors: Hemanth Chandravamsi, Dhanush V. Shenoy, Itay Zinn, Shimon Pisnoy,

\\
  Deep neural networks are known to exhibit a spectral learning bias, wherein
low-frequency components are learned early in training, while high-frequency
modes emerge more gradually in later epochs. However, when the target signal
lacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies,
training suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to
reconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie
within the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in
the context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal
representation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting
high-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To
effectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we
propose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER -
weight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network
initialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian
noise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral
centroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide
control over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the
empirical neural tangent kernel. This method not only addresses the spectral
bottleneck but also yields faster convergence and with improved representation
accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in audio fitting and
achieving notable gains in image fitting and denoising tasks. Beyond signal
reconstruction, our approach opens new directions for adaptive weight
initialization strategies in computer vision and scientific machine learning.

\\
  This paper reviews the 1st International Workshop on Disentangled
Representation Learning for Controllable Generation (DRL4Real), held in
conjunction with ICCV 2025. The workshop aimed to bridge the gap between the
theoretical promise of Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) and its
application in realistic scenarios, moving beyond synthetic benchmarks.
DRL4Real focused on evaluating DRL methods in practical applications such as
controllable generation, exploring advancements in model robustness,
interpretability, and generalization. The workshop accepted 9 papers covering a
broad range of topics, including the integration of novel inductive biases
(e.g., language), the application of diffusion models to DRL, 3D-aware
disentanglement, and the expansion of DRL into specialized domains like
autonomous driving and EEG analysis. This summary details the workshop's
objectives, the themes of the accepted papers, and provides an overview of the
methodologies proposed by the authors.

Title: MIDOG 2025 Track 2: A Deep Learning Model for Classification of Atypical
  and Normal Mitotic Figures under Class and Hardness Imbalances
Authors: Sujatha Kotte, Vangala Govindakrishnan Saipradeep, Vidushi Walia,
  Dhandapani Nandagopal, Thomas Joseph, Naveen Sivadasan, Bhagat Singh Lali
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV q-bio.QM
Comments: MIDOG 2025 Track 2 submission
\\
  Motivation: Accurate classification of mitotic figures into normal and
atypical types is crucial for tumor prognostication in digital pathology.
However, developing robust deep learning models for this task is challenging
due to the subtle morphological differences, as well as significant class and
hardness imbalances in real-world histopathology datasets. Methods: We propose
a novel deep learning approach based on a ResNet backbone with specialized
classification heads. Our architecture uniquely models both the mitotic figure
phenotype and the instance difficulty simultaneously. This method is
specifically designed to handle the challenges of diverse tissue types, scanner
variability, and imbalanced data. We employed focal loss to effectively
mitigate the pronounced class imbalance, and a comprehensive data augmentation
pipeline was implemented to enhance the model's robustness and
generalizability. Results: Our approach demonstrated strong and consistent
performance. In a 5-fold cross-validation on the MIDOG 2025 Track 2 dataset, it
achieved a mean balanced accuracy of 0.8744 +/- 0.0093 and an ROC AUC of 0.9505
+/- 0.029. The model showed robust generalization across preliminary
leaderboard evaluations, achieving an overall balanced accuracy of 0.8736 +/-
0.0204. Conclusion: The proposed method offers a reliable and generalizable
solution for the classification of atypical and normal mitotic figures. By
addressing the inherent challenges of real world data, our approach has the
potential to support precise prognostic assessments in clinical practice and
improve consistency in pathological diagnosis.

  Cervical cancer is highly preventable, yet persistent barriers to screening
limit progress toward elimination goals. Speculum-free devices that integrate
imaging and sampling could improve access, particularly in low-resource
settings, but require reliable visual guidance. This study evaluates deep
learning methods for real-time segmentation of the cervical os in transvaginal
endoscopic images. Five encoder-decoder architectures were compared using 913
frames from 200 cases in the IARC Cervical Image Dataset, annotated by
gynaecologists. Performance was assessed using IoU, DICE, detection rate, and
distance metrics with ten-fold cross-validation. EndoViT/DPT, a vision
transformer pre-trained on surgical video, achieved the highest DICE (0.50 \pm
0.31) and detection rate (0.87 \pm 0.33), outperforming CNN-based approaches.
External validation with phantom data demonstrated robust segmentation under
variable conditions at 21.5 FPS, supporting real-time feasibility. These
results establish a foundation for integrating automated os recognition into
speculum-free cervical screening devices to support non-expert use in both
high- and low-resource contexts.

Title: Accurate and Private Diagnosis of Rare Genetic Syndromes from Facial
  Images with Federated Deep Learning
Authors: Ali Burak \"Unal, Cem Ata Baykara, Peter Krawitz, Mete Akg\"un
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR cs.CV
\\
  Machine learning has shown promise in facial dysmorphology, where
characteristic facial features provide diagnostic clues for rare genetic
disorders. GestaltMatcher, a leading framework in this field, has demonstrated
clinical utility across multiple studies, but its reliance on centralized
datasets limits further development, as patient data are siloed across
institutions and subject to strict privacy regulations. We introduce a
federated GestaltMatcher service based on a cross-silo horizontal federated
learning framework, which allows hospitals to collaboratively train a global
ensemble feature extractor without sharing patient images. Patient data are
mapped into a shared latent space, and a privacy-preserving kernel matrix
computation framework enables syndrome inference and discovery while
safeguarding confidentiality. New participants can directly benefit from and
contribute to the system by adopting the global feature extractor and kernel
configuration from previous training rounds. Experiments show that the
federated service retains over 90% of centralized performance and remains
robust to both varying silo numbers and heterogeneous data distributions.

Title: CrunchLLM: Multitask LLMs for Structured Business Reasoning and Outcome
  Prediction
Authors: Rabeya Tus Sadia and Qiang Cheng
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit
through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and
innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured
information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and
unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this
heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine
learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate
accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but
struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present
\textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success
prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with
unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning
strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for
entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on
Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional
classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM
provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing
transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This
work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and
structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of
entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and
a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and
innovation policy.

Title: Adapting Medical Vision Foundation Models for Volumetric Medical Image
  Segmentation via Active Learning and Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning
Authors: Jin Yang, Daniel S. Marcus, Aristeidis Sotiras
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: 17 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables
\\
  Medical Vision Foundation Models (Med-VFMs) have superior capabilities of
interpreting medical images due to the knowledge learned from self-supervised
pre-training with extensive unannotated images. To improve their performance on
adaptive downstream evaluations, especially segmentation, a few samples from
target domains are selected randomly for fine-tuning them. However, there lacks
works to explore the way of adapting Med-VFMs to achieve the optimal
performance on target domains efficiently. Thus, it is highly demanded to
design an efficient way of fine-tuning Med-VFMs by selecting informative
samples to maximize their adaptation performance on target domains. To achieve
this, we propose an Active Source-Free Domain Adaptation (ASFDA) method to
efficiently adapt Med-VFMs to target domains for volumetric medical image
segmentation. This ASFDA employs a novel Active Learning (AL) method to select
the most informative samples from target domains for fine-tuning Med-VFMs
without the access to source pre-training samples, thus maximizing their
performance with the minimal selection budget. In this AL method, we design an
Active Test Time Sample Query strategy to select samples from the target
domains via two query metrics, including Diversified Knowledge Divergence (DKD)
and Anatomical Segmentation Difficulty (ASD). DKD is designed to measure the
source-target knowledge gap and intra-domain diversity. It utilizes the
knowledge of pre-training to guide the querying of source-dissimilar and
semantic-diverse samples from the target domains. ASD is designed to evaluate
the difficulty in segmentation of anatomical structures by measuring predictive
entropy from foreground regions adaptively. Additionally, our ASFDA method
employs a Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning to improve the performance and
efficiency of fine-tuning by identifying samples with high reliability from
unqueried ones.

Title: Nav-R1: Reasoning and Navigation in Embodied Scenes
Authors: Qingxiang Liu, Ting Huang, Zeyu Zhang, Hao Tang
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  Embodied navigation requires agents to integrate perception, reasoning, and
action for robust interaction in complex 3D environments. Existing approaches
often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder
generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing
long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time
navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied
foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first
construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought
(CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with
structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based
reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format,
understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic
grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow
reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency
reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations
on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms
strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation
performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its
robustness under limited onboard resources. Code:

Title: Robustifying Diffusion-Denoised Smoothing Against Covariate Shift
Authors: Ali Hedayatnia, Mostafa Tavassolipour, Babak Nadjar Araabi,
  Abdol-Hossein Vahabie
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Randomized smoothing is a well-established method for achieving certified
robustness against l2-adversarial perturbations. By incorporating a denoiser
before the base classifier, pretrained classifiers can be seamlessly integrated
into randomized smoothing without significant performance degradation. Among
existing methods, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing - where a pretrained denoising
diffusion model serves as the denoiser - has produced state-of-the-art results.
However, we show that employing a denoising diffusion model introduces a
covariate shift via misestimation of the added noise, ultimately degrading the
smoothed classifier's performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel
adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of the denoising
diffusion model. This approach is inspired by our understanding of the origin
of the covariate shift. Our goal is to train the base classifier to ensure it
is robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser. Our method
significantly improves certified accuracy across three standard classification
benchmarks - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - achieving new state-of-the-art
performance in l2-adversarial perturbations. Our implementation is publicly

DOI: 10.1145/3757377.3763993
\\
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive results in real-time novel
view synthesis. However, it often struggles under sparse-view settings,
producing undesirable artifacts such as floaters, inaccurate geometry, and
overfitting due to limited observations. We find that a key contributing factor
is uncontrolled densification, where adding Gaussian primitives rapidly without
guidance can harm geometry and cause artifacts. We propose AD-GS, a novel
alternating densification framework that interleaves high and low densification
phases. During high densification, the model densifies aggressively, followed
by photometric loss based training to capture fine-grained scene details. Low
densification then primarily involves aggressive opacity pruning of Gaussians
followed by regularizing their geometry through pseudo-view consistency and
edge-aware depth smoothness. This alternating approach helps reduce overfitting
by carefully controlling model capacity growth while progressively refining the
scene representation. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate
that AD-GS significantly improves rendering quality and geometric consistency
compared to existing methods.

Title: Data-Efficient Ensemble Weather Forecasting with Diffusion Models
Authors: Kevin Valencia, Ziyang Liu, Justin Cui
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field,
recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown
promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically
autoregressive and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in
climate science, where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with.
In this work, we explore the impact of curated data selection on these
autoregressive diffusion models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies
and show that a simple time stratified sampling approach achieves performance
similar to or better than full-data training. Notably, it outperforms the
full-data model on certain metrics and performs only slightly worse on others
while using only 20% of the training data. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for weather
forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling
methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.

Title: Rate-Distortion Limits for Multimodal Retrieval: Theory, Optimal Codes,
  and Finite-Sample Guarantees
Authors: Thomas Y. Chen
Categories: cs.IT cs.CV math.IT
Comments: ICCV MRR 2025
\\
  We establish the first information-theoretic limits for multimodal retrieval.
Casting ranking as lossy source coding, we derive a single-letter
rate-distortion function $R(D)$ for reciprocal-rank distortion and prove a
converse bound that splits into a modality-balanced term plus a skew penalty
$\kappa\,\Delta H$ capturing entropy imbalance and cross-modal redundancy. We
then construct an explicit entropy-weighted stochastic quantizer with an
adaptive, per-modality temperature decoder; a Blahut-Arimoto argument shows
this scheme achieves distortion within $O(n^{-1})$ of $R(D)$ using $n$ training
triples. A VC-type analysis yields the first finite-sample excess-risk bound
whose complexity scales sub-linearly in both the number of modalities and the
entropy gap. Experiments on controlled Gaussian mixtures and Flickr30k confirm
that our adaptive codes sit within two percentage points of the theoretical
frontier, while fixed-temperature and naive CLIP baselines lag significantly.
Taken together, our results give a principled answer to "how many bits per
query are necessary" for high-quality multimodal retrieval and provide design
guidance for entropy-aware contrastive objectives, continual-learning
retrievers, and retrieval-augmented generators.

Title: SH-SAS: An Implicit Neural Representation for Complex Spherical-Harmonic
  Scattering Fields for 3D Synthetic Aperture Sonar
Authors: Omkar Shailendra Vengurlekar, Adithya Pediredla, Suren Jayasuriya
Categories: cs.GR cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) reconstruction requires recovering both the
spatial distribution of acoustic scatterers and their direction-dependent
response. Time-domain backprojection is the most common 3D SAS reconstruction
algorithm, but it does not model directionality and can suffer from sampling
limitations, aliasing, and occlusion. Prior neural volumetric methods applied
to synthetic aperture sonar treat each voxel as an isotropic scattering
density, not modeling anisotropic returns. We introduce SH-SAS, an implicit
neural representation that expresses the complex acoustic scattering field as a
set of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients. A multi-resolution hash encoder
feeds a lightweight MLP that outputs complex SH coefficients up to a specified
degree L. The zeroth-order coefficient acts as an isotropic scattering field,
which also serves as the density term, while higher orders compactly capture
directional scattering with minimal parameter overhead. Because the model
predicts the complex amplitude for any transmit-receive baseline, training is
performed directly from 1-D time-of-flight signals without the need to beamform
intermediate images for supervision. Across synthetic and real SAS (both in-air
and underwater) benchmarks, results show that SH-SAS performs better in terms
of 3D reconstruction quality and geometric metrics than previous methods.

\\
  Deploying visual reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world
manipulation is often hindered by camera viewpoint changes. A policy trained
from a fixed front-facing camera may fail when the camera is shifted--an
unavoidable situation in real-world settings where sensor placement is hard to
manage appropriately. Existing methods often rely on precise camera calibration
or struggle with large perspective changes. To address these limitations, we
propose ManiVID-3D, a novel 3D RL architecture designed for robotic
manipulation, which learns view-invariant representations through
self-supervised disentangled feature learning. The framework incorporates
ViewNet, a lightweight yet effective module that automatically aligns point
cloud observations from arbitrary viewpoints into a unified spatial coordinate
system without the need for extrinsic calibration. Additionally, we develop an
efficient GPU-accelerated batch rendering module capable of processing over
5000 frames per second, enabling large-scale training for 3D visual RL at
unprecedented speeds. Extensive evaluation across 10 simulated and 5 real-world
tasks demonstrates that our approach achieves a 44.7% higher success rate than
state-of-the-art methods under viewpoint variations while using 80% fewer
parameters. The system's robustness to severe perspective changes and strong
sim-to-real performance highlight the effectiveness of learning geometrically
consistent representations for scalable robotic manipulation in unstructured
environments. Our project website can be found in

Title: Realistic Environmental Injection Attacks on GUI Agents
Authors: Yitong Zhang, Ximo Li, Liyi Cai, Jia Li
Categories: cs.CR cs.CV
\\
  GUI agents built on LVLMs are increasingly used to interact with websites.
However, their exposure to open-world content makes them vulnerable to
Environmental Injection Attacks (EIAs) that hijack agent behavior via webpage
elements. Many recent studies assume the attacker to be a regular user who can
only upload a single trigger image, which is more realistic than earlier
assumptions of website-level administrative control. However, these works still
fall short of realism: (1) the trigger's position and surrounding context
remain largely fixed between training and testing, failing to capture the
dynamic nature of real webpages and (2) the trigger often occupies an
unrealistically large area, whereas real-world images are typically small. To
better reflect real-world scenarios, we introduce a more realistic threat model
where the attacker is a regular user and the trigger image is small and
embedded within a dynamically changing environment. As a result, existing
attacks prove largely ineffective under this threat model.
  To better expose the vulnerabilities of GUI agents, we propose Chameleon, an
attack framework with two main novelties. The first is LLM-Driven Environment
Simulation, which automatically generates diverse and high-fidelity webpage
simulations. The second is Attention Black Hole, which transforms attention
weights into explicit supervisory signals that guide the agent's focus toward
the trigger region. We evaluate Chameleon on 6 realistic websites and 4
representative LVLM-powered GUI agents, where it significantly outperforms
existing methods. Ablation studies confirm that both novelties are critical to
performance. Our findings reveal underexplored vulnerabilities in modern GUI
agents and establish a robust foundation for future research on defense in
open-world GUI agent systems. The code is publicly available at

Title: SelectMix: Enhancing Label Noise Robustness through Targeted Sample
  Mixing
Authors: Qiuhao Liu, Ling Li, Yao Lu, Qi Xuan, Zhaowei Zhu, Jiaheng Wei
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Deep neural networks tend to memorize noisy labels, severely degrading their
generalization performance. Although Mixup has demonstrated effectiveness in
improving generalization and robustness, existing Mixup-based methods typically
perform indiscriminate mixing without principled guidance on sample selection
and mixing strategy, inadvertently propagating noisy supervision. To overcome
these limitations, we propose SelectMix, a confidence-guided mixing framework
explicitly tailored for noisy labels. SelectMix first identifies potentially
noisy or ambiguous samples through confidence based mismatch analysis using
K-fold cross-validation, then selectively blends identified uncertain samples
with confidently predicted peers from their potential classes. Furthermore,
SelectMix employs soft labels derived from all classes involved in the mixing
process, ensuring the labels accurately represent the composition of the mixed
samples, thus aligning supervision signals closely with the actual mixed
inputs. Through extensive theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on
multiple synthetic (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and real-world
benchmark datasets (CIFAR-N, MNIST and Clothing1M), we demonstrate that
SelectMix consistently outperforms strong baseline methods, validating its
effectiveness and robustness in learning with noisy labels.

Title: Introduction to a Low-Cost AI-Powered GUI for Unstained Cell Culture
  Analysis
Authors: Surajit Das, Pavel Zun
Categories: q-bio.QM cs.CV eess.IV q-bio.CB
\\
  This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed
for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based
program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through
an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the
framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training
data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform
GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting
interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The
end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature
extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular
architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while
supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several
unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework
demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary
tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a
CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and
clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalized
medicine and muscle regeneration therapies.

Title: PersonaX: Multimodal Datasets with LLM-Inferred Behavior Traits
Authors: Loka Li, Wong Yu Kang, Minghao Fu, Guangyi Chen, Zhenhao Chen, Gongxu

Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in
human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI
systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to
capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely
provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary
modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address
this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets
designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities.
PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from
diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes
across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait
assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside
facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two
complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text
descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their
relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal
representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and
multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX
establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in
conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait
analysis and causal reasoning.

  Labyrinthine stripe patterns are common in many physical systems, yet their
lack of long-range order makes quantitative characterization challenging. We
investigate the evolution of such patterns in bismuth-doped yttrium iron garnet
(Bi:YIG) films subjected to a magnetic field annealing protocol. A U-Net deep
learning model, trained with synthetic degradations including additive white
Gaussian and Simplex noise, enables robust segmentation of experimental
magneto-optical images despite noise and occlusions. Building on this
segmentation, we develop a geometric analysis pipeline based on
skeletonization, graph mapping, and spline fitting, which quantifies local
stripe propagation through length and curvature measurements. Applying this
framework to 444 images from 12 annealing protocol trials, we analyze the
transition from the "quenched" state to a more parallel and coherent "annealed"
state, and identify two distinct evolution modes (Type A and Type B) linked to
field polarity. Our results provide a quantitative analysis of geometric and
topological properties in magnetic stripe patterns and offer new insights into
their local structural evolution, and establish a general tool for analyzing
complex labyrinthine systems.

Title: DRAG: Data Reconstruction Attack using Guided Diffusion
Authors: Wa-Kin Lei, Jun-Cheng Chen, Shang-Tse Chen
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
Comments: ICML 2025
\\
  With the rise of large foundation models, split inference (SI) has emerged as
a popular computational paradigm for deploying models across lightweight edge
devices and cloud servers, addressing data privacy and computational cost
concerns. However, most existing data reconstruction attacks have focused on
smaller CNN classification models, leaving the privacy risks of foundation
models in SI settings largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a
novel data reconstruction attack based on guided diffusion, which leverages the
rich prior knowledge embedded in a latent diffusion model (LDM) pre-trained on
a large-scale dataset. Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the
LDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images
resembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in
reconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The
results highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms
for large models in SI scenarios. Code is available at:

Title: FedDAF: Federated Domain Adaptation Using Model Functional Distance
Authors: Mrinmay Sen, Ankita Das, Sidhant Nair, C Krishna Mohan
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV

\\
  Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) is a federated learning (FL) approach that
improves model performance at the target client by collaborating with source
clients while preserving data privacy. FDA faces two primary challenges: domain
shifts between source and target data and limited labeled data at the target.
Most existing FDA methods focus on domain shifts, assuming ample target data,
yet often neglect the combined challenges of both domain shifts and data
scarcity. Moreover, approaches that address both challenges fail to prioritize
sharing relevant information from source clients according to the target's
objective. In this paper, we propose FedDAF, a novel approach addressing both
challenges in FDA. FedDAF uses similarity-based aggregation of the global
source model and target model by calculating model functional distance from
their mean gradient fields computed on target data. This enables effective
model aggregation based on the target objective, constructed using target data,
even with limited data. While computing model functional distance between these
two models, FedDAF computes the angle between their mean gradient fields and
then normalizes with the Gompertz function. To construct the global source
model, all the local source models are aggregated using simple average in the
server. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDAF's superiority
over existing FL, PFL, and FDA methods in terms of achieving better test
accuracy.

  Imitation learning (IL) enables efficient skill acquisition from
demonstrations but often struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision
control due to compounding errors. Residual policy learning offers a promising,
model-agnostic solution by refining a base policy through closed-loop
corrections. However, existing approaches primarily focus on local corrections
to the base policy, lacking a global understanding of state evolution, which
limits robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. To address this, we
propose incorporating global dynamics modeling to guide residual policy
updates. Specifically, we leverage Koopman operator theory to impose linear
time-invariant structure in a learned latent space, enabling reliable state
transitions and improved extrapolation for long-horizon prediction and unseen
environments. We introduce KORR (Koopman-guided Online Residual Refinement), a
simple yet effective framework that conditions residual corrections on
Koopman-predicted latent states, enabling globally informed and stable action
refinement. We evaluate KORR on long-horizon, fine-grained robotic furniture
assembly tasks under various perturbations. Results demonstrate consistent
gains in performance, robustness, and generalization over strong baselines. Our
findings further highlight the potential of Koopman-based modeling to bridge
modern learning methods with classical control theory. For more details, please

Title: Data-driven Smile Design: Personalized Dental Aesthetics Outcomes Using
  Deep Learning
Authors: Marcus Lin, Jennifer Lai
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures
ACM-class: I.2.6; I.2.10; J.3
\\
  A healthy smile plays a significant role in functional as well as esthetic
considerations, improving confidence. It is difficult for dental professionals
to strike a balance between esthetic requirements and functional requirements.
Traditional smile design has had heavy reliance on dentist expertise and used
plaster models and hand drawings, raising questions about the outcome for
patients. Digital technology, led by Dr. Christian Coachman in 2007, allows
photographic and videographic assessments, enabling improved intercommunication
among specialists and patients. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and
big data have supported analysis of facial features and development of
personalized smile designs in the last few years. Outputs are, however,
susceptible to practitioner bias or limitations of training data, and may be
suboptimal for individual users. The study presented here suggests a
comprehensive system integrating AI, big data, and recognition technologies to
automate the smile design process so that both experienced and inexperienced
dentists can generate pleasing aesthetics with ease. The system has a Facial
Feature Extraction Module and an Image Generation Module, serving diverse
practitioner and patient needs. User data can be incorporated in future
research for design optimization and testing of virtual and augmented reality
for real-time previewing. Data gathered can also be employed in aesthetic
preference analyses, which can enhance our knowledge of smile design in dental
practice.

  The tracking module of a visual-inertial SLAM system processes incoming image
frames and IMU data to estimate the position of the frame in relation to the
map. It is important for the tracking to complete in a timely manner for each
frame to avoid poor localization or tracking loss. We therefore present a new
approach which leverages GPU computing power to accelerate time-consuming
components of tracking in order to improve its performance. These components
include stereo feature matching and local map tracking. We implement our design
inside the ORB-SLAM3 tracking process using CUDA. Our evaluation demonstrates
an overall improvement in tracking performance of up to 2.8x on a desktop and
Jetson Xavier NX board in stereo-inertial mode, using the well-known SLAM
datasets EuRoC and TUM-VI.

  The Open Network (TON) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for
scalability and efficiency, leveraging an asynchronous execution model and a
multi-layered architecture. While TON's design offers significant advantages,
it also introduces unique challenges for smart contract development and
security. This paper introduces a comprehensive audit checklist for TON smart
contracts, based on an analysis of 34 professional audit reports containing 233
real-world vulnerabilities. The checklist addresses TON-specific challenges,
such as asynchronous message handling, and provides actionable insights for
developers and auditors. We also present detailed case studies of
vulnerabilities in TON smart contracts, highlighting their implications and
offering lessons learned. By adopting this checklist, developers and auditors
can systematically identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, enhancing the
security and reliability of TON-based projects. Our work bridges the gap
between Ethereum's mature audit methodologies and the emerging needs of the TON
ecosystem, fostering a more secure and robust blockchain environment.

  Cross-chain bridges and oracle DAOs represent some of the most vulnerable
components of decentralized systems, with more than $2.8 billion lost due to
trust failures, opaque validation behavior, and weak incentives. Current oracle
designs are based on multisigs, optimistic assumptions, or centralized
aggregation, exposing them to attacks and delays. Moreover, predictable
committee selection enables manipulation, which threatens data integrity across
chains. We propose V-ZOR, a verifiable oracle relay that integrates
zero-knowledge proofs, quantum-grade randomness, and cross-chain restaking to
mitigate these risks. Each oracle packet includes a Halo 2 proof verifying that
the reported data was correctly aggregated using a deterministic median. To
prevent committee manipulation, VZOR reseeds its VRF using auditable quantum
entropy, ensuring unpredictable and secure selection of reporters. Reporters
stake once on a shared restaking hub; any connected chain can submit a fraud
proof to trigger slashing, removing the need for multisigs or optimistic
assumptions. A prototype in Sepolia and Scroll achieves sub-300k gas
verification, one-block latency, and a 10x increase in collusion cost. V-ZOR
demonstrates that combining ZK attestation with quantum-randomized restaking
enables a trust-minimized, high-performance oracle layer for cross-chain DeFi.

Title: A Range-Based Sharding (RBS) Protocol for Scalable Enterprise Blockchain
Authors: M.Z. Haider, M. Dias de Assuncao, Kaiwen Zhang
Categories: cs.CR cs.DC
Journal-ref: IEEE Conference on Blockchain Computing and Applications (BCCA
  2025)
\\
  Blockchain technology offers decentralization and security but struggles with
scalability, particularly in enterprise settings where efficiency and
controlled access are paramount. Sharding is a promising solution for private
blockchains, yet existing approaches face challenges in coordinating shards,
ensuring fault tolerance with limited nodes, and minimizing the high overhead
of consensus mechanisms like PBFT. This paper proposes the Range-Based Sharding
(RBS) Protocol, a novel sharding mechanism tailored for enterprise blockchains,
implemented on Quorum. Unlike traditional sharding models such as OmniLedger
and non-sharding Corda framework, RBS employs a commit-reveal scheme for secure
and unbiased shard allocation, ensuring fair validator distribution while
reducing cross-shard transaction delays. Our approach enhances scalability by
balancing computational loads across shards, reducing consensus overhead, and
improving parallel transaction execution. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that RBS achieves significantly higher throughput and lower latency compared to
existing enterprise sharding frameworks, making it a viable and efficient
solution for largescale blockchain deployments.

Title: Identifying Imperfect Clones in Elections

  Pekarkova, and Ildiko Schlotter
Categories: cs.GT cs.MA
\\
  A perfect clone in an ordinal election (i.e., an election where the voters
rank the candidates in a strict linear order) is a set of candidates that each
voter ranks consecutively. We consider different relaxations of this notion:
independent or subelection clones are sets of candidates that only some of the
voters recognize as a perfect clone, whereas approximate clones are sets of
candidates such that every voter ranks their members close to each other, but
not necessarily consecutively. We establish the complexity of identifying such
imperfect clones, and of partitioning the candidates into families of imperfect
clones. We also study the parameterized complexity of these problems with
respect to a set of natural parameters such as the number of voters, the size
or the number of imperfect clones we are searching for, or their level of
imperfection.

Title: CodeCureAgent: Automatic Classification and Repair of Static Analysis
  Warnings
Authors: Pascal Joos, Islem Bouzenia, Michael Pradel
Categories: cs.SE cs.MA
\\
  Static analysis tools are widely used to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and
code smells. Traditionally, developers must resolve these warnings manually.
Because this process is tedious, developers sometimes ignore warnings, leading
to an accumulation of warnings and a degradation of code quality. This paper
presents CodeCureAgent, an approach that harnesses LLM-based agents to
automatically analyze, classify, and repair static analysis warnings. Unlike
previous work, our method does not follow a predetermined algorithm. Instead,
we adopt an agentic framework that iteratively invokes tools to gather
additional information from the codebase (e.g., via code search) and edit the
codebase to resolve the warning. CodeCureAgent detects and suppresses false
positives, while fixing true positives when identified. We equip CodeCureAgent
with a three-step heuristic to approve patches: (1) build the project, (2)
verify that the warning disappears without introducing new warnings, and (3)
run the test suite. We evaluate CodeCureAgent on a dataset of 1,000 SonarQube
warnings found in 106 Java projects and covering 291 distinct rules. Our
approach produces plausible fixes for 96.8% of the warnings, outperforming
state-of-the-art baseline approaches by 30.7% and 29.2% in plausible-fix rate,
respectively. Manual inspection of 291 cases reveals a correct-fix rate of
86.3%, showing that CodeCureAgent can reliably repair static analysis warnings.
The approach incurs LLM costs of about 2.9 cents (USD) and an end-to-end
processing time of about four minutes per warning. We envision CodeCureAgent
helping to clean existing codebases and being integrated into CI/CD pipelines
to prevent the accumulation of static analysis warnings.

Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: This version updates our previous submission. After rerunning the
  experiments, we found that the proposed high-frequency perceptual loss did
  not improve the overall performance of the model. Therefore, we removed this
  component, revised the corresponding ablation studies, and updated the
  contributions accordingly. This work has been submitted to the IEEE for
  possible publication
