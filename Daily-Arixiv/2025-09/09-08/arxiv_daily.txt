Title: Renewable Energy Sources Selection Analysis with the Maximizing
  Deviation Method
Authors: Kirisci Murat
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 25 pages, 5 figures, 6 Tables
MSC-class: 03E72, 94D05,
\\
  Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

Title: From Eigenmodes to Proofs: Integrating Graph Spectral Operators with
  Symbolic Interpretable Reasoning
Authors: Andrew Kiruluta and Priscilla Burity
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Title: Statistical Methods in Generative AI
Authors: Edgar Dobriban
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG stat.ME
Comments: Invited review paper for Annual Review of Statistics and Its
  Application. Feedback welcome
\\
  Generative Artificial Intelligence is emerging as an important technology,
promising to be transformative in many areas. At the same time, generative AI
techniques are based on sampling from probabilistic models, and by default,
they come with no guarantees about correctness, safety, fairness, or other
properties. Statistical methods offer a promising potential approach to improve
the reliability of generative AI techniques. In addition, statistical methods
are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation,
as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI.
  In this paper, we review some of the existing work on these topics,
explaining both the general statistical techniques used, as well as their
applications to generative AI. We also discuss limitations and potential future
directions.

Title: Instruction Agent: Enhancing Agent with Expert Demonstration
Authors: Yinheng Li, Hailey Hultquist, Justin Wagle, Kazuhito Koishida
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Title: Neuro-Symbolic Frameworks: Conceptual Characterization and Empirical
  Comparative Analysis
Authors: Sania Sinha, Tanawan Premsri, Danial Kamali, Parisa Kordjamshidi
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.SC
\\
  Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

Title: Autoencoder-Based Denoising of Muscle Artifacts in ECG to Preserve Skin
  Nerve Activity (SKNA) for Cognitive Stress Detection
Authors: Farnoush Baghestani, Jihye Moon, Youngsun Kong, Ki Chon
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables
\\
  The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

Title: PaVeRL-SQL: Text-to-SQL via Partial-Match Rewards and Verbal
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Heng Hao, Wenjun Hu, Oxana Verkholyak, Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Baruch

\\
  Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at
https://github.com/PaVeRL-SQL/PaVeRL-SQL.

Title: That's So FETCH: Fashioning Ensemble Techniques for LLM Classification
  in Civil Legal Intake and Referral
Authors: Quinten Steenhuis
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.CY
Comments: Submission to JURIX 2025
\\
  Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

Title: A Hybrid CNN-LSTM Deep Learning Model for Intrusion Detection in Smart
  Grid
Authors: Abdulhakim Alsaiari and Mohammad Ilyas
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Title: BlendedNet: A Blended Wing Body Aircraft Dataset and Surrogate Model for
  Aerodynamic Predictions

\\
  BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

  Individuals with ambulatory disabilities often encounter significant barriers
when navigating urban environments due to the lack of accessible information
and tools. This paper presents OmniAcc, an AI-powered interactive navigation
system that utilizes GPT-4, satellite imagery, and OpenStreetMap data to
identify, classify, and map wheelchair-accessible features such as ramps and
crosswalks in the built environment. OmniAcc offers personalized route
planning, real-time hands-free navigation, and instant query responses
regarding physical accessibility. By using zero-shot learning and customized
prompts, the system ensures precise detection of accessibility features, while
supporting validation through structured workflows. This paper introduces
OmniAcc and explores its potential to assist urban planners and mobility-aid
users, demonstrated through a case study on crosswalk detection. With a
crosswalk detection accuracy of 97.5%, OmniAcc highlights the transformative

Title: HealthSLM-Bench: Benchmarking Small Language Models for Mobile and
  Wearable Healthcare Monitoring
Authors: Xin Wang, Ting Dang, Xinyu Zhang, Vassilis Kostakos, Michael J.

Categories: cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG
Comments: 9 pages, 6 tables, 6 figures
\\
  Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

Title: Performative Thinking? The Brittle Correlation Between CoT Length and
  Problem Complexity
Authors: Vardhan Palod, Karthik Valmeekam, Kaya Stechly, Subbarao Kambhampati
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

Title: Autonomous Code Evolution Meets NP-Completeness
Authors: Cunxi Yu and Rongjian Liang and Chia-Tung Ho and Haoxing Ren
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO
Comments: 31 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

Title: Language Self-Play For Data-Free Training
Authors: Jakub Grudzien Kuba, Mengting Gu, Qi Ma, Yuandong Tian, Vijai Mohan
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.GT
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

Title: SheetDesigner: MLLM-Powered Spreadsheet Layout Generation with
  Rule-Based and Vision-Based Reflection
Authors: Qin Chen, Yuanyi Ren, Xiaojun Ma, Mugeng Liu, Han Shi, and Dongmei

Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference
\\
  Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

Title: Towards explainable decision support using hybrid neural models for
  logistic terminal automation
Authors: Riccardo DElia, Alberto Termine and Francesco Flammini
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025
\\
  Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

  Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

Title: DeepGraphLog for Layered Neurosymbolic AI
Authors: Adem Kikaj and Giuseppe Marra and Floris Geerts and Robin Manhaeve and
  Luc De Raedt
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

Title: Unleashing the True Potential of LLMs: A Feedback-Triggered
  Self-Correction with Long-Term Multipath Decoding
Authors: Jipeng Li, Zeyu Gao, Yubin Qi, Hande Dong, Weijian Chen, Qiang Lin
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

Title: RIMO: An Easy-to-Evaluate, Hard-to-Solve Olympiad Benchmark for Advanced
  Mathematical Reasoning
Authors: Ziye Chen and Chengwei Qin and Yao Shu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

Title: BDPM: A Machine Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease
  Classification via Gut Microbiota Analysis
Authors: Bo Yu, Zhixiu Hua, Bo Zhao
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG q-bio.QM
Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

Title: The Carbon Footprint Wizard: A Knowledge-Augmented AI Interface for
  Streamlining Food Carbon Footprint Analysis
Authors: Mustafa Kaan Aslan and Reinout Heijungs and Filip Ilievski
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

Title: Certainty-Guided Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Dynamic Thinking
  Budget Approach
Authors: Jo\~ao Paulo Nogueira, Wentao Sun, Alonso Silva, Laith Zumot
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

Title: Aligning LLMs for the Classroom with Knowledge-Based Retrieval -- A
  Comparative RAG Study
Authors: Amay Jain, Liu Cui, and Si Chen
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication
\\
  Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

Title: SCoder: Iterative Self-Distillation for Bootstrapping Small-Scale Data
  Synthesizers to Empower Code LLMs
Authors: Xinyu Zhang and Changzhi Zhou and Linmei Hu and Luhao Zhang and
  Xiancai Chen and Haomin Fu and Yang Yang and Mengdi Zhang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

Title: CP-Model-Zoo: A Natural Language Query System for Constraint Programming
  Models
Authors: Augustin Crespin and Ioannis Kostis and H\'el\`ene Verhaeghe and

Categories: cs.AI
Comments: presented at"LLMs meet Constraint Solving" Workshop at CP2025 in
  Glasgow
\\
  Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

  Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

Title: Probing the Preferences of a Language Model: Integrating Verbal and
  Behavioral Tests of AI Welfare
Authors: Valen Tagliabue, Leonard Dung
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

  Large language models (LLMs) show increasing potential in education, yet
benchmarks for non-English languages in specialized domains remain scarce. We
introduce MedBench-IT, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
Italian medical university entrance examinations. Sourced from Edizioni Simone,
a leading preparatory materials publisher, MedBench-IT comprises 17,410
expert-written multiple-choice questions across six subjects (Biology,
Chemistry, Logic, General Culture, Mathematics, Physics) and three difficulty
levels. We evaluated diverse models including proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude
series) and resource-efficient open-source alternatives (<30B parameters)
focusing on practical deployability.
  Beyond accuracy, we conducted rigorous reproducibility tests (88.86% response
consistency, varying by subject), ordering bias analysis (minimal impact), and
reasoning prompt evaluation. We also examined correlations between question
readability and model performance, finding a statistically significant but
small inverse relationship. MedBench-IT provides a crucial resource for Italian
NLP community, EdTech developers, and practitioners, offering insights into
current capabilities and standardized evaluation methodology for this critical
domain.

Title: Toward Purpose-oriented Topic Model Evaluation enabled by Large Language
  Models
Authors: Zhiyin Tan, Jennifer D'Souza
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.DL
Comments: Accepted for publication in International Journal on Digital
  Libraries (IJDL)
\\
  This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting

  Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various domains. However, their general-purpose nature often limits their
effectiveness in specialized fields such as energy, where deep technical
expertise and precise domain knowledge are essential. In this paper, we
introduce EnergyGPT, a domain-specialized language model tailored for the

Fine-Tuning on a high-quality, curated corpus of energy-related texts. We
present a complete development pipeline, including data collection and
curation, model fine-tuning, benchmark design and LLM-judge choice, evaluation
and deployment. Through this work, we demonstrate that our training strategy
enables improvements in domain relevance and performance without the need for
large-scale infrastructure. By evaluating the performance of the model using
domain-specific question-answering benchmarks, our results demonstrate that
EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most of the energy-related language
understanding and generation tasks.

  Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

Title: Rule-Based Moral Principles for Explaining Uncertainty in Natural
  Language Generation

Comments: This paper was accepted for presentation at the 35th IEEE
  International Conference on Collaborative Advances in Software and Computing.
  Conference website:https://conf.researchr.org/home/cascon-2025
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

Title: LLM Analysis of 150+ years of German Parliamentary Debates on Migration
  Reveals Shift from Post-War Solidarity to Anti-Solidarity in the Last Decade
Authors: Aida Kostikova, Ole P\"utz, Steffen Eger, Olga Sabelfeld, Benjamin

\\
  Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

Title: Causal Attention with Lookahead Keys
Authors: Zhuoqing Song, Peng Sun, Huizhuo Yuan, Quanquan Gu
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

Title: Basis Vector Metric: A Method for Robust Open-Ended State Change
  Detection
Authors: David Oprea, Sam Powers
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 24 pages
\\
  We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

Title: Instance-level Performance Prediction for Long-form Generation Tasks
Authors: Chi-Yang Hsu, Alexander Braylan, Yiheng Su, Omar Alonso, Matthew Lease
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

Title: Does This Look Familiar to You? Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
  Representations
Authors: Sihyun Park
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

Title: Mitigating Attention Localization in Small Scale: Self-Attention
  Refinement via One-step Belief Propagation
Authors: Nakyung Lee, Yeongoon Kim, Minhae Oh, Suhwan Kim, Jin Woo Koo, Hyewon
  Jo, Jungwoo Lee
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Accepted at EMNLP 2025
\\
  Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

Title: PersonaFuse: A Personality Activation-Driven Framework for Enhancing
  Human-LLM Interactions
Authors: Yixuan Tang and Yi Yang and Ahmed Abbasi
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

Authors: Sankalp Tattwadarshi Swain, Anshika Krishnatray, Dhruv Kumar, Jagat

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG
Comments: Under review
\\
  Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

Title: The Role of Exploration Modules in Small Language Models for Knowledge
  Graph Question Answering
Authors: Yi-Jie Cheng, Oscar Chew, Yun-Nung Chen
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Extended from ACL 2025 SRW
\\
  Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

\\
  Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

  Positive, supportive online communication in social media (candy speech) has
the potential to foster civility, yet automated detection of such language
remains underexplored, limiting systematic analysis of its impact. We
investigate how candy speech can be reliably detected in a 46k-comment German
YouTube corpus by monolingual and multilingual language models, including
GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level
outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906)
and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the
GermEval 2025 Shared Task on Candy Speech Detection. We speculate that
span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers
improved detection performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
multilingual models in identifying positive, supportive language.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

Title: HALT-RAG: A Task-Adaptable Framework for Hallucination Detection with
  Calibrated NLI Ensembles and Abstention
Authors: Saumya Goswami, Siddharth Kurra
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,
and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities
enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for
balancing model performance with safety requirements.

Title: ALLabel: Three-stage Active Learning for LLM-based Entity Recognition
  using Demonstration Retrieval
Authors: Zihan Chen, Lei Shi, Weize Wu, Qiji Zhou, Yue Zhang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR
\\
  Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

  With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The

Title: Avoiding Knowledge Edit Skipping in Multi-hop Question Answering with
  Guided Decomposition
Authors: Yi Liu and Xiangrong Zhu and Xiangyu Liu and Wei Wei and Wei Hu
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Accepted in EMNLP Findings 2025
\\
  In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

  In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

Title: MaLei at MultiClinSUM: Summarisation of Clinical Documents using
  Perspective-Aware Iterative Self-Prompting with LLMs
Authors: Libo Ren, Yee Man Ng, Lifeng Han
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: system paper at CLEF 2025
\\
  Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at

Title: M-BRe: Discovering Training Samples for Relation Extraction from
  Unlabeled Texts with Large Language Models
Authors: Zexuan Li, Hongliang Dai, Piji Li
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted by EMNLP2025 Main Conference
\\
  For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

Title: Factuality Beyond Coherence: Evaluating LLM Watermarking Methods for
  Medical Texts
Authors: Rochana Prih Hastuti, Rian Adam Rajagede, Mansour Al Ghanim, Mengxin
  Zheng, Qian Lou
Categories: cs.CL cs.CR
Comments: Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Findings
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

Title: Are LLMs Enough for Hyperpartisan, Fake, Polarized and Harmful Content
  Detection? Evaluating In-Context Learning vs. Fine-Tuning
Authors: Michele Joshua Maggini, Dhia Merzougui, Rabiraj Bandyopadhyay, Ga\"el
  Dias, Fabrice Maurel, Pablo Gamallo
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the
importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even
when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup -
in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

Title: SciNLP: A Domain-Specific Benchmark for Full-Text Scientific Entity and
  Relation Extraction in NLP
Authors: Decheng Duan, Yingyi Zhang, Jitong Peng, Chengzhi Zhang
Categories: cs.CL cs.DL cs.IR
Comments: EMNLP 2025 Main
\\
  Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

Title: Dual Knowledge-Enhanced Two-Stage Reasoner for Multimodal Dialog Systems
Authors: Xiaolin Chen, Xuemeng Song, Haokun Wen, Weili Guan, Xiangyu Zhao,
  Liqiang Nie
Categories: cs.CL cs.MM
\\
  Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

Title: Small Open Models Achieve Near Parity with Large Models in Low Resource
  Literary Translation at a Fraction of the Cost
Authors: Mihai Nadas, Laura Diosan, Andreea Tomescu, Andrei Piscoran

\\
  Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

Title: Are Humans as Brittle as Large Language Models?
Authors: Jiahui Li, Sean Papay, Roman Klinger
Categories: cs.CL cs.HC
\\
  The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

Title: From Detection to Mitigation: Addressing Gender Bias in Chinese Texts
  via Efficient Tuning and Voting-Based Rebalancing
Authors: Chengyan Wu, Yiqiang Cai, Yufei Cheng, Yun Xue
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: NLPCC 2025
\\
  This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

Title: Biased Tales: Cultural and Topic Bias in Generating Children's Stories

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and
morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large
language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and
gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address
this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to
analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in
LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the
protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

  Uncertainty estimation is essential for enhancing the reliability of Large

up to 29% higher AUROC than semantic entropy-based approaches and reduces
calibration errors by over 15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Project website: https://zhengkid.github.io/Parallel_R1.github.io/
\\
  Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

  Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

  Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

Title: Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution
  Detection
Authors: Yingsheng Wang, Shuo Lu, Jian Liang, Aihua Zheng, Ran He
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Accepted to PRCV2025
\\
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

  Pretraining

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
ACM-class: I.2; I.4
\\
  Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

Title: FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models
Authors: Kun Zhai, Siheng Chen, Xingjun Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ACM MM25
\\
  Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Title: VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and
  Enterprise Reality
Authors: Srihari Bandraupalli, Anupam Purwar
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
\\
  Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

Title: The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM
  Headers
Authors: Jimmy Joseph
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

Title: Visible Yet Unreadable: A Systematic Blind Spot of Vision Language
  Models Across Writing Systems
Authors: Jie Zhang, Ting Xu, Gelei Deng, Runyi Hu, Han Qiu, Tianwei Zhang, Qing

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

Title: K-Syn: K-space Data Synthesis in Ultra Low-data Regimes
Authors: Guan Yu, Zhang Jianhua, Liang Dong, Liu Qiegen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

  Unrelated Categories

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

Title: Human-in-the-Loop: Quantitative Evaluation of 3D Models Generation by
  Large Language Models
Authors: Ahmed R. Sadik, Mariusz Bujny
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.ET
\\
  Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

Title: MEGS$^{2}$: Memory-Efficient Gaussian Splatting via Spherical Gaussians

Authors: Jiarui Chen, Yikeng Chen, Yingshuang Zou, Ye Huang, Peng Wang, Yuan

Comments: 14 pages, 4 figures
\\
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Title: Moment- and Power-Spectrum-Based Gaussianity Regularization for
  Text-to-Image Models
Authors: Jisung Hwang, Jaihoon Kim, Minhyuk Sung
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Submitted to NeurIPS 2025
\\
  We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

  Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

  This study tackles the challenge of efficiently classifying streaming data in
envi-ronments with limited memory and computational resources. It delves into
the application of data distillation as an innovative approach to improve the
precision of streaming image data classification. By focusing on distilling
essential features from data streams, our method aims to minimize computational
demands while preserving crucial information for accurate classification. Our
investigation com-pares this approach against traditional algorithms like
Hoeffding Trees and Adap-tive Random Forest, adapted through embeddings for
image data. The Distillation Based Classification (DBC) demonstrated superior
performance, achieving a 73.1% accuracy rate, surpassing both traditional
methods and Reservoir Sam-pling Based Classification (RBC) technique. This
marks a significant advance-ment in streaming data classification, showcasing
the effectiveness of our method in processing complex data streams and setting
a new standard for accuracy and efficiency.

Title: Automated Evaluation of Gender Bias Across 13 Large Multimodal Models
Authors: Juan Manuel Contreras
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CY
ACM-class: I.2.7; F.2.2
\\
  Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Project page at https://vision.rwth-aachen.de/sparse-vggt
\\
  Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  Visual-Inertial Odometry
Authors: Soruya Saha, Md Nurul Absurd, Saptarshi Debroy
Categories: cs.CV cs.MM
Comments: 12 Pages, 8 Figures
\\
  Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

Title: Realism to Deception: Investigating Deepfake Detectors Against Face
  Enhancement
Authors: Muhammad Saad Saeed, Ijaz Ul Haq, Khalid Malik
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 16 pages, 12 Figures, 12 Tables
\\
  Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

Title: XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal
  Vision-Language Learning
Authors: Raja Mallina and Bryar Shareef
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 15 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables
\\
  Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Comments: Accepted to IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and
  Health Informatics (BHI 2025)
\\
  Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

Title: Reconstruction Alignment Improves Unified Multimodal Models
Authors: Ji Xie and Trevor Darrell and Luke Zettlemoyer and XuDong Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 28 pages, 24 figures and 10 tables
\\
  Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

Title: G3CN: Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated Graph Convolutional Network for
  Skeleton-Based Action Recognition
Authors: Haiqing Ren, Zhongkai Luo, Heng Fan, Xiaohui Yuan, Guanchen Wang, Libo

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures, IROS
\\
  Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Title: Parse Graph-Based Visual-Language Interaction for Human Pose Estimation
Authors: Shibang Liu, Xuemei Xie and Guangming Shi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

  The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Title: In the Eye of MLLM: Benchmarking Egocentric Video Intent Understanding
  with Gaze-Guided Prompting
Authors: Taiying Peng, Jiacheng Hua, Miao Liu, Feng Lu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

  Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

  Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Title: Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning: Towards Fairer Vision Models via
  Controllable Forgetting

\\
  Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

\\
  Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

  Deep neural networks excel in radiological image classification but
frequently suffer from poor interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. We
present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image
regions. MedicalPatchNet splits images into non-overlapping patches,
independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks
associated with shortcut learning, thus improving clinical trust. Our model is
publicly available with reproducible training and inference scripts and
contributes to safer, explainable AI-assisted diagnostics across medical
imaging domains. We make the code publicly available:

Title: LINR Bridge: Vector Graphic Animation via Neural Implicits and Video

  Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Title: DiGS: Accurate and Complete Surface Reconstruction from 3D Gaussians via
  Direct SDF Learning
Authors: Wenzhi Guo, Bing Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.CG
\\
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Comments: Accepted at WACV 2026
\\
  Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

  Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

\\
  Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

  While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image

Title: TextlessRAG: End-to-End Visual Document RAG by Speech Without Text
Authors: Peijin Xie and Shun Qian and Bingquan Liu and Dexin Wang and Lin Sun
  and Xiangzheng Zhang

Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures,

  Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

Title: PanoLAM: Large Avatar Model for Gaussian Full-Head Synthesis from
  One-shot Unposed Image
Authors: Peng Li, Yisheng He, Yingdong Hu, Yuan Dong, Weihao Yuan, Yuan Liu,
  Zilong Dong, Yike Guo
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

  Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Title: Temporal Image Forensics: A Review and Critical Evaluation
Authors: Robert J\"ochl and Andreas Uhl
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

  Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Title: Data-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models for Diagnosis of
  Alzheimer's Disease
Authors: Fangqi Cheng, Surajit Ray, Xiaochen Yang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Title: Self-Supervised Cross-Encoder for Neurodegenerative Disease Diagnosis
Authors: Fangqi Cheng, Yingying Zhao, Xiaochen Yang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

\\
  Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Title: Beyond Motion Cues and Structural Sparsity: Revisiting Small Moving
  Target Detection
Authors: Guoyi Zhang, Siyang Chen, Guangsheng Xu, Zhihua Shen, Han Wang, and
  Xiaohu Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Title: EDFFDNet: Towards Accurate and Efficient Unsupervised Multi-Grid Image
  Registration
Authors: Haokai Zhu, Bo Qu, Si-Yuan Cao, Runmin Zhang, Shujie Chen, Bailin
  Yang, Hui-Liang Shen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

  Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

\\
  Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

Title: SEEC: Segmentation-Assisted Multi-Entropy Models for Learned Lossless
  Image Compression
Authors: Chunhang Zheng, Zichang Ren, Dou Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: under review
\\
  Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

  Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

  based on 3D Gaussian Splatting" published at BMVC 2025. Project website:
  https://yimin-pan.github.io/hair-gs/
\\
  Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

Comments: Project page with videos and code: https://raygaussx.github.io/
\\
  RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Title: Faster, Self-Supervised Super-Resolution for Anisotropic Multi-View MRI
  Using a Sparse Coordinate Loss
Authors: Maja Schlereth, Moritz Schillinger, Katharina Breininger
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 11 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

Title: SplatFill: 3D Scene Inpainting via Depth-Guided Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Mahtab Dahaghin, Milind G. Padalkar, Matteo Toso and Alessio Del Bue
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

Title: Point Linguist Model: Segment Any Object via Bridged Large 3D-Language
  Model
Authors: Zhuoxu Huang, Mingqi Gao, and Jungong Han
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Preprint
\\
  3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

Title: Deep Learning-Based Burned Area Mapping Using Bi-Temporal Siamese
  Networks and AlphaEarth Foundation Datasets
Authors: Seyd Teymoor Seydi
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Accurate and timely mapping of burned areas is crucial for environmental
monitoring, disaster management, and assessment of climate change. This study
presents a novel approach to automated burned area mapping using the AlphaEArth
dataset combined with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture. The
AlphaEArth Dataset, comprising high-resolution optical and thermal infrared
imagery with comprehensive ground-truth annotations, provides an unprecedented
resource for training robust burned area detection models. We trained our model
with the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) dataset in the contiguous US
and evaluated it with 17 regions cross in Europe. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance
with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test
dataset. The model successfully identifies burned areas across diverse
ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable
solution for global burn area monitoring using the AlphaEarth dataset.

Title: D-LEAF: Localizing and Correcting Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via
  Layer-to-head Attention Diagnostics
Authors: Tiancheng Yang, Lin Zhang, Jiaye Lin, Guimin Hu, Di Wang, Lijie Hu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

\\
  Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency
in AI models, facilitating stronger safeguards in AI deployments to achieve
proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

Title: Object-level Correlation for Few-Shot Segmentation

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: This paper was accepted by ICCV 2025
\\
  Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Title: ScoreHOI: Physically Plausible Reconstruction of Human-Object
  Interaction via Score-Guided Diffusion
Authors: Ao Li, Jinpeng Liu, Yixuan Zhu and Yansong Tang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by ICCV 2025
\\
  Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Title: Multimodal Contrastive Pretraining of CBCT and IOS for Enhanced Tooth
  Segmentation
Authors: Moo Hyun Son, Juyoung Bae, Zelin Qiu, Jiale Peng, Kai Xin Li, Yifan

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

Title: Accelerating Local AI on Consumer GPUs: A Hardware-Aware Dynamic
  Strategy for YOLOv10s
Authors: Mahmudul Islam Masum, Miad Islam, Arif I. Sarwat
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 6 pages, 7 figures
\\
  As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

  Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

\\
  One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

Title: Visual-TableQA: Open-Domain Benchmark for Reasoning over Table Images
Authors: Boammani Aser Lompo and Marc Haraoui
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
Comments: Work in Progress
\\
  Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full
pipeline and resources are publicly available at

Title: Mini-o3: Scaling Up Reasoning Patterns and Interaction Turns for Visual
  Search

\\
  Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

  Randomization for One-Shot 6D Pose Estimation

\\
  Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

\\
  We present Crossword, a flexible consensus protocol for dynamic data-heavy
workloads, a rising challenge in the cloud where replication payload sizes span
a wide spectrum and introduce sporadic bandwidth stress. Crossword applies
per-instance erasure coding and distributes coded shards intelligently to
reduce critical-path data transfer significantly when desirable. Unlike
previous approaches that statically assign shards to servers, Crossword enables
an adaptive tradeoff between the assignment of shards and quorum size in
reaction to dynamic workloads and network conditions, while always retaining
the availability guarantee of classic protocols. Crossword handles leader
failover gracefully by employing a lazy follower gossiping mechanism that
incurs minimal impact on critical-path performance. We implement Crossword
(along with relevant protocols) in Gazette, a distributed, replicated, and
protocol-generic key-value store written in async Rust. We evaluate Crossword
comprehensively to show that it matches the best performance among previous
protocols (MultiPaxos, Raft, RSPaxos, and CRaft) in static scenarios, and
outperforms them by up to 2.3x under dynamic workloads and network conditions.
Our integration of Crossword with CockroachDB brings 1.32x higher aggregate
throughput to TPC-C under 5-way replication. We will open-source Gazette upon
publication.

Authors: Guanzhou Hu, Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 12 pages, 16 figures, 1 table, contains appendix
\\
  We present Bodega, the first consensus protocol that serves linearizable
reads locally from any desired node, regardless of interfering writes. Bodega
achieves this via a novel roster leases algorithm that safeguards the roster, a
new notion of cluster metadata. The roster is a generalization of leadership;
it tracks arbitrary subsets of replicas as responder nodes for local reads. A
consistent agreement on the roster is established through roster leases, an
all-to-all leasing mechanism that generalizes existing all-to-one leasing
approaches (Leader Leases, Quorum Leases), unlocking a new point in the
protocol design space. Bodega further employs optimistic holding and early
accept notifications to minimize interruption from interfering writes, and
incorporates smart roster coverage and lightweight heartbeats to maximize
practicality. Bodega is a non-intrusive extension to classic consensus; it
imposes no special requirements on writes other than a responder-covering
quorum. We implement Bodega and related works in Vineyard, a protocol-generic
replicated key-value store written in async Rust. We compare it to previous
protocols (Leader Leases, EPaxos, PQR, and Quorum Leases) and two production
coordination services (etcd and ZooKeeper). Bodega speeds up average client
read requests by 5.6x-13.1x on real WAN clusters versus previous approaches
under moderate write interference, delivers comparable write performance,
supports fast proactive roster changes as well as fault tolerance via leases,
and closely matches the performance of sequentially-consistent etcd and
ZooKeeper deployments across all YCSB workloads. We will open-source Vineyard
upon publication.

  Memory-to-memory data streaming is essential for modern scientific workflows
that require near real-time data analysis, experimental steering, and informed
decision-making during experiment execution. It eliminates the latency
bottlenecks associated with file-based transfers to parallel storage, enabling
rapid data movement between experimental facilities and HPC systems. These
tightly coupled experimental-HPC workflows demand low latency, high throughput,
and reliable data delivery to support on-the-fly analysis and timely feedback
for experimental control. Off-the-shelf messaging frameworks are increasingly
considered viable solutions for enabling such direct memory streaming due to
their maturity, broad adoption, and ability to abstract core messaging and
reliability functionalities from the application layer. However, effectively
meeting the workflows' requirements depends on utilizing the framework's
capabilities and carefully tuning its configurations.
  In this paper, we present a study that investigates the messaging parameters,
and their configuration choices that impact the streaming requirements of two
representative scientific workflows. We specifically characterize throughput
trade-offs associated with reliable message transmission for these workflows.
Our study is conducted through streaming simulations using synthetic workloads
derived from the Deleria and LCLS workflows, employing the RabbitMQ messaging
framework within the context of the Data Streaming to HPC infrastructure at
OLCF. Our simulations reveal several key observations and practical insights
that help users understand which configurations best meet the needs of their
streaming workloads.

  The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to the development of
numerous applications that require quick responses and low latency. Fog
computing has emerged as a solution for processing these IoT applications, but
it faces challenges such as resource allocation and job scheduling. Therefore,
it is crucial to determine how to assign and schedule tasks on Fog nodes. A
well-designed job scheduling algorithm can help decrease energy usage and
improve response times for application requests. This work aims to schedule
tasks in IoT while minimizing the total energy consumption of nodes and
enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of IoT tasks, taking into
account task deadlines. Initially, this paper classifies the Fog nodes into two
categories based on their traffic level: low and high. It schedules
low-deadline tasks on low-traffic-level nodes using an Improved Golden Eagle
Optimization (IGEO) algorithm, an enhancement of the Golden Eagle Optimization
Algorithm that utilizes genetic operators for discretization. High-deadline
tasks are processed on high-traffic nodes using reinforcement learning (RL).
This combined approach is called the Reinforcement Improved Golden Eagle
Optimization (RIGEO) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms optimize system response time, total deadline violation
time, and resource and system energy consumption compared to other
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Title: DuoServe-MoE: Dual-Phase Expert Prefetch and Cache Scheduling for
  Efficient MoE LLM Inference
Authors: Yuning Zhang, Grant Pinkert, Nan Yang, Yanli Li, Dong Yuan
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
a wide range of deep learning tasks. Mixture of Experts (MoE) further enhances
their capabilities by increasing model width through sparsely activated expert
branches, which keeps inference computation efficient. However, the large
number of expert weights introduces significant GPU memory pressure, especially
in resource-constrained environments such as single-GPU servers. More
importantly, MoE inference consists of two fundamentally different stages: a
prefill stage where most experts are activated densely, and a decode stage
where only a few experts are triggered sparsely. Treating these stages with a
uniform scheduling strategy often leads to suboptimal latency and memory usage.
To address this, we propose DuoServe-MoE, an inference serving system that
explicitly separates prefill and decode stages and applies tailored expert
scheduling strategies to each. In the prefill stage, DuoServe-MoE uses a
two-stream CUDA pipeline that overlaps expert weight prefetching with the
computation of non-MoE layers, limiting expert residency in GPU memory. In the
decode stage, a lightweight layer-level predictor trained offline from
activation traces is used to prefetch only the most likely activated experts,
without requiring any changes to the model. Experiments on 4-bit Mixtral-8x7B
and 8x22B models show that DuoServe-MoE improves end-to-end latency by 1.42 to
7.54 times while keeping peak memory usage at only 15 percent of the full model
size.

Title: Dependency-Aware Execution Mechanism in Hyperledger Fabric Architecture
Authors: Sanyam Kaul and Manaswini Piduguralla and Gayathri Shreeya Patnala and
  Sathya Peri
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Hyperledger Fabric is a leading permissioned blockchain framework for
enterprise use, known for its modular design and privacy features. While it
strongly supports configurable consensus and access control, Fabric can face
challenges in achieving high transaction throughput and low rejection rates
under heavy workloads. These performance limitations are often attributed to
endorsement, ordering, and validation bottlenecks. Further, optimistic
concurrency control and deferred validation in Fabric may lead to resource
inefficiencies and contention, as conflicting transactions are identified only
during the commit phase. To address these challenges, we propose a
dependency-aware execution model for Hyperledger Fabric. Our approach includes:
(a) a dependency flagging system during endorsement, marking transactions as
independent or dependent using a hashmap; (b) an optimized block construction
in the ordering service that prioritizes independent transactions; (c) the
incorporation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) within each block to represent
dependencies; and (d) parallel execution of independent transactions at the
committer, with dependent transactions processed according to DAG order.
Incorporated in Hyperledger Fabric v2.5, our framework was tested on workloads
with varying dependency levels and system loads. Results show up to 40% higher
throughput and significantly reduced rejection rates in high-contention
scenarios. This demonstrates that dependency-aware scheduling and DAG-based
execution can substantially enhance Fabric's scalability while remaining
compatible with its existing consensus and smart contract layers.

Title: DREAMS: Decentralized Resource Allocation and Service Management across
  the Compute Continuum Using Service Affinity
Authors: Hai Dinh-Tuan, Tien Hung Nguyen, Sanjeet Raj Pandey
Categories: cs.DC cs.PF
\\
  Modern manufacturing systems require adaptive computing infrastructures that
can respond to highly dynamic workloads and increasingly customized production
demands. The compute continuum emerges as a promising solution, enabling
flexible deployment of microservices across distributed, heterogeneous domains.
However, this paradigm also requires a novel approach to resource allocation
and service placement, as traditional centralized solutions struggle to scale
effectively, suffer from latency bottlenecks, and introduce single points of
failure. In this paper, we present DREAMS, a decentralized framework that
optimizes microservice placement decisions collaboratively across different
computational domains. At its core, DREAMS introduces agents that operate
autonomously within each domain while coordinating globally through a
Raft-based consensus algorithm and cost-benefit voting. This decentralized
architecture enables responsive, privacy-preserving, and fault-tolerant
coordination, making it particularly suitable given the growing prevalence of
multi-stakeholder scenarios across the compute continuum. In particular, within
modern manufacturing environments, DREAMS achieves globally optimized service
placements while maintaining high fault tolerance. Further evaluations
demonstrate that key coordination operations, such as Local Domain Manager
(LDM) registration and migration voting, scale sub-linearly with the number of
domains, confirming the efficiency and scalability of our proposal.

Title: Astra: A Multi-Agent System for GPU Kernel Performance Optimization
Authors: Anjiang Wei, Tianran Sun, Yogesh Seenichamy, Hang Song, Anne Ouyang,
  Azalia Mirhoseini, Ke Wang, Alex Aiken
Categories: cs.DC cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG cs.SE
\\
  GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection
of high-performance computing and machine learning. Efficient kernels are
crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet
attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.
Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial
manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using
LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on
translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we
introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel
optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA
implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving
LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra,
specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing,
profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and
high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of
1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study
further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations,
optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast
math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights
multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel
optimization.

Title: Navigating Energy Doldrums: Modeling the Impact of Energy Price
  Volatility on HPC Cost of Ownership
Authors: Peter Arzt, Felix Wolf
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures, 1 table
\\
  Energy costs are a major factor in the total cost of ownership (TCO) for
high-performance computing (HPC) systems. The rise of intermittent green energy
sources and reduced reliance on fossil fuels have introduced volatility into
electricity markets, complicating energy budgeting. This paper explores
variable capacity as a strategy for managing HPC energy costs - dynamically
adjusting compute resources in response to fluctuating electricity prices.
While this approach can lower energy expenses, it risks underutilizing costly
hardware. To evaluate this trade-off, we present a simple model that helps
operators estimate the TCO impact of variable capacity strategies using key
system parameters. We apply this model to real data from a university HPC
cluster and assess how different scenarios could affect the cost-effectiveness
of this approach in the future.

  FaaS-hosted MCP Services
Authors: Shiva Sai Krishna Anand Tokal, Vaibhav Jha, Anand Eswaran, Praveen

Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has rapidly transformed various
fields including code generation, text summarization, image generation and so
on. Agentic AI is a recent evolution that further advances this by coupling the
decision making and generative capabilities of LLMs with actions that can be
performed using tools. While seemingly powerful, Agentic systems often struggle
when faced with numerous tools, complex multi-step tasks,and long-context
management to track history and avoid hallucinations. Workflow patterns such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReAct help address this. Here, we define a novel
agentic workflow pattern, AgentX, composed of stage designer, planner, and
executor agents that is competitive or better than the state-of-the-art agentic
patterns. We also leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, and propose two
alternative approaches for deploying MCP servers as cloud Functions as a
Service (FaaS). We empirically evaluate the success rate, latency and cost for
AgentX and two contemporary agentic patterns, ReAct and Magentic One, using
these the FaaS and local MCP server alternatives for three practical
applications. This highlights the opportunities and challenges of designing and
deploying agentic workflows.

Title: Scaling atomic ordering in shared memory
Authors: Lorenzo Martignetti, Eli\~a Batista, Gianpaolo Cugola, Fernando Pedone
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 21 pages, 16 figures
\\
  Atomic multicast is a communication primitive used in dependable systems to
ensure consistent ordering of messages delivered to a set of replica groups.
This primitive enables critical services to integrate replication and sharding
(i.e., state partitioning) to achieve fault tolerance and scalability. While
several atomic multicast protocols have been developed for message-passing
systems, only a few are designed for the shared memory system model. This paper
introduces TRAM, an atomic multicast protocol specifically designed for shared
memory systems, leveraging an overlay tree architecture. Due to its simple and
practical design, TRAM delivers exceptional performance, increasing throughput
by more than 3$\times$ and reducing latency by more than 2.3$\times$ compared
to state-of-the-art shared memory-based protocols. Additionally, it
significantly outperforms message-passing-based protocols, boosting throughput
by up to 5.9$\times$ and reducing latency by up to 106$\times$.

Title: Efficient Multi-Agent Coordination via Dynamic Joint-State Graph
  Construction
Authors: Yanlin Zhou, Manshi Limbu, Xuesu Xiao
Categories: cs.MA cs.RO
\\
  Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) traditionally focuses on collision avoidance,
but many real-world applications require active coordination between agents to
improve team performance. This paper introduces Team Coordination on Graphs
with Risky Edges (TCGRE), where agents collaborate to reduce traversal costs on
high-risk edges via support from teammates. We reformulate TCGRE as a 3D
matching problem-mapping robot pairs, support pairs, and time steps-and
rigorously prove its NP-hardness via reduction from Minimum 3D Matching. To
address this complexity, (in the conference version) we proposed efficient
decomposition methods, reducing the problem to tractable subproblems:
Joint-State Graph (JSG): Encodes coordination as a single-agent shortest-path
problem. Coordination-Exhaustive Search (CES): Optimizes support assignments
via exhaustive pairing. Receding-Horizon Optimistic Cooperative A* (RHOCA*):
Balances optimality and scalability via horizon-limited planning. Further in
this extension, we introduce a dynamic graph construction method
(Dynamic-HJSG), leveraging agent homogeneity to prune redundant states and
reduce computational overhead by constructing the joint-state graph
dynamically. Theoretical analysis shows Dynamic-HJSG preserves optimality while
lowering complexity from exponential to polynomial in key cases. Empirical
results validate scalability for large teams and graphs, with HJSG
outperforming baselines greatly in runtime in different sizes and types of
graphs. This work bridges combinatorial optimization and multi-agent planning,
offering a principled framework for collaborative pathfinding with provable
guarantees, and the key idea of the solution can be widely extended to many
other collaborative optimization problems, such as MAPF.

Title: Adaptive Evolutionary Framework for Safe, Efficient, and Cooperative
  Autonomous Vehicle Interactions
Authors: Zhen Tian and Zhihao Lin
Categories: cs.MA cs.RO
\\
  Modern transportation systems face significant challenges in ensuring road
safety, given serious injuries caused by road accidents. The rapid growth of
autonomous vehicles (AVs) has prompted new traffic designs that aim to optimize
interactions among AVs. However, effective interactions between AVs remains
challenging due to the absence of centralized control. Besides, there is a need
for balancing multiple factors, including passenger demands and overall traffic
efficiency. Traditional rule-based, optimization-based, and game-theoretic
approaches each have limitations in addressing these challenges. Rule-based
methods struggle with adaptability and generalization in complex scenarios,
while optimization-based methods often require high computational resources.
Game-theoretic approaches, such as Stackelberg and Nash games, suffer from
limited adaptability and potential inefficiencies in cooperative settings. This
paper proposes an Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)-based framework for AV
interactions that overcomes these limitations by utilizing a decentralized and
adaptive strategy evolution mechanism. A causal evaluation module (CEGT) is
introduced to optimize the evolutionary rate, balancing mutation and evolution
by learning from historical interactions. Simulation results demonstrate the
proposed CEGT outperforms EGT and popular benchmark games in terms of lower
collision rates, improved safety distances, higher speeds, and overall better
performance compared to Nash and Stackelberg games across diverse scenarios and
parameter settings.

Title: Bio-inspired decision making in swarms under biases from stubborn
  robots, corrupted communication, and independent discovery
Authors: Raina Zakir, Timoteo Carletti, Marco Dorigo, and Andreagiovanni Reina
Categories: cs.MA cs.RO
\\
  Minimalistic robot swarms offer a scalable, robust, and cost-effective
approach to performing complex tasks with the potential to transform
applications in healthcare, disaster response, and environmental monitoring.
However, coordinating such decentralised systems remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly when robots are constrained in communication,
computation, and memory. In our study, individual robots frequently make errors
when sensing the environment, yet the swarm can rapidly and reliably reach
consensus on the best among $n$ discrete options. We compare two canonical
mechanisms of opinion dynamics -- direct-switch and cross-inhibition -- which
are simple yet effective rules for collective information processing observed
in biological systems across scales, from neural populations to insect
colonies. We generalise the existing mean-field models by considering asocial
biases influencing the opinion dynamics. While swarms using direct-switch
reliably select the best option in absence of asocial dynamics, their
performance deteriorates once such biases are introduced, often resulting in
decision deadlocks. In contrast, bio-inspired cross-inhibition enables faster,
more cohesive, accurate, robust, and scalable decisions across a wide range of
biased conditions. Our findings provide theoretical and practical insights into
the coordination of minimal swarms and offer insights that extend to a broad
class of decentralised decision-making systems in biology and engineering.

Categories: cs.MA cs.AI
\\
  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific AI
agents has greatly expanded the ecosystem of AI-powered services. User queries,
however, are highly diverse and often span multiple domains and task types,
resulting in a complex and heterogeneous landscape. This diversity presents a
fundamental routing challenge: how to accurately direct each query to an
appropriate execution unit while optimizing both performance and efficiency. To
address this, we propose MoMA (Mixture of Models and Agents), a generalized
routing framework that integrates both LLM and agent-based routing. Built upon
a deep understanding of model and agent capabilities, MoMA effectively handles
diverse queries through precise intent recognition and adaptive routing
strategies, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and cost.
Specifically, we construct a detailed training dataset to profile the
capabilities of various LLMs under different routing model structures,
identifying the most suitable tasks for each LLM. During inference, queries are
dynamically routed to the LLM with the best cost-performance efficiency. We
also introduce an efficient agent selection strategy based on a context-aware
state machine and dynamic masking. Experimental results demonstrate that the
MoMA router offers superior cost-efficiency and scalability compared to
existing approaches.

Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table. tl;dr: Adversarial alignment of
  Time-Series Foundation Model (TSFM) embeddings enables transfer of
  high-quality clinical labels from medical-grade to consumer-grade wearables,
  enabling zero-shot prediction of gestational age without requiring paired

\\
  High-quality, medically validated labels exist for clinical actigraphy data
but not for ubiquitous consumer wearables like the Apple Watch. Manually
labeling wearables data is expensive and doesn't scale. This paper offers a
novel framework that transfers valuable labels from a source domain (e.g.,
actigraphy) to a target domain (e.g., Apple Watch) without requiring paired
data. Instead of working with raw time-series signals, we project both domains
into a shared latent embedding space using time-series foundation models
(TSFMs) and develop a new framework to align the cross-device representations.
Our method, Adversarial Alignment of TSFM Embeddings forces the distributions
of source and target embeddings to align within this space, facilitating label
transfer across device type.

Title: Cross-field SNR Analysis and Tensor Channel Estimation for Multi-UAV
  Near-field Communications
Authors: Tianyu Huo, Jian Xiong, Yiyan Wu, Songjie Yang, Bo Liu, Wenjun Zhang
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) is key to enhancing spectral efficiency
in 6G networks. Leveraging the distributed nature of multi-unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) systems enables the formation of distributed ELAA, which often
operate in the near-field region with spatial sparsity, rendering the
conventional far-field plane wave assumption invalid. This paper investigates
channel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems.
We first derive closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions under the
plane wave model (PWM), spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid
spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM), also referred to as the cross-field model,
within a distributed uniform planar array (UPA) scenario. The analysis shows
that HSPWM achieves a good balance between modeling accuracy and analytical
tractability. Based on this, we propose two channel estimation algorithms: the
spherical-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SD-OMP) and the tensor-OMP. The
SD-OMP generalizes the polar domain to jointly consider elevation, azimuth, and
range. Under the HSPWM, the channel is naturally formulated as a tensor,
enabling the use of tensor-OMP. Simulation results demonstrate that tensor-OMP
achieves normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance comparable to SD-OMP,
while offering reduced computational complexity and improved scalability.

  This article comprehensively reviews recent developments and research on deep
learning-based (DL-based) techniques for integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) systems. ISAC, which combines sensing and communication functionalities,
is regarded as a key enabler for 6G and beyond networks, as many emerging
applications, such as vehicular networks and industrial robotics, necessitate
both sensing and communication capabilities for effective operation. A unified
platform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate
frequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However,
integrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly
optimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant
computational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or
optimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques,
DL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced
computational complexity. Hence, such techniques are well-suited for operating
under limited computational resources and low latency requirements in real-time
systems. DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal
solutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including
waveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data
demodulation, and interference mitigation. Therefore, motivated by these
advantages, recent studies have proposed various DL-based approaches for ISAC
system design. After briefly introducing DL architectures and ISAC
fundamentals, this survey presents a comprehensive and categorized review of
state-of-the-art DL-based techniques for ISAC, highlights their key advantages
and major challenges, and outlines potential directions for future research.

  Physical activity is a modifiable lifestyle factor with potential to support
cognitive resilience. However, the association of moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) intensity, and timing, with cognitive function and
region-specific brain structure remain poorly understood. We analyzed data from
45,892 UK Biobank participants aged 60 years and older with valid wrist-worn
accelerometer data, cognitive testing, and structural brain MRI. MVPA was
measured both continuously (mins per week) and categorically (thresholded using
>=150 min/week based on WHO guidelines). Associations with cognitive
performance and regional brain volumes were evaluated using multivariable
linear models adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related
covariates. We conducted secondary analyses on MVPA timing and subgroup
effects. Higher MVPA was associated with better performance across cognitive
domains, including reasoning, memory, executive function, and processing speed.
These associations persisted in fully adjusted models and were higher among
participants meeting WHO guidelines. Greater MVPA was also associated with
subcortical brain regions (caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus), as well as
regional gray matter volumes involved in emotion, working memory, and
perceptual processing. Secondary analyses showed that MVPA at any time of day
was associated with cognitive functions and brain volume particularly in the
midday-afternoon and evening. Sensitivity analysis shows consistent findings
across subgroups, with evidence of dose-response relationships. Higher MVPA is
associated with preserved brain structure and enhanced cognitive function in
later life. Public health strategies to increase MVPA may support healthy
cognitive aging and generate substantial economic benefits, with global gains
projected to reach USD 760 billion annually by 2050.

Title: Impact of Neuron Models on Spiking Neural Networks performance. A
  Complexity Based Classification Approach
Authors: Zofia Rudnicka, Janusz Szczepanski, Agnieszka Pregowska
Categories: q-bio.NC cs.AI
\\
  This study explores how the selection of neuron models and learning rules
impacts the classification performance of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with
a focus on applications in bio-signal processing. We compare biologically
inspired neuron models, including Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), metaneurons,
and probabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neurons, across multiple learning rules,
including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), tempotron, and
reward-modulated updates. A novel element of this work is the integration of a
complexity-based decision mechanism into the evaluation pipeline. Using
Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), a measure related to entropy rate, we quantify the
structural regularity of spike trains and assess classification outcomes in a
consistent and interpretable manner across different SNN configurations. To
investigate neural dynamics and assess algorithm performance, we employed
synthetic datasets with varying temporal dependencies and stochasticity levels.
These included Markov and Poisson processes, well-established models to
simulate neuronal spike trains and capture the stochastic firing behavior of
biological neurons.Validation of synthetic Poisson and Markov-modeled data
reveals clear performance trends: classification accuracy depends on the
interaction between neuron model, network size, and learning rule, with the
LZC-based evaluation highlighting configurations that remain robust to weak or
noisy signals. This work delivers a systematic analysis of how neuron model
selection interacts with network parameters and learning strategies, supported
by a novel complexity-based evaluation approach that offers a consistent
benchmark for SNN performance.

Title: Individualized and Interpretable Sleep Forecasting via a Two-Stage
  Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Model
Authors: Xueyi Wang and Elisabeth Wilhelm
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction

also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

Title: GSTBench: A Benchmark Study on the Transferability of Graph
  Self-Supervised Learning
Authors: Yu Song, Zhigang Hua, Yan Xie, Jingzhe Liu, Bo Long, Hui Liu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Accepted at CIKM'25
\\
  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SongYYYY/GSTBench.

Title: A Knowledge-Guided Cross-Modal Feature Fusion Model for Local Traffic
  Demand Prediction
Authors: Lingyu Zhang, Pengfei Xu, Guobin Wu, Jian Liang, Ruiyang Dong, Yunhai

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

Title: Toward Reproducible Cross-Backend Compatibility for Deep Learning: A
  Configuration-First Framework with Three-Tier Verification
Authors: Zehua Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 7 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, appendix, code available at
  https://github.com/william-zehua-li/cross-backend-model-checker
\\
  This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,
and task-level metrics. Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance
settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,
providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across
heterogeneous runtimes.

Title: Exploring Over-stationarization in Deep Learning-based Bus/Tram Arrival
  Time Prediction: Analysis and Non-stationary Effect Recovery
Authors: Zirui Li, Bin Yang, Meng Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 26 pages, 13 figures
\\
  Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

  Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool
heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and
a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a
reward layer supporting rule-based, model-judgment, and tool-verification
signals. It reconstructs the MDP by introducing observation markers from tool
feedback, closing the loop among model, tools, and environment, and implements
a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow for dynamic policy optimization. On
Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, RLFactory achieves a 0.486 test score on the Natural
Questions (NQ) dataset, surpassing larger models trained with similar
techniques (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO at 0.473), and increases training
throughput by 6.8x. RLFactory provides a low-barrier, highly adaptable
framework for strengthening multi-round tool use of LLMs in real-world
scenarios. Code: https://github.com/Simple-Efficient/RL-Factory.

Title: CARE: Decoding Time Safety Alignment via Rollback and Introspection
  Intervention
Authors: Xiaomeng Hu, Fei Huang, Chenhan Yuan, Junyang Lin, Tsung-Yi Ho
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

  Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

\\
  This paper introduces ArGen (Auto-Regulation of Generative AI systems), a
framework for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with complex sets of
configurable, machine-readable rules spanning ethical principles, operational
safety protocols, and regulatory compliance standards. Moving beyond just
preference-based alignment, ArGen is designed to ensure LLMs adhere to these
multifaceted policies through a novel synthesis of principle-based automated
reward scoring, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), and an Open Policy
Agent (OPA) inspired governance layer. This approach provides the technical
foundation for achieving and demonstrating compliance with diverse and nuanced
governance requirements. To showcase the framework's capability to
operationalize a deeply nuanced and culturally-specific value system, we
present an in-depth case study: the development of a medical AI assistant
guided by principles from Dharmic ethics (such as Ahimsa and Dharma), as
derived from texts like the Bhagavad Gita. This challenging application
demonstrates ArGen's adaptability, achieving a 70.9% improvement in
domain-scope adherence over the baseline. Through our open-source repository,
we show that ArGen's methodology offers a path to 'Governable Al' systems that
are technically proficient, ethically robust, and verifiably compliant for safe
deployment in diverse global contexts.

  The article provides an overview of approaches to modeling the human psyche
in the perspective of building an artificial one. Based on the review, a
concept of cognitive architecture is proposed, where the psyche is considered
as an operating system of a living or artificial subject, including a space of
needs that determines its life meanings in connection with stimuli from the
external world, and intelligence as a decision-making system for actions in
relation to this world in order to satisfy these needs. Based on the concept, a
computational formalization is proposed for creating artificial intelligence
systems through learning from experience in the space of a space of needs,
taking into account their biological or existential significance for an
intelligent agent. Thus, the problem of building general artificial
intelligence as a system for making optimal decisions in the space of
agent-specific needs under conditions of uncertainty is formalized, with
maximization of success in achieving goals, minimization of existential risks
and maximization of energy efficiency. A minimal experimental implementation of
the model is also provided.

  In response to the prevalent concern of TCP SYN flood attacks within the
context of Software-Defined Internet of Vehicles (SD-IoV), this study addresses
the significant challenge of network security in rapidly evolving vehicular
communication systems. This research focuses on optimizing a Random Forest
Classifier model to achieve maximum accuracy and minimal detection time,
thereby enhancing vehicular network security. The methodology involves
preprocessing a dataset containing SYN attack instances, employing feature
scaling and label encoding techniques, and applying Stratified K-Fold
cross-validation to target key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and
F1-score. This research achieved an average value of 0.999998 for all metrics
with a SYN DoS attack detection time of 0.24 seconds. Results show that the
fine-tuned Random Forest model, configured with 20 estimators and a depth of
10, effectively differentiates between normal and malicious traffic with high
accuracy and minimal detection time, which is crucial for SD-IoV networks. This
approach marks a significant advancement and introduces a state-of-the-art
algorithm in detecting SYN flood attacks, combining high accuracy with minimal
detection time. It contributes to vehicular network security by providing a
robust solution against TCP SYN flood attacks while maintaining network
efficiency and reliability.

Title: An efficient deep reinforcement learning environment for flexible
  job-shop scheduling
Authors: Xinquan Wu, Xuefeng Yan, Mingqiang Wei, Donghai Guan
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

Comments: 7 pages content, 1 page reference, 1 figure, Accepted at AAAI Fall
  Symposium Series
\\
  In 2023, the National Eating Disorders Association's (NEDA) chatbot Tessa was
suspended after providing harmful weight-loss advice to vulnerable users-an
avoidable failure that underscores the risks of unsafe AI in healthcare
contexts. This paper examines Tessa as a case study in absent safety
engineering and demonstrates how a lightweight, modular safeguard could have
prevented the incident. We propose a hybrid safety middleware that combines
deterministic lexical gates with an in-line large language model (LLM) policy
filter, enforcing fail-closed verdicts and escalation pathways within a single
model call. Using synthetic evaluations, we show that this design achieves
perfect interception of unsafe prompts at baseline cost and latency,
outperforming traditional multi-stage pipelines. Beyond technical remedies, we
map Tessa's failure patterns to established frameworks (OWASP LLM Top10, NIST
SP 800-53), connecting practical safeguards to actionable governance controls.
The results highlight that robust, auditable safety in health-adjacent AI does
not require heavyweight infrastructure: explicit, testable checks at the last
mile are sufficient to prevent "another Tessa", while governance and escalation
ensure sustainability in real-world deployment.

Comments: 14 pages; 2 figures; 5 tables; 8 algorithms

\\
  The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

Title: Contradictions

Categories: cs.LO cs.AI
Comments: 37 Pages,9 figures
\\
  Trustworthy AI requires reasoning systems that are not only powerful but also
transparent and reliable. Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is central to formal
reasoning, yet classical binary resolution remains limited, as each step
involves only two clauses and eliminates at most two literals. To overcome this
bottleneck, the concept of standard contradiction and the theory of
contradiction-separation-based deduction were introduced in 2018. This paper
advances that framework by focusing on the systematic construction of standard
contradictions. Specially, this study investigates construction methods for two
principal forms of standard contradiction: the maximum triangular standard
contradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. Building on these
structures, we propose a procedure for determining the satisfiability and
unsatisfiability of clause sets via maximum standard contradiction.
Furthermore, we derive formulas for computing the number of standard
sub-contradictions embedded within both the maximum triangular standard
contradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. The results
presented herein furnish the methodological basis for advancing
contradiction-separation-based dynamic multi-clause automated deduction,
thereby extending the expressive and deductive capabilities of automated
reasoning systems beyond the classical binary paradigm.

\\
  The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the domains of
traditional art (visual arts, performing arts, and crafts) has sparked a
complicated discussion about whether this might be an agent of disruption or an
enhancement of our traditional art forms. This paper looks at the duality of
AI, exploring the ways that recent technologies like Generative Adversarial
Networks and Diffusion Models, and text-to-image generators are changing the
fields of painting, sculpture, calligraphy, dance, music, and the arts of
craft. Using examples and data, we illustrate the ways that AI can democratize
creative expression, improve productivity, and preserve cultural heritage,
while also examining the negative aspects, including: the threats to
authenticity within art, ethical concerns around data, and issues including
socio-economic factors such as job losses. While we argue for the
context-dependence of the impact of AI (the potential for creative
homogenization and the devaluation of human agency in artmaking), we also
illustrate the potential for hybrid practices featuring AI in cuisine, etc. We
advocate for the development of ethical guidelines, collaborative approaches,
and inclusive technology development. In sum, we are articulating a vision of
AI in which it amplifies our innate creativity while resisting the displacement
of the cultural, nuanced, and emotional aspects of traditional art. The future
will be determined by human choices about how to govern AI so that it becomes a
mechanism for artistic evolution and not a substitute for the artist's soul.

Title: A Minimalist Bayesian Framework for Stochastic Optimization
Authors: Kaizheng Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 25 pages
\\
  The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

Title: A Maslow-Inspired Hierarchy of Engagement with AI Model
Authors: Madara Ogot
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
Comments: 30 pages, 14 tables
\\
  The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) across industry,
government, and education highlights the urgent need for robust frameworks to
conceptualise and guide engagement. This paper introduces the Hierarchy of
Engagement with AI model, a novel maturity framework inspired by Maslow's
hierarchy of needs. The model conceptualises AI adoption as a progression
through eight levels, beginning with initial exposure and basic understanding
and culminating in ecosystem collaboration and societal impact. Each level
integrates technical, organisational, and ethical dimensions, emphasising that
AI maturity is not only a matter of infrastructure and capability but also of
trust, governance, and responsibility. Initial validation of the model using
four diverse case studies (General Motors, the Government of Estonia, the
University of Texas System, and the African Union AI Strategy) demonstrate the
model's contextual flexibility across various sectors. The model provides
scholars with a framework for analysing AI maturity and offers practitioners
and policymakers a diagnostic and strategic planning tool to guide responsible
and sustainable AI engagement. The proposed model demonstrates that AI maturity
progression is multi-dimensional, requiring technological capability, ethical
integrity, organisational resilience, and ecosystem collaboration.

Title: Methodological Insights into Structural Causal Modelling and
  Uncertainty-Aware Forecasting for Economic Indicators
Authors: Federico Cerutti
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Accepted at the 2nd edition of the Workshop in AI and Finance at
  ECAI-2025
\\
  This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

Title: Controllable Singing Voice Synthesis using Phoneme-Level Energy Sequence
Authors: Yerin Ryu, Inseop Shin, Chanwoo Kim
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI eess.AS
Comments: Accepted to ASRU 2025
\\
  Controllable Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive
singing voices reflecting user intent. While recent SVS systems achieve high
audio quality, most rely on probabilistic modeling, limiting precise control
over attributes such as dynamics. We address this by focusing on dynamic
control--temporal loudness variation essential for musical expressiveness--and
explicitly condition the SVS model on energy sequences extracted from
ground-truth spectrograms, reducing annotation costs and improving
controllability. We also propose a phoneme-level energy sequence for
user-friendly control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
enabling user-driven dynamics control in SVS. Experiments show our method
achieves over 50% reduction in mean absolute error of energy sequences for
phoneme-level inputs compared to baseline and energy-predictor models, without
compromising synthesis quality.

Title: Lookup multivariate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
Authors: Sergey Pozdnyakov and Philippe Schwaller
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.PF cs.SE
\\
  High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA
kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.

Title: Riemannian Batch Normalization: A Gyro Approach
Authors: Ziheng Chen and Xiao-Jun Wu and Nicu Sebe
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at
https://github.com/GitZH-Chen/GyroBN.git.

Categories: cs.GR cs.AI cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at 23rd edition of International Conference on Image
  Analysis and Processing 2025
\\
  Generated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images demand evaluation criteria
tuned to their symbolic and vectorial nature: criteria that existing metrics
such as FID, LPIPS, or CLIPScore fail to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce
SVGauge, the first human-aligned, reference based metric for text-to-SVG
generation. SVGauge jointly measures (i) visual fidelity, obtained by
extracting SigLIP image embeddings and refining them with PCA and whitening for
domain alignment, and (ii) semantic consistency, captured by comparing
BLIP-2-generated captions of the SVGs against the original prompts in the
combined space of SBERT and TF-IDF. Evaluation on the proposed SHE benchmark
shows that SVGauge attains the highest correlation with human judgments and
reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators more
faithfully than existing metrics. Our results highlight the necessity of
vector-specific evaluation and provide a practical tool for benchmarking future
text-to-SVG generation models.

Comments: This work has been accepted to the 7th International Conference on
  Blockchain Computing and Applications (BCCA 2025)
\\
  Blockchain and smart contracts have garnered significant interest in recent
years as the foundation of a decentralized, trustless digital ecosystem,
thereby eliminating the need for traditional centralized authorities. Despite
their central role in powering Web3, their complexity still presents
significant barriers for non-expert users. To bridge this gap, Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based agents have emerged as valuable tools for interacting
with blockchain environments, supporting a range of tasks, from analyzing
on-chain data and optimizing transaction strategies to detecting
vulnerabilities within smart contracts. While interest in applying AI to
blockchain is growing, the literature still lacks a comprehensive survey that
focuses specifically on the intersection with AI agents. Most of the related
work only provides general considerations, without focusing on any specific
domain. This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first Systematization
of Knowledge dedicated to AI-driven systems for blockchain, with a special
focus on their security and privacy dimensions, shedding light on their
applications, limitations, and future research directions.

Title: Adversarial Attacks on Audio Deepfake Detection: A Benchmark and
  Comparative Study
Authors: Kutub Uddin, Muhammad Umar Farooq, Awais Khan, Khalid Mahmood Malik
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  The widespread use of generative AI has shown remarkable success in producing
highly realistic deepfakes, posing a serious threat to various voice biometric
applications, including speaker verification, voice biometrics, audio
conferencing, and criminal investigations. To counteract this, several
state-of-the-art (SoTA) audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been
proposed to identify generative AI signatures to distinguish between real and
deepfake audio. However, the effectiveness of these methods is severely
undermined by anti-forensic (AF) attacks that conceal generative signatures.
These AF attacks span a wide range of techniques, including statistical
modifications (e.g., pitch shifting, filtering, noise addition, and
quantization) and optimization-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C \& W, and
DeepFool). In this paper, we investigate the SoTA ADD methods and provide a
comparative analysis to highlight their effectiveness in exposing deepfake
signatures, as well as their vulnerabilities under adversarial conditions. We
conducted an extensive evaluation of ADD methods on five deepfake benchmark
datasets using two categories: raw and spectrogram-based approaches. This
comparative analysis enables a deeper understanding of the strengths and
limitations of SoTA ADD methods against diverse AF attacks. It does not only
highlight vulnerabilities of ADD methods, but also informs the design of more
robust and generalized detectors for real-world voice biometrics. It will
further guide future research in developing adaptive defense strategies that
can effectively counter evolving AF techniques.

Title: Measuring Uncertainty in Transformer Circuits with Effective Information
  Consistency
Authors: Anatoly A. Krasnovsky
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

  This retrospective-prospective study evaluated whether a deep learning-based
MRI reconstruction algorithm can preserve diagnostic quality in brain MRI scans
accelerated up to fourfold, using both public and prospective clinical data.
The study included 18 healthy volunteers (scans acquired at 3T, January
2024-March 2025), as well as selected fastMRI public datasets with diverse
pathologies. Phase-encoding-undersampled 2D/3D T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences were
reconstructed with DeepFoqus-Accelerate and compared with standard-of-care
(SOC). Three board-certified neuroradiologists and two MRI technologists
independently reviewed 36 paired SOC/AI reconstructions from both datasets
using a 5-point Likert scale, while quantitative similarity was assessed for
408 scans and 1224 datasets using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Haar wavelet-based Perceptual Similarity
Index (HaarPSI). No AI-reconstructed scan scored below 3 (minimally
acceptable), and 95% scored $\geq 4$. Mean SSIM was 0.95 $\pm$ 0.03 (90% cases
>0.90), PSNR >41.0 dB, and HaarPSI >0.94. Inter-rater agreement was slight to
moderate. Rare artifacts did not affect diagnostic interpretation. These
findings demonstrate that DeepFoqus-Accelerate enables robust fourfold brain
MRI acceleration with 75% reduced scan time, while preserving diagnostic image
quality and supporting improved workflow efficiency.

  Aiming at the shortcomings of the gazelle optimization algorithm, such as the
imbalance between exploration and exploitation and the insufficient information
exchange within the population, this paper proposes a multi-strategy improved
gazelle optimization algorithm (MSIGOA). To address these issues, MSIGOA
proposes an iteration-based updating framework that switches between
exploitation and exploration according to the optimization process, which
effectively enhances the balance between local exploitation and global
exploration in the optimization process and improves the convergence speed. Two
adaptive parameter tuning strategies improve the applicability of the algorithm
and promote a smoother optimization process. The dominant population-based
restart strategy enhances the algorithms ability to escape from local optima
and avoid its premature convergence. These enhancements significantly improve
the exploration and exploitation capabilities of MSIGOA, bringing superior
convergence and efficiency in dealing with complex problems. In this paper, the
parameter sensitivity, strategy effectiveness, convergence and stability of the
proposed method are evaluated on two benchmark test sets including CEC2017 and
CEC2022. Test results and statistical tests show that MSIGOA outperforms basic
GOA and other advanced algorithms. On the CEC2017 and CEC2022 test sets, the
proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than GOA is 92.2% and 83.3%,
respectively, and the proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than
other algorithms is 88.57% and 87.5%, respectively. Finally, the extensibility
of MSIGAO is further verified by several engineering design optimization
problems.

Title: Explaining How Quantization Disparately Skews a Model
Authors: Abhimanyu Bellam and Jung-Eun Kim
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY
\\
  Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

Title: A transformer-based generative model for planetary systems
Authors: Yann Alibert, Jeanne Davoult and Sara Marques
Categories: astro-ph.EP astro-ph.IM cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Accepted in A&A
\\
  Numerical calculations of planetary system formation are very demanding in
terms of computing power. These synthetic planetary systems can however provide
access to correlations, as predicted in a given numerical framework, between
the properties of planets in the same system. Such correlations can, in return,
be used in order to guide and prioritize observational campaigns aiming at
discovering some types of planets, as Earth-like planets. Our goal is to
develop a generative model which is capable of capturing correlations and
statistical relationships between planets in the same system. Such a model,
trained on the Bern model, offers the possibility to generate large number of
synthetic planetary systems with little computational cost, that can be used,
for example, to guide observational campaigns. Our generative model is based on
the transformer architecture which is well-known to efficiently capture
correlations in sequences and is at the basis of all modern Large Language
Models. To assess the validity of the generative model, we perform visual and
statistical comparisons, as well as a machine learning driven tests. Finally,
as a use case example, we consider the TOI-469 system, in which we aim at
predicting the possible properties of planets c and d, based on the properties
of planet b (the first that has been detected). We show using different
comparison methods that the properties of systems generated by our model are
very similar to the ones of the systems computed directly by the Bern model. We
also show in the case of the TOI-469 system, that using the generative model
allows to predict the properties of planets not yet observed, based on the
properties of the already observed planet. We provide our model to the
community on our website www.ai4exoplanets.com.

\\
  Gradient-based neural network training traditionally enforces symmetry
between forward and backward propagation, requiring activation functions to be
differentiable (or sub-differentiable) and strictly monotonic in certain
regions to prevent flat gradient areas. This symmetry, linking forward
activations closely to backward gradients, significantly restricts the
selection of activation functions, particularly excluding those with
substantial flat or non-differentiable regions. In this paper, we challenge
this assumption through mathematical analysis, demonstrating that precise
gradient magnitudes derived from activation functions are largely redundant,
provided the gradient direction is preserved. Empirical experiments conducted
on foundational architectures - such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs),
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) -
confirm that relaxing forward-backward symmetry and substituting traditional
gradients with simpler or stochastic alternatives does not impair learning and
may even enhance training stability and efficiency. We explicitly demonstrate
that neural networks with flat or non-differentiable activation functions, such
as the Heaviside step function, can be effectively trained, thereby expanding
design flexibility and computational efficiency. Further empirical validation
with more complex architectures remains a valuable direction for future
research.

  This paper presents a practical investigation into fine-tuning model
parameters for mathematical reasoning tasks through experimenting with various
configurations including randomness control, reasoning depth, and sampling
strategies, careful tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency
as well as performance. A holistically optimized framework is introduced for
five state-of-the-art models on mathematical reasoning tasks, exhibiting
significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through
systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are
demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an
average 29.4% reduction in computational cost and 23.9% improvement in
inference speed across all tested models. This framework systematically
searches parameter spaces including temperature (0.1-0.5), reasoning steps
(4-12), planning periods (1-4), and nucleus sampling (0.85-0.98), determining
optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced
reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising
accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B
delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate
response. Key contributions include: (1) the first comprehensive optimization
study for five diverse SOTA models in mathematical reasoning, (2) a
standardized production-oriented parameter optimization framework, (3)
discovery of universal optimization trends applicable across model
architectures, and (4) production-ready configurations with extensive

Title: Benchmarking Information Retrieval Models on Complex Retrieval Tasks
Authors: Julian Killingback, Hamed Zamani
Categories: cs.IR cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are incredible and versatile tools for
text-based tasks that have enabled countless, previously unimaginable,
applications. Retrieval models, in contrast, have not yet seen such capable
general-purpose models emerge. To achieve this goal, retrieval models must be
able to perform complex retrieval tasks, where queries contain multiple parts,
constraints, or requirements in natural language. These tasks represent a
natural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the
vast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries
naturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and
often ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use
LLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models
to expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited
resources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of
diverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope
and often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities
of retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this
shortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we
construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark
a representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we
explore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval
quality. Our results show that even the best models struggle to produce
high-quality retrieval results with the highest average nDCG@10 of only 0.346
and R@100 of only 0.587 across all tasks. Although LLM augmentation can help
weaker models, the strongest model has decreased performance across all metrics
with all rewriting techniques.

  Personalized AI systems, from recommendation systems to chatbots, are a
prevalent method for distributing content to users based on their learned
preferences. However, there is growing concern about the adverse effects of
these systems, including their potential tendency to expose users to sensitive
or harmful material, negatively impacting overall well-being. To address this
concern quantitatively, it is necessary to create datasets with relevant
sensitivity labels for content, enabling researchers to evaluate personalized
systems beyond mere engagement metrics. To this end, we introduce two novel
datasets that include a taxonomy of sensitivity labels alongside user-content
ratings: one that integrates MovieLens rating data with content warnings from
the Does the Dog Die? community ratings website, and another that combines
fan-fiction interaction data and user-generated warnings from Archive of Our

  Substitution Ciphers

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL cs.CR
Comments: Preprint. Project page at https://jshen.net/alice
\\
  We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Title: Paladin: Defending LLM-enabled Phishing Emails with a New Trigger-Tag
  Paradigm
Authors: Yan Pang, Wenlong Meng, Xiaojing Liao, Tianhao Wang
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
Comments: 20 pages
\\
  With the rapid development of large language models, the potential threat of
their malicious use, particularly in generating phishing content, is becoming
increasingly prevalent. Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, malicious users
can synthesize phishing emails that are free from spelling mistakes and other
easily detectable features. Furthermore, such models can generate
topic-specific phishing messages, tailoring content to the target domain and
increasing the likelihood of success.
  Detecting such content remains a significant challenge, as LLM-generated
phishing emails often lack clear or distinguishable linguistic features. As a
result, most existing semantic-level detection approaches struggle to identify
them reliably. While certain LLM-based detection methods have shown promise,
they suffer from high computational costs and are constrained by the
performance of the underlying language model, making them impractical for
large-scale deployment.
  In this work, we aim to address this issue. We propose Paladin, which embeds
trigger-tag associations into vanilla LLM using various insertion strategies,
creating them into instrumented LLMs. When an instrumented LLM generates
content related to phishing, it will automatically include detectable tags,
enabling easier identification. Based on the design on implicit and explicit
triggers and tags, we consider four distinct scenarios in our work. We evaluate
our method from three key perspectives: stealthiness, effectiveness, and
robustness, and compare it with existing baseline methods. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms the baselines, achieving over 90% detection
accuracy across all scenarios.

  First, we propose a general computational model that employs a {\em
bit-masking} technique to enable the {\em selectivity} of existing
zero-knowledge proofs of training for gradient descent algorithms. This
innovation enables not only traditional {\em sample-level} unlearning but also
more advanced {\em feature-level} and {\em class-level} unlearning. Our model
can be translated to arithmetic circuits, ensuring compatibility with a broad
range of zero-knowledge proof systems. Furthermore, our approach overcomes key
limitations of existing methods in both efficiency and privacy. Second, forging
attacks present a serious threat to the reliability of unlearning.
Specifically, in Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization, gradients from
unlearned data, or from minibatches containing it, can be forged using
alternative data samples or minibatches that exclude it. We propose the first
effective strategies to resist state-of-the-art forging attacks. Finally, we
benchmark a zkSNARK-based instantiation of our framework and perform
comprehensive performance evaluations to validate its practicality.

Title: MEGG: Replay via Maximally Extreme GGscore in Incremental Learning for
  Neural Recommendation Models
Authors: Yunxiao Shi, Shuo Yang, Haimin Zhang, Li Wang, Yongze Wang, Qiang Wu,

  Neural Collaborative Filtering models are widely used in recommender systems
but are typically trained under static settings, assuming fixed data
distributions. This limits their applicability in dynamic environments where
user preferences evolve. Incremental learning offers a promising solution, yet
conventional methods from computer vision or NLP face challenges in
recommendation tasks due to data sparsity and distinct task paradigms. Existing
approaches for neural recommenders remain limited and often lack
generalizability. To address this, we propose MEGG, Replay Samples with
Maximally Extreme GGscore, an experience replay based incremental learning
framework. MEGG introduces GGscore, a novel metric that quantifies sample
influence, enabling the selective replay of highly influential samples to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Being model-agnostic, MEGG integrates
seamlessly across architectures and frameworks. Experiments on three neural
models and four benchmark datasets show superior performance over
state-of-the-art baselines, with strong scalability, efficiency, and
robustness. Implementation will be released publicly upon acceptance.

Title: General Demographic Foundation Models for Enhancing Predictive
  Performance Across Diseases
Authors: Li-Chin Chen, Ji-Tian Sheu, Yuh-Jue Chuang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

\\
  Spiking neural networks offer a promising path toward energy-efficient,
brain-like associative memory. This paper introduces Word2Spike, a novel rate
coding mechanism that combines continuous word embeddings and neuromorphic
architectures. We develop a one-to-one mapping that converts multi-dimensional
word vectors into spike-based attractor states using Poisson processes. Using
BitNet b1.58 quantization, we maintain 97% semantic similarity of continuous
embeddings on SimLex-999 while achieving 100% reconstruction accuracy on 10,000
words from OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large. We preserve analogy performance
(100% of original embedding performance) even under intentionally introduced
noise, indicating a resilient mechanism for semantic encoding in neuromorphic
systems. Next steps include integrating the mapping with spiking transformers
and liquid state machines (resembling Hopfield Networks) for further
evaluation.

Title: SBS: Enhancing Parameter-Efficiency of Neural Representations for Neural
  Networks via Spectral Bias Suppression
Authors: Qihu Xie, Yuan Li, and Yi Kang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Accepted by ICONIP 2025
\\
  Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

\\
  The relentless growth of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) has created
unprecedented demand for computational power, straining the energy, bandwidth,
and scaling limits of conventional electronic platforms. Electronic-photonic
integrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for
next-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high
bandwidth, low latency, and energy efficiency for computing and
interconnection. Beyond performance, EPICs also hold unique promises for
sustainability. Fabricated in relaxed process nodes with fewer metal layers and
lower defect densities, photonic devices naturally reduce embodied carbon
footprint (CFP) compared to advanced digital electronic integrated circuits,
while delivering orders-of-magnitude higher computing performance and
interconnect bandwidth. To further advance the sustainability of photonic AI
systems, we explore how electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and
cross-layer co-design methodologies can amplify these inherent benefits. We
present how advanced EPDA tools enable more compact layout generation, reducing
both chip area and metal layer usage. We will also demonstrate how cross-layer
device-circuit-architecture co-design unlocks new sustainability gains for
photonic hardware: ultra-compact photonic circuit designs that minimize chip
area cost, reconfigurable hardware topology that adapts to evolving AI
workloads, and intelligent resilience mechanisms that prolong lifetime by
tolerating variations and faults. By uniting intrinsic photonic efficiency with
EPDA- and co-design-driven gains in area efficiency, reconfigurability, and
robustness, we outline a vision for lifelong-sustainable electronic-photonic AI
systems. This perspective highlights how EPIC AI systems can simultaneously
meet the performance demands of modern AI and the urgent imperative for
sustainable computing.

Title: Benchmarking Universal Interatomic Potentials on Zeolite Structures
Authors: Shusuke Ito, Koki Muraoka, and Akira Nakayama
Categories: cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.AI physics.chem-ph
Comments: 26 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Interatomic potentials (IPs) with wide elemental coverage and high accuracy
are powerful tools for high-throughput materials discovery. While the past few
years witnessed the development of multiple new universal IPs that cover wide
ranges of the periodic table, their applicability to target chemical systems
should be carefully investigated. We benchmark several universal IPs using
equilibrium zeolite structures as testbeds. We select a diverse set of
universal IPs encompassing two major categories: (i) universal analytic IPs,
including GFN-FF, UFF, and Dreiding; (ii) pretrained universal machine learning
IPs (MLIPs), comprising CHGNet, ORB-v3, MatterSim, eSEN-30M-OAM, PFP-v7, and
EquiformerV2-lE4-lF100-S2EFS-OC22. We compare them with established tailor-made
IPs, SLC, ClayFF, and BSFF using experimental data and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations with dispersion correction as the reference. The
tested zeolite structures comprise pure silica frameworks and aluminosilicates
containing copper species, potassium, and organic cations. We found that GFN-FF
is the best among the tested universal analytic IPs, but it does not achieve
satisfactory accuracy for highly strained silica rings and aluminosilicate
systems. All MLIPs can well reproduce experimental or DFT-level geometries and
energetics. Among the universal MLIPs, the eSEN-30M-OAM model shows the most
consistent performance across all zeolite structures studied. These findings
show that the modern pretrained universal MLIPs are practical tools in zeolite
screening workflows involving various compositions.

Title: The Choice of Divergence: A Neglected Key to Mitigating Diversity
  Collapse in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward
Authors: Long Li, Jiaran Hao, Jason Klein Liu, Zhijian Zhou, Xiaoyu Tan, Wei
  Chu, Zhe Wang, Shirui Pan, Chao Qu, Yuan Qi

Comments: 26 pages, 5 figures
\\
  A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

  Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to automate reward design for
dexterous manipulation. However, no prior work has considered tactile sensing,
which is known to be critical for human-like dexterity. We present Text2Touch,
bringing LLM-crafted rewards to the challenging task of multi-axis in-hand
object rotation with real-world vision based tactile sensing in palm-up and
palm-down configurations. Our prompt engineering strategy scales to over 70
environment variables, and sim-to-real distillation enables successful policy
transfer to a tactile-enabled fully actuated four-fingered dexterous robot
hand. Text2Touch significantly outperforms a carefully tuned human-engineered
baseline, demonstrating superior rotation speed and stability while relying on
reward functions that are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler. These
results illustrate how LLM-designed rewards can significantly reduce the time
from concept to deployable dexterous tactile skills, supporting more rapid and
scalable multimodal robot learning. Project website:

Title: DepthVision: Robust Vision-Language Understanding through GAN-Based
  LiDAR-to-RGB Synthesis
Authors: Sven Kirchner, Nils Purschke, Ross Greer, Alois C. Knoll
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or
insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces
DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address
this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only
camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB
images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic
views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality
Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on
ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,
such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of
downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and
simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention
to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only
baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights
the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot
operation in real-world environments.

  Consumer Representations

\\
  Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

  Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with
audio remains underexplored -- despite audio's centrality to human
communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models
(ALMs) built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably
small amount of public audio data -- less than 30K hours (5K unique) --
Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models
on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while
distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency,
single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains
competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through
extensive ablations, we find that common complexities -- such as curriculum

are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on

Title: FLeW: Facet-Level and Adaptive Weighted Representation Learning of
  Scientific Documents
Authors: Zheng Dou, Deqing Wang, Fuzhen Zhuang, Jian Ren and Yanlin Hu
Categories: cs.IR cs.AI
Comments: Accepted by DASFAA2025
\\
  Scientific document representation learning provides powerful embeddings for
various tasks, while current methods face challenges across three approaches.
1) Contrastive training with citation-structural signals underutilizes citation
information and still generates single-vector representations. 2) Fine-grained
representation learning, which generates multiple vectors at the sentence or
aspect level, requires costly integration and lacks domain generalization. 3)
Task-aware learning depends on manually predefined task categorization,
overlooking nuanced task distinctions and requiring extra training data for
task-specific modules. To address these problems, we propose a new method that
unifies the three approaches for better representations, namely FLeW.
Specifically, we introduce a novel triplet sampling method that leverages
citation intent and frequency to enhance citation-structural signals for
training. Citation intents (background, method, result), aligned with the
general structure of scientific writing, facilitate a domain-generalized facet
partition for fine-grained representation learning. Then, we adopt a simple
weight search to adaptively integrate three facet-level embeddings into a
task-specific document embedding without task-aware fine-tuning. Experiments
show the applicability and robustness of FLeW across multiple scientific tasks
and fields, compared to prior models.

Title: $\Delta L$ Normalization: Rethink Loss Aggregation in RLVR
Authors: Zhiyuan He, Xufang Luo, Yike Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

Title: Can SSD-Mamba2 Unlock Reinforcement Learning for End-to-End Motion
  Control?
Authors: Gavin Tao, Yinuo Wang, and Jinzhao Zhou
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV cs.SY eess.IV eess.SY
Comments: 4 figures and 6 tables
\\
  End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified
perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most
deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion
backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers
struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion
incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.
We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a
selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable
both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and
near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations
(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked
SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range
dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic
self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable
training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula
that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene
complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy
efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach
consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety
(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the
same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical
fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion
control.

Comments: 22 pages, 11 figures
\\
  This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy
for optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring
of semiconductor probe cards. Failures in probe cards, including substrate
cracks and loosened screws, would critically affect semiconductor manufacturing
yield and reliability. Some failure modes could be detected by equipping a
probe card with adequate sensors. Frequency response functions from simulated
failure scenarios are adopted within a finite element model of a probe card. A
comprehensive dataset, enriched by physics-informed scenario expansion and
physics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid
Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high
accuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose
screw, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model
robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints
critical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers
actionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems
by optimizing sensor configurations. This research highlights the capability of
attention-based deep learning to advance proactive maintenance, enhancing
operational reliability and yield in semiconductor manufacturing.

Title: Beyond Rebalancing: Benchmarking Binary Classifiers Under Class
  Imbalance Without Rebalancing Techniques
Authors: Ali Nawaz, Amir Ahmad, Shehroz S. Khan
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

Title: From Classical Data to Quantum Advantage -- Quantum Policy Evaluation on
  Quantum Hardware
Authors: Daniel Hein, Simon Wiedemann, Markus Baumann, Patrik Felbinger, Justin

\\
  Quantum policy evaluation (QPE) is a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
which is quadratically more efficient than an analogous classical Monte Carlo
estimation. It makes use of a direct quantum mechanical realization of a finite
Markov decision process, in which the agent and the environment are modeled by
unitary operators and exchange states, actions, and rewards in superposition.
Previously, the quantum environment has been implemented and parametrized
manually for an illustrative benchmark using a quantum simulator. In this
paper, we demonstrate how these environment parameters can be learned from a
batch of classical observational data through quantum machine learning (QML) on

also compute policy evaluations on quantum hardware. Our experiments reveal
that, despite challenges such as noise and short coherence times, the
integration of QML and QPE shows promising potential for achieving quantum
advantage in RL.

Title: Variational Quantum Circuits in Offline Contextual Bandit Problems
Authors: Lukas Schulte, Daniel Hein, Steffen Udluft, Thomas A. Runkler
Categories: quant-ph cs.AI
DOI: 10.1109/QCE65121.2025.00190
\\
  This paper explores the application of variational quantum circuits (VQCs)
for solving offline contextual bandit problems in industrial optimization
tasks. Using the Industrial Benchmark (IB) environment, we evaluate the
performance of quantum regression models against classical models. Our findings
demonstrate that quantum models can effectively fit complex reward functions,
identify optimal configurations via particle swarm optimization (PSO), and
generalize well in noisy and sparse datasets. These results provide a proof of
concept for utilizing VQCs in offline contextual bandit problems and highlight
their potential in industrial optimization tasks.

Title: Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA): A Black-box
  Adversarial Attack against Voice Authentication and Anti-Spoofing Systems
Authors: Kamel Kamel, Hridoy Sankar Dutta, Keshav Sood, Sunil Aryal
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI
\\
  Voice Authentication Systems (VAS) use unique vocal characteristics for
verification. They are increasingly integrated into high-security sectors such
as banking and healthcare. Despite their improvements using deep learning, they
face severe vulnerabilities from sophisticated threats like deepfakes and
adversarial attacks. The emergence of realistic voice cloning complicates
detection, as systems struggle to distinguish authentic from synthetic audio.
While anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs) exist to mitigate these risks, many
rely on static detection models that can be bypassed by novel adversarial
methods, leaving a critical security gap. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we
propose the Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA), a novel method
that strategically manipulates inaudible frequency regions of AI-generated
audio. By altering the voice in imperceptible zones to the human ear, SMIA
creates adversarial samples that sound authentic while deceiving CMs. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our attack against state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models across multiple tasks, under simulated real-world conditions.
SMIA achieved a strong attack success rate (ASR) of at least 82% against
combined VAS/CM systems, at least 97.5% against standalone speaker verification
systems, and 100% against countermeasures. These findings conclusively
demonstrate that current security postures are insufficient against adaptive
adversarial attacks. This work highlights the urgent need for a paradigm shift
toward next-generation defenses that employ dynamic, context-aware frameworks
capable of evolving with the threat landscape.

\\
  In modern online learning, understanding and predicting student behavior is
crucial for enhancing engagement and optimizing educational outcomes. This
systematic review explores the integration of biosensors and Multimodal
Learning Analytics (MmLA) to analyze and predict student behavior during
computer-based learning sessions. We examine key challenges, including emotion
and attention detection, behavioral analysis, experimental design, and
demographic considerations in data collection. Our study highlights the growing
role of physiological signals, such as heart rate, brain activity, and
eye-tracking, combined with traditional interaction data and self-reports to
gain deeper insights into cognitive states and engagement levels. We synthesize
findings from 54 key studies, analyzing commonly used methodologies such as
advanced machine learning algorithms and multimodal data pre-processing
techniques. The review identifies current research trends, limitations, and
emerging directions in the field, emphasizing the transformative potential of
biosensor-driven adaptive learning systems. Our findings suggest that
integrating multimodal data can facilitate personalized learning experiences,
real-time feedback, and intelligent educational interventions, ultimately
advancing toward a more customized and adaptive online learning experience.

Title: Spectral and Rhythm Feature Performance Evaluation for Category and
  Class Level Audio Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Friedrich Wolf-Monheim
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG eess.AS
\\
  Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains
like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various
spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy
normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input
data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm
features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification
is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000
labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning
pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for
multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the
mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then
the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio
classification tasks using deep CNNs.

Title: What Were You Thinking? An LLM-Driven Large-Scale Study of Refactoring
  Motivations in Open-Source Projects
Authors: Mikel Robredo and Matteo Esposito and Fabio Palomba and Rafael
  Pe\~naloza and Valentina Lenarduzzi
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.PL
\\
  Context. Code refactoring improves software quality without changing external
behavior. Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable
cost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding
why developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may
support wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We
performed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring
activity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying
motivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous
motivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in
80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They
enriched 22% of motivations with more detailed rationale, often highlighting
readability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were
pragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related
to developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation
with motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs
effectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural
reasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when
combined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches. Such integration
offers a promising path toward prioritizing refactoring more systematically and
balancing short-term improvements with long-term architectural goals.

Title: Individual utilities of life satisfaction reveal inequality aversion
  unrelated to political alignment
Authors: Crispin Cooper, Ana Friedrich, Tommaso Reggiani, Wouter Poortinga
Categories: econ.GN cs.AI cs.CY q-fin.EC
Comments: 28 pages, 4 figures
\\
  How should well-being be prioritised in society, and what trade-offs are
people willing to make between fairness and personal well-being? We investigate
these questions using a stated preference experiment with a nationally
representative UK sample (n = 300), in which participants evaluated life
satisfaction outcomes for both themselves and others under conditions of
uncertainty. Individual-level utility functions were estimated using an
Expected Utility Maximisation (EUM) framework and tested for sensitivity to the
overweighting of small probabilities, as characterised by Cumulative Prospect
Theory (CPT). A majority of participants displayed concave (risk-averse)
utility curves and showed stronger aversion to inequality in societal life
satisfaction outcomes than to personal risk. These preferences were unrelated
to political alignment, suggesting a shared normative stance on fairness in
well-being that cuts across ideological boundaries. The results challenge use
of average life satisfaction as a policy metric, and support the development of
nonlinear utility-based alternatives that more accurately reflect collective
human values. Implications for public policy, well-being measurement, and the
design of value-aligned AI systems are discussed.

Title: Enhanced SegNet with Integrated Grad-CAM for Interpretable Retinal Layer
  Segmentation in OCT Images
Authors: S M Asiful Islam Saky and Ugyen Tshering
Categories: eess.IV cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is essential for diagnosing conditions
such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.
Accurate retinal layer segmentation enables quantitative biomarkers critical
for clinical decision-making, but manual segmentation is time-consuming and
variable, while conventional deep learning models often lack interpretability.
This work proposes an improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for
automated and interpretable retinal layer segmentation. Architectural
innovations, including modified pooling strategies, enhance feature extraction
from noisy OCT images, while a hybrid loss function combining categorical
cross-entropy and Dice loss improves performance for thin and imbalanced
retinal layers. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is
integrated to provide visual explanations, allowing clinical validation of
model decisions. Trained and validated on the Duke OCT dataset, the framework
achieved 95.77% validation accuracy, a Dice coefficient of 0.9446, and a
Jaccard Index (IoU) of 0.8951. Class-wise results confirmed robust performance
across most layers, with challenges remaining for thinner boundaries. Grad-CAM
visualizations highlighted anatomically relevant regions, aligning segmentation
with clinical biomarkers and improving transparency. By combining architectural
improvements, a customized hybrid loss, and explainable AI, this study delivers
a high-performing SegNet-based framework that bridges the gap between accuracy
and interpretability. The approach offers strong potential for standardizing
OCT analysis, enhancing diagnostic efficiency, and fostering clinical trust in
AI-driven ophthalmic tools.

  This study applies a range of forecasting techniques,including ARIMA,
Prophet, Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM), Temporal Convolutional
Networks (TCN), and XGBoost, to model and predict Russian equipment losses
during the ongoing war in Ukraine. Drawing on daily and monthly open-source
intelligence (OSINT) data from WarSpotting, we aim to assess trends in
attrition, evaluate model performance, and estimate future loss patterns
through the end of 2025. Our findings show that deep learning models,
particularly TCN and LSTM, produce stable and consistent forecasts, especially
under conditions of high temporal granularity. By comparing different model
architectures and input structures, this study highlights the importance of
ensemble forecasting in conflict modeling, and the value of publicly available
OSINT data in quantifying material degradation over time.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this
position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover
scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable
performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

Title: Breaking Android with AI: A Deep Dive into LLM-Powered Exploitation
Authors: Wanni Vidulige Ishan Perera, Xing Liu, Fan liang, Junyi Zhang
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
\\
  The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) has opened up new opportunities in the area of cybersecurity, especially
in the exploitation automation landscape and penetration testing. This study
explores Android penetration testing automation using LLM-based tools,
especially PentestGPT, to identify and execute rooting techniques. Through a
comparison of the traditional manual rooting process and exploitation methods
produced using AI, this study evaluates the efficacy, reliability, and
scalability of automated penetration testing in achieving high-level privilege
access on Android devices. With the use of an Android emulator (Genymotion) as
the testbed, we fully execute both traditional and exploit-based rooting
methods, automating the process using AI-generated scripts. Secondly, we create
a web application by integrating OpenAI's API to facilitate automated script
generation from LLM-processed responses. The research focuses on the
effectiveness of AI-enabled exploitation by comparing automated and manual
penetration testing protocols, by determining LLM weaknesses and strengths
along the way. We also provide security suggestions of AI-enabled exploitation,
including ethical factors and potential misuse. The findings exhibit that while
LLMs can significantly streamline the workflow of exploitation, they need to be
controlled by humans to ensure accuracy and ethical application. This study
adds to the increasing body of literature on AI-powered cybersecurity and its
effect on ethical hacking, security research, and mobile device security.

Title: ImportSnare: Directed "Code Manual" Hijacking in Retrieval-Augmented
  Code Generation
Authors: Kai Ye, Liangcai Su, Chenxiong Qian
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
Comments: This paper has been accepted by the ACM Conference on Computer and
  Communications Security (CCS) 2025
\\
  Code generation has emerged as a pivotal capability of Large Language
Models(LLMs), revolutionizing development efficiency for programmers of all
skill levels. However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic
often results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in
generated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual
debugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness
and security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces
new attack surfaces.
  In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in
Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency
hijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden
malicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting
dual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM
suggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel
attack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam
search optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in
retrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate
jailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious
dependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and
JavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for
popular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able
to succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both
custom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply
chain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security
alignment for code generation tasks. To support future research, we will
release the multilingual benchmark suite and datasets. The project homepage is

  Multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models (FMs) have recently shown
transformative potential in artificial intelligence, with emerging applications
in education. However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is
hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data
availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for
education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to
enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized
institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently,
this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored
approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its
related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three
critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy
preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research
challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy
regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning
frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must
be collectively addressed for practical deployment.

Title: ACE and Diverse Generalization via Selective Disagreement
Authors: Oliver Daniels and Stuart Armstrong and Alexandre Maranh\~ao and
  Mahirah Fairuz Rahman and Benjamin M. Marlin and Rebecca Gorman
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

Title: Beyond Sequential Reranking: Reranker-Guided Search Improves Reasoning
  Intensive Retrieval
Authors: Haike Xu, Tong Chen
Categories: cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  The widely used retrieve-and-rerank pipeline faces two critical limitations:
they are constrained by the initial retrieval quality of the top-k documents,
and the growing computational demands of LLM-based rerankers restrict the
number of documents that can be effectively processed. We introduce
Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations
by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than
following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy
search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor
algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based
on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9
on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100
documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and
reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly
improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.

ACM-class: I.2.7; I.2.6; J.3
\\
  Text generating capabilities have undergone a substantial transformation with
the introduction of large language models (LLMs). Electroencephalography
(EEG)-based text production is still difficult, though, because it requires a
lot of data and processing power. This paper introduces a new method that
combines the use of the Gemma 2B LLM with a classifier-LLM architecture to
incorporate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder. Our approach drastically
lowers the amount of data and compute power needed while achieving performance
close to that of cutting-edge methods. Notably, compared to current
methodologies, our methodology delivers an overall performance improvement of
10%. The suggested architecture demonstrates the possibility of effective
transfer learning for EEG-based text production, remaining strong and
functional even in the face of data limits. This work highlights the potential
of integrating LLMs with EEG decoding to improve assistive technologies and
improve independence and communication for those with severe motor limitations.
Our method pushes the limits of present capabilities and opens new paths for
research and application in brain-computer interfaces by efficiently using the
strengths of pre-trained language models. This makes EEG-based text production
more accessible and efficient.

Title: Benchmarking Vision Transformers and CNNs for Thermal Photovoltaic Fault
  Detection with Explainable AI Validation
Authors: Serra Aksoy
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
Comments: 28 Pages, 4 Figures
\\
  Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

Title: GCond: Gradient Conflict Resolution via Accumulation-based Stabilization
  for Large-Scale Multi-Task Learning
Authors: Evgeny Alves Limarenko, Anastasiia Alexandrovna Studenikina
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
Comments: Preprint. Submitted to PeerJ
\\
  In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

Title: Kernel VICReg for Self-Supervised Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
  Space
Authors: M.Hadi Sepanj, Benyamin Ghojogh, Paul Fieguth
Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
representation learning by optimizing geometric objectives--such as invariance
to augmentations, variance preservation, and feature decorrelation--without
requiring labels. However, most existing methods operate in Euclidean space,
limiting their ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and geometric
structures. In this work, we propose Kernel VICReg, a novel self-supervised
learning framework that lifts the VICReg objective into a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). By kernelizing each term of the loss-variance,
invariance, and covariance--we obtain a general formulation that operates on
double-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, enabling nonlinear
feature learning without explicit mappings.
  We demonstrate that Kernel VICReg not only avoids representational collapse
but also improves performance on tasks with complex or small-scale data.
Empirical evaluations across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet100 show consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg, with particularly
strong improvements on datasets where nonlinear structures are prominent. UMAP
visualizations further confirm that kernel-based embeddings exhibit better
isometry and class separation. Our results suggest that kernelizing SSL
objectives is a promising direction for bridging classical kernel methods with
modern representation learning.

  Cardiac arrest is one of the biggest global health problems, and early
identification and management are key to enhancing the patient's prognosis. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection
and analysis of cardiac arrest. We use compound scaling and EfficientNet to
learn the features of cardiovascular images. In parallel, the digital twin
creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

\\
  The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling seamless
connectivity and intelligent home automation, particularly in food management.
By integrating IoT with computer vision, the smart fridge employs an ESP32-CAM
to establish a monitoring subsystem that enhances food management efficiency
through real-time food detection, inventory tracking, and temperature
monitoring. This benefits waste reduction, grocery planning improvement, and
household consumption optimization. In high-density inventory conditions,
capturing partial or layered images complicates object detection, as
overlapping items and occluded views hinder accurate identification and
counting. Besides, varied angles and obscured details in multi-layered setups
reduce algorithm reliability, often resulting in miscounts or
misclassifications. Our proposed system is structured into three core modules:
data pre-processing, object detection and management, and a web-based
visualization. To address the challenge of poor model calibration caused by
overconfident predictions, we implement a variant of focal loss that mitigates
over-confidence and under-confidence in multi-category classification. This
approach incorporates adaptive, class-wise error calibration via temperature
scaling and evaluates the distribution of predicted probabilities across
methods. Our results demonstrate that robust functional calibration
significantly improves detection reliability under varying lighting conditions
and scalability challenges. Further analysis demonstrates a practical,
user-focused approach to modern food management, advancing sustainable living
goals through reduced waste and more informed consumption.

Title: Neural Cone Radiosity for Interactive Global Illumination with Glossy
  Materials
Authors: Jierui Ren, Haojie Jin, Bo Pang, Yisong Chen, Guoping Wang, Sheng Li
Categories: cs.GR cs.CV
\\
  Modeling of high-frequency outgoing radiance distributions has long been a
key challenge in rendering, particularly for glossy material. Such
distributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly
sensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity
methods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable
limitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance
distributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by
reflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,
named neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered
multi-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,
embedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding
process through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only
significantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection
distributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of
glossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our
method reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,
allowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
produces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various
glossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to
baseline approaches.

Categories: physics.ao-ph cs.CV

  Ice-containing clouds strongly impact climate, but they are hard to model due
to ice crystal habit (i.e., shape) diversity. We use self-supervised learning
(SSL) to learn latent representations of crystals from ice crystal imagery. By
pre-training a vision transformer with many cloud particle images, we learn
robust representations of crystal morphology, which can be used for various
science-driven tasks. Our key contributions include (1) validating that our SSL
approach can be used to learn meaningful representations, and (2) presenting a
relevant application where we quantify ice crystal diversity with these latent
representations. Our results demonstrate the power of SSL-driven
representations to improve the characterization of ice crystals and
subsequently constrain their role in Earth's climate system.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have scaled rapidly in size and complexity,
requiring increasingly intricate parallelism for distributed training, such as
3D parallelism. This sophistication motivates a shift toward simpler, more
debuggable programming paradigm like Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD).
However, SPMD in eager execution introduces two key challenges: ensuring
consistency with single-device execution and achieving high performance at
scale. In this paper, we introduce veScale, an eager-mode training system that
fully embraces SPMD paradigm to democratize distributed tensor programming.
veScale addresses the prevalent issue of inconsistent results in systems like
PyTorch by introducing a novel algorithm of distributed Random Number
Generation (RNG) compatible with arbitrary sharded operators. veScale also
significantly boosts training performance by reducing PyTorch primitive's
overhead and improving communication efficiency. Evaluations show that veScale
delivers up to 2.2x speedup over the state-of-the-art training systems, like
TorchTitan, and cuts code complexity by 78.4%, while preserving
single-device-equivalent results.

Title: Fed-REACT: Federated Representation Learning for Heterogeneous and
  Evolving Data
Authors: Yiyue Chen, Usman Akram, Chianing Wang, Haris Vikalo
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC
\\
  Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Title: FedTeddi: Temporal Drift and Divergence Aware Scheduling for Timely
  Federated Edge Learning
Authors: Yuxuan Bai, Yuxuan Sun, Tan Chen, Wei Chen, Sheng Zhou, Zhisheng Niu
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC
Comments: Submitted to IEEE for possible publication
\\
  Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While
most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

Title: HYLU: Hybrid Parallel Sparse LU Factorization

\\
  This article introduces HYLU, a hybrid parallel LU factorization-based
general-purpose solver designed for efficiently solving sparse linear systems
(Ax=b) on multi-core shared-memory architectures. The key technical feature of
HYLU is the integration of hybrid numerical kernels so that it can adapt to
various sparsity patterns of coefficient matrices. Tests on 34 sparse matrices
from SuiteSparse Matrix Collection reveal that HYLU outperforms Intel MKL
PARDISO in the numerical factorization phase by geometric means of 1.74X (for
one-time solving) and 2.26X (for repeated solving). HYLU can be downloaded from

Title: MoE-Compression: How the Compression Error of Experts Affects the
  Inference Accuracy of MoE Model?
Authors: Songkai Ma, Zhaorui Zhang, Sheng Di, Benben Liu, Xiaodong Yu, Xiaoyi
  Lu, Dan Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC
\\
  With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

Title: Decentralized Online Riemannian Optimization Beyond Hadamard Manifolds
Authors: Emre Sahinoglu, Shahin Shahrampour
Categories: math.OC cs.LG cs.MA
\\
  We study decentralized online Riemannian optimization over manifolds with
possibly positive curvature, going beyond the Hadamard manifold setting.
Decentralized optimization techniques rely on a consensus step that is well
understood in Euclidean spaces because of their linearity. However, in
positively curved Riemannian spaces, a main technical challenge is that
geodesic distances may not induce a globally convex structure. In this work, we
first analyze a curvature-aware Riemannian consensus step that enables a linear
convergence beyond Hadamard manifolds. Building on this step, we establish a
$O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the decentralized online Riemannian gradient
descent algorithm. Then, we investigate the two-point bandit feedback setup,
where we employ computationally efficient gradient estimators using smoothing
techniques, and we demonstrate the same $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound through the
subconvexity analysis of smoothed objectives.

  We propose a model of opinion formation on resource allocation among multiple
topics by multiple agents, who are subject to hard budget constraints. We
define a utility function for each agent and then derive a projected dynamical
system model of opinion evolution assuming that each agent myopically seeks to
maximize its utility subject to its constraints. Inter-agent coupling arises
from an undirected social network, while inter-topic coupling arises from
resource constraints. We show that opinions always converge to the equilibrium
set. For special networks with very weak antagonistic relations, the opinions
converge to a unique equilibrium point. We further show that the underlying
opinion formation game is a potential game. We relate the equilibria of the
dynamics and the Nash equilibria of the game and characterize the unique Nash
equilibrium for networks with no antagonistic relations. Finally, simulations
illustrate our findings.
