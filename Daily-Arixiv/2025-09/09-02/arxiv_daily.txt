Title: A Comparative Study of Controllability, Explainability, and Performance
  in Dysfluency Detection Models
Authors: Eric Zhang, Li Wei, Sarah Chen, Michael Wang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling
paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks
(YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on
benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than
accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative
approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:
performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive
evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that
YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited
transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical
interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in
our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing
approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency
modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical
deployment considerations for each approach.

Title: Beyond Memorization: Reasoning-Driven Synthesis as a Mitigation Strategy
  Against Benchmark Contamination
Authors: Terry Jingchen Zhang, Gopal Dev, Ning Wang, Nicole Ni, Wenyuan Jiang,

Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Code and Dataset: https://github.com/TerryJCZhang/BeyondMemorization
\\
  Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether
static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an
empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize
research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal
structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge
cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model
represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643
multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified
over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.
Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near
knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release
dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal
studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly
retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step
reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that
goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation
strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and
dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that
prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply
collecting newly released questions periodically.

Title: Language and Experience: A Computational Model of Social Learning in
  Complex Tasks
Authors: C\'edric Colas, Tracey Mills, Ben Prystawski, Michael Henry Tessler,
  Noah Goodman, Jacob Andreas, Joshua Tenenbaum
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

Title: Entropy-Guided Loop: Achieving Reasoning through Uncertainty-Aware
  Generation
Authors: Andrew G. A. Correa, Ana C. H de Matos
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 9 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables
DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16955206
\\
  Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher
cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight,
test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted
refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$
alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum
token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use
entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report
(tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide
corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning,
mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches
95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the
cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while
improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We
demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle
ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it
practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

Title: Wrong Face, Wrong Move: The Social Dynamics of Emotion Misperception in
  Agent-Based Models
Authors: David Freire-Obreg\'on
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Accepted for presentation at the International Workshop on
  Agent-Based Modelling of Human Behaviour (ABMHuB 2025)
\\
  The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is
fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated
with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual
accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually
represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of
three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)
datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving
neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with
movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative
emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,
emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of
experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and
scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy
classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,
emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By
contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional
clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral
scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration
of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in
emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt
emotional integration.

Title: Ensemble Debates with Local Large Language Models for AI Alignment
Authors: Ephraiem Sarabamoun
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: 9 pages, 2 tables
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes
decisions, alignment with human values is essential. Reliance on proprietary
APIs limits reproducibility and broad participation. We study whether local
open-source ensemble debates can improve alignmentoriented reasoning. Across
150 debates spanning 15 scenarios and five ensemble configurations, ensembles
outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13),
with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality
(+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human
enhancement (+0.80). We provide code, prompts, and a debate data set, providing
an accessible and reproducible foundation for ensemble-based alignment
evaluation.

Title: MODE: Mixture of Document Experts for RAG
Authors: Rahul Anand
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases
and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for
small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document
Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor
search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into
semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query
time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those
clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking
while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,
MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while
reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and
multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter
clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small
and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

Title: Adaptive Monitoring and Real-World Evaluation of Agentic AI Systems
Authors: Manish Shukla
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.MA
\\
  Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

Title: Know When to Explore: Difficulty-Aware Certainty as a Guide for LLM
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Ang Li, Zhihang Yuan, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Yisen Wang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key
technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only
indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular
guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient
learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient
solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To
address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task
difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided
Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to
dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task
difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal
to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is
struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for
easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.
Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show
that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models
not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance
when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters
effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

Title: Optimizing Health Coverage in Ethiopia: A Learning-augmented Approach
  and Persistent Proportionality Under an Online Budget
Authors: Davin Choo, Yohai Trabelsi, Fentabil Getnet, Samson Warkaye Lamma,

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare
services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort
can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing
priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization
across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access
Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization
framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population
coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific
proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)
a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any
single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical
efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

  We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within
multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of
evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We
completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and
"soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment
of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these
languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize
the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static
bases.

Title: HiVA: Self-organized Hierarchical Variable Agent via Goal-driven
  Semantic-Topological Evolution
Authors: Jinzhou Tang, Jusheng Zhang, Qinhan Lv, Sidi Liu, Jing Yang, Chengpei
  Tang, Keze Wang
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA
\\
  Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General
Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical
trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration
upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to
distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce
Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic
workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution
(STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using
textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The
iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing,
diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated
updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective
optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding,
Long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements
of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing
baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

Title: Universal Deep Research: Bring Your Own Model and Strategy

\\
  Deep research tools are among the most impactful and most commonly
encountered agentic systems today. We observe, however, that each deep research
agent introduced so far is hard-coded to carry out a particular research
strategy using a fixed choice of tools. We introduce Universal Deep Research
(UDR), a generalist agentic system that wraps around any language model and
enables the user to create, edit, and refine their own entirely custom deep
research strategies without any need for additional training or finetuning. To
showcase the generality of our system, we equip UDR with example minimal,
expansive, and intensive research strategies, and provide a user interface to
facilitate experimentation with the system.

Title: Instruction-Level Weight Shaping: A Framework for Self-Improving AI
  Agents
Authors: Rimom Costa
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 12 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables
ACM-class: I.2.7; I.2.6; I.2.11
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after
pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and
engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is
brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks
catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):
curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters
updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection
Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and
failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$
over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,
evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first
failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a
threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills
matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space
improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the
low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves
governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased
throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen
baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved
4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous
instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the
instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic
domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool
creation, and low-latency deployment.

Title: SHERPA: A Model-Driven Framework for Large Language Model Execution
Authors: Boqi Chen, Kua Chen, Jos\'e Antonio Hern\'andez L\'opez, Gunter

Comments: MODELS 2025
\\
  Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application
across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from
a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks
requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the
training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best
practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained
popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this
paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM
performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best
practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution
processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over
their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based
approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety
of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question
answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving
the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the
aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares
different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without
state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines
significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly
beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but
lacking data used for training LLMs.

Title: SIGMUS: Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal Urban
  Spaces
Authors: Brian Wang, Mani Srivastava
Categories: cs.AI cs.CY
Comments: 9 pages, accepted at UrbComp 2025 KDD 2025
\\
  Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,
all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used
to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,
such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural
disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and
difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for
identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an
incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an
incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the
causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and
intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create
SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal
Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary
world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in
urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize
evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and
human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This
organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,
observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce
reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV
images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents
occurring at the same time and location.

Title: NEWSAGENT: Benchmarking Multimodal Agents as Journalists with Real-World
  Newswriting Tasks
Authors: Yen-Che Chien, Kuang-Da Wang, Wei-Yao Wang and Wen-Chih Peng
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Preprint
\\
  Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI
and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by
autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear
to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data
productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires
iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal
raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a
benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw
contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news
article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction
and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are
tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,
retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical
summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available
and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in
real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived
from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model
compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used
agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of
retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative
integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating
and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation
to real-world productivity.

Title: Artificial Intelligence-Based Analysis of Ice Cream Melting Behavior
  Under Various Ingredients
Authors: Zhang Lai Bin and Zhen Bin It
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's
acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve
texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report
explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and
carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective
was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify
a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each
additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled
conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the
progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and
analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure
even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of
a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen
and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating
improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the
different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some
offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.
Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly
used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance
and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that

Title: LLM-Assisted Iterative Evolution with Swarm Intelligence Toward
  SuperBrain

\\
  We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

Title: Text-to-Layout: A Generative Workflow for Drafting Architectural Floor
  Plans Using LLMs
Authors: Jayakrishna Duggempudi, Lu Gao, Ahmed Senouci, Zhe Han, and Yunpeng
  Zhang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  This paper presents the development of an AI-powered workflow that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assist in drafting schematic architectural floor
plans from natural language prompts. The proposed system interprets textual
input to automatically generate layout options including walls, doors, windows,
and furniture arrangements. It combines prompt engineering, a furniture
placement refinement algorithm, and Python scripting to produce spatially
coherent draft plans compatible with design tools such as Autodesk Revit. A
case study of a mid-sized residential layout demonstrates the approach's
ability to generate functional and structured outputs with minimal manual
effort. The workflow is designed for transparent replication, with all key
prompt specifications documented to enable independent implementation by other
researchers. In addition, the generated models preserve the full range of
Revit-native parametric attributes required for direct integration into
professional BIM processes.

Title: Social World Models
Authors: Xuhui Zhou, Jiarui Liu, Akhila Yerukola, Hyunwoo Kim, Maarten Sap
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken
dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited
information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and
reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a
novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help
AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a
POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,
such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be
automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show
S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social
reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning
with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then
induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating
their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent
decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social
interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a
powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the
development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social
interactions.

Title: BALM-TSF: Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series
  Forecasting
Authors: Shiqiao Zhou, Holger Sch\"oner, Huanbo Lyu, Edouard Fouch\'e, Shuo

ACM-class: H.3; I.2
DOI: 10.1145/3746252.3761278
\\
  Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research
topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research
has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing
textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast
discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal
architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,
resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address
this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment
for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting
framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw
time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive
statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,
producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context
alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling
strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual
embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the
aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together
integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show
that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability
to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is
available at https://github.com/ShiqiaoZhou/BALM-TSF.

Title: NetGent: Agent-Based Automation of Network Application Workflows
Authors: Jaber Daneshamooz, Eugene Vuong, Laasya Koduru, Sanjay Chandrasekaran,
  Arpit Gupta
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application
workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing
generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network
environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web
applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are
diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.
NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as
natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract
specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which
a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This
design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state
caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,
NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,
live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,
producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By
combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of
compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the
diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

Title: On Verifiable Legal Reasoning: A Multi-Agent Framework with Formalized
  Knowledge Representations
Authors: Albert Sadowski, Jaros{\l}aw A. Chudziak
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: Accepted for publication at the 34th ACM International Conference on
  Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '25)
\\
  Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

Title: OmniDPO: A Preference Optimization Framework to Address Omni-Modal
  Hallucination
Authors: Junzhe Chen, Tianshu Zhang, Shiyu Huang, Yuwei Niu, Chao Sun, Rongzhou
  Zhang, Guanyu Zhou, Lijie Wen, Xuming Hu
Categories: cs.AI cs.MM
\\
  Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of
research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video
understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination
issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text
modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues
while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal
scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or
auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the
intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This
oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden
audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations
in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing
text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of
audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample
pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.
By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding
and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that
OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.
All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

Title: Efficient Graph Understanding with LLMs via Structured Context Injection
Authors: Govind Waghmare, Sumedh BG, Sonia Gupta, Srikanta Bedathur
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving
problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed
by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for
structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically
embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems.
Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and
lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging
for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations.
However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step
querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical
alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling
the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We
evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large
models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that
structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our
findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective
and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

Title: L-MARS -- Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
  Agentic Search
Authors: Ziqi Wang, Boqin Yuan
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

  AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

Title: Sharpe Ratio Optimization in Markov Decision Processes
Authors: Shuai Ma, Guangwu Liu and Li Xia
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used
metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit
of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of
Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there
exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is
that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other
is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we
study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both
the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge
with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a
mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization
and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when
the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the
second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V
optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We
iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that
is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V
problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is
monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both
average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure
and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted
for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that
solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type
algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving
MDPs with other fractional objectives.

  This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process
Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring
(PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based
prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for
suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints
due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.
We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite
traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.
Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a
soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be
combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to
generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental
evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix
prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce
two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their
effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the
context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation
task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

  Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed

Title: Robust Deep Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization: Addressing
  Theoretical Risks in Neural Fictitious Self-Play
Authors: Zakaria El Jaafari
Categories: cs.AI cs.GT stat.ML
\\
  Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a
cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration
with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest
differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and
proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify
that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action
support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have
scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation
strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR
framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform
exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive
diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc
Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify
critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final
exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the
classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective
component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the
classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful
component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include:
(1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled
mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale
experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and
(4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

  Fine-Tuning of LLMs
Authors: Yanxiao Zhao, Yaqian Li, Zihao Bo, Rinyoichi Takezoe, Haojia Hui, Mo
  Guang, Lei Ren, Xiaolin Qin, Kaiwen Long
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and
enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of
controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks
and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional,
systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To
address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier
designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating
diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems
along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question
format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer
verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for
nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective
reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using
SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,
particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,
we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially
improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,
while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through
these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool
and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and
connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented
opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale,
latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends
physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph
representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language
models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world
constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with
physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating
heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge,
LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in
real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources.
Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go
beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting
physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation,
this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and
sustainable smart infrastructures.

\\
  This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for
pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology
transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective
indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and
deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which
evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a
unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying
explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their
technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework"
that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands
(Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail
the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial
Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and
real-world credibility.

Title: Ultra Strong Machine Learning: Teaching Humans Active Learning

Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that
not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired
knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present
LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic
method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models
(LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural
language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing
hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through
systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we
demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM
prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach
transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning
experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human
performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may
overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.
Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to

reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General
Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases:
tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary
performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.
Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on
Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an
agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We
are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training
costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift,
ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively
impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing
returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning
techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the
availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

  Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Title: Causal MAS: A Survey of Large Language Model Architectures for Discovery
  and Effect Estimation
Authors: Adib Bazgir, Amir Habibdoust, Yuwen Zhang, Xing Song
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 24 pages. 2 figures
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex
causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active
development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious
correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or
personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the
collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are
emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper
explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these
systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal
reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the
estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns
and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate
frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.
Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse
application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,
including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized
systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research
questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to
provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.

  Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to
manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for
data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a
high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given
task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of
agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue
that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We
take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,
i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number
of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,
ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new
agentic memory stores.

  Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited
examples and apply them to novel situations. In this work, we compare an
LLM-based hypothesis search framework with direct program generation approaches
on few-shot rule induction tasks. Our findings show that hypothesis search
achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation
falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis
generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods.
Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search
for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient
systems.

\\
  By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born
Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open
computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This
involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and
the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to
create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by
considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution
environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the
reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while
repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds
significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which
focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,
which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an
interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates
self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum
logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,
giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to
quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are
formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed
quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for
controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

  We introduce the Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP), a challenging component
of large warehouse management which involves rearranging storage blocks within
dense grids to achieve a target state. We formally define the BRaP as a graph
search problem. Building on intuitions from sliding puzzle problems, we propose
five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.
Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number,
our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply
buried blocks in up to 80x80 grids.

  GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is

Comments: Tech report. Project page: https://robix-seed.github.io/robix/
\\
  We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery
shopping, and dietary filtering.

  This note illustrates how a variety of causal abstraction arXiv:1707.00819
arXiv:1812.03789, defined here as causal abstractive simulation, can be used to
formalize a simple example of language model simulation. This note considers
the case of simulating a fair coin toss with a language model. Examples are
presented illustrating the ways language models can fail to simulate, and a
success case is presented, illustrating how this formalism may be used to prove
that a language model simulates some other system, given a causal description
of the system. This note may be of interest to three groups. For practitioners
in the growing field of language model simulation, causal abstractive
simulation is a means to connect ad-hoc statistical benchmarking practices to
the solid formal foundation of causality. Philosophers of AI and philosophers
of mind may be interested as causal abstractive simulation gives a precise
operationalization to the idea that language models are role-playing
arXiv:2402.12422. Mathematicians and others working on causal abstraction may
be interested to see a new application of the core ideas that yields a new
variation of causal abstraction.

  Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

Title: Towards Open-World Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Knowledge Graph: A
  Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework
Authors: Jiasheng Xu, Mingda Li, Yongqiang Tang, Peijie Wang, Wensheng Zhang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static
training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating
external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which
provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG
approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to
initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings
where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To
overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent
collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor
entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate
anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes
independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from
each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval
strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge
paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework
improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or
erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate
that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new
state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

Title: Towards Agentic OS: An LLM Agent Framework for Linux Schedulers
Authors: Yusheng Zheng, Yanpeng Hu, Wei Zhang, Andi Quinn
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA cs.OS
\\
  Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where
kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to
suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables
fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently
optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that
the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled
control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to
optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act").
Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable
interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving
Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all
AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic
analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent
system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling
policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation
shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x
cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high
success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level
system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly
self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced

  With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation
of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments
in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is
undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models
are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show
video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline
through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of
a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of
video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.
These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming
user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam
achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while
substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates
videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%.
Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and
customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production
by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need
for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative
potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a
pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.DB
\\
  Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

Title: Conformal Predictive Monitoring for Multi-Modal Scenarios
Authors: Francesca Cairoli, Luca Bortolussi, Jyotirmoy V. Deshmukh, Lars
  Lindemann, Nicola Paoletti
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of
stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a
desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since
computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted
violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast
machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the
satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.
However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal
dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others
critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so
would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack
meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we
present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically
score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and
multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM
employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical
mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically
valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,
resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less
conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

Title: Error Notebook-Guided, Training-Free Part Retrieval in 3D CAD Assemblies
  via Vision-Language Models
Authors: Yunqing Liu, Nan Zhang, Zhiming Tan
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is
essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks.
However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the
input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing,
performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires
significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use
proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.
In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no
extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering
to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The
construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting
historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these
CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.
As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with
their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve
specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them
into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a
human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In
addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to

Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,

accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation
studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging
cases with higher part counts (>10).

  Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.

Title: The Need for Verification in AI-Driven Scientific Discovery

  and Lior Horesh
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of science. Machine
learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale
and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to
accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of
hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable
mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather
than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of
scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for
scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from
data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic
reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns
and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on
rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone
of AI-assisted discovery.

Title: LLM-empowered Agents Simulation Framework for Scenario Generation in
  Service Ecosystem Governance
Authors: Deyu Zhou, Yuqi Hou, Xiao Xue, Xudong Lu, Qingzhong Li, Lizhen Cui
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA
\\
  As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is
deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are
constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research
issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals
by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses
caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on
predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited
information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of
measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of
generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,
we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates
three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize
experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high
quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social
environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social
collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role
relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with
the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states
of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the
ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios
more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service
ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.

Title: Counterfactual Sensitivity for Faithful Reasoning in Language Models
Authors: Ibne Farabi Shihab, Sanjeda Akter, Anuj Sharma
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on
flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in
high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization
(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between
intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,
operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-")
during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under
logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per
sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome
Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model
predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical
deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness
by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process
supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes
to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as
self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that
extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in
commonsense reasoning.

  With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to
decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the
aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the
ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable
and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to
addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured
decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The
proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous
decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing
concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's
performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based
insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,
volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured
decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently
accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based
systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These
findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework
for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical
contexts.

Title: Throttling Web Agents Using Reasoning Gates
Authors: Abhinav Kumar, Jaechul Roh, Ali Naseh, Amir Houmansadr, Eugene

Categories: cs.AI cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and
complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or
erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,
web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or
flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect
their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web
agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on
agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.
We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that
are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a
common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve
reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,
we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates
fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based
Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over
world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable
generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework
achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x
higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning
gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate
with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and
environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

Title: Unraveling LLM Jailbreaks Through Safety Knowledge Neurons
Authors: Chongwen Zhao and Kaizhu Huang
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

Title: An LLM-enabled semantic-centric framework to consume privacy policies
Authors: Rui Zhao, Vladyslav Melnychuk, Jun Zhao, Jesse Wright, Nigel Shadbolt
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

  Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

  Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

  Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread
adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment
challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work
has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches
suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance
fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur
excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over
the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address
these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous
online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration
with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment
preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end
latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single
parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or
any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks
demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless
acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to
60%. Our code and data are available through

Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.CY cs.LG
\\
  Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

  Clinical Decision Support
Authors: Shreyash Adappanavar, Krithi Shailya, Gokul S Krishnan, Sriraam

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical
settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and
amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness
evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use
simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.
This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,
defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our
contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,
controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from
MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and
three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -
Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness
for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and
Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated
Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs
between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four
open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and
their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our
findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more
effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust
performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but
deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and
evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for
healthcare.

Title: AGI as Second Being: The Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence
Authors: Maijunxian Wang, Ran Ji
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can
perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper
proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence
exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into
reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions --
generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies
real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain
surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of
intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to
meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as
a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

Title: LLMs for LLMs: A Structured Prompting Methodology for Long Legal
  Documents
Authors: Strahinja Klem, Noura Al Moubayed
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 20 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables,
\\
  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative
effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has
proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and
transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a
viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of
tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information
retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking
and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an
engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for
each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem
with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse
Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose
model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase
reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black
box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously
presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the
limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,
serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this
work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a
useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility
of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological
research, and the analysis and surveillance of disease outbreaks.

Title: Rewarding Explainability in Drug Repurposing with Knowledge Graphs
Authors: Susana Nunes, Samy Badreddine, Catia Pesquita

Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures, accepted at conference IJCAI 2025
\\
  Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex,
multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in
applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain
acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but
also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper
presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in
link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms
that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a
reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within
a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific
ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in
established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing
using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate
its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against
biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in
predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance
AI-driven scientific discovery.

Title: Re-evaluating LLM-based Heuristic Search: A Case Study on the 3D Packing
  Problem
Authors: Guorui Quan, Mingfei Sun, Manuel L\'opez-Ib\'a\~nez
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their
application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within
human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open
question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver
for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved
fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint
scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative
self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a
viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy
process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the
scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior
work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of
LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed
greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a
human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,
though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight
two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the
engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,
and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search
for novel solutions.

Title: Exploring Diffusion Models for Generative Forecasting of Financial
  Charts
Authors: Taegyeong Lee, Jiwon Park, Kyunga Bang, Seunghyun Hwang, Ung-Jin Jang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.

Title: Explainability-Driven Dimensionality Reduction for Hyperspectral Imaging
Authors: Salma Haidar and Jos\'e Oramas
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise
material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality
introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality
reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of
post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band
selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive
performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each
band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion
evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or
reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the
highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy
and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University
and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected
bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational
requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly
discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned,
explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective
dimensionality reduction for HSI.

Title: When Agents go Astray: Course-Correcting SWE Agents with PRMs
Authors: Shubham Gandhi and Jason Tsay and Jatin Ganhotra and Kiran Kate and
  Yara Rizk
Categories: cs.AI cs.SE
\\
  Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex,
multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often
contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and
failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated
these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In
this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM)
that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level
errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and
delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying
policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%
to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among
feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit
action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory
length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as
$0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents'
reliability and efficiency.

  Signal for Structured Reasoning

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured
biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident
outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that
leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over
multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining
self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into
reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and
support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration,
nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4
internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving
downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results
demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to
abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex
structured-data environments.

\\
  With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Comments: 11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables. Work under review
\\
  The complexity of traditional power system analysis workflows presents
significant barriers to efficient decision-making in modern electric grids.
This paper presents GridMind, a multi-agent AI system that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with deterministic engineering solvers to enable
conversational scientific computing for power system analysis. The system
employs specialized agents coordinating AC Optimal Power Flow and N-1
contingency analysis through natural language interfaces while maintaining
numerical precision via function calls. GridMind addresses workflow
integration, knowledge accessibility, context preservation, and expert
decision-support augmentation. Experimental evaluation on IEEE test cases
demonstrates that the proposed agentic framework consistently delivers correct
solutions across all tested language models, with smaller LLMs achieving
comparable analytical accuracy with reduced computational latency. This work
establishes agentic AI as a viable paradigm for scientific computing,
demonstrating how conversational interfaces can enhance accessibility while
preserving numerical rigor essential for critical engineering applications.

  The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

  The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

Title: MultiStream-LLM: Bridging Modalities for Robust Sign Language
  Translation
Authors: Marshall Thomas, Edward Fish, Richard Bowden
Categories: cs.CL cs.CV
\\
  Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic
end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural
signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the
integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in
Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped
this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously
resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information
such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a
modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs
separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and
lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a
sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight
transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined
representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.
Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a
BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging
ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core
hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion,
our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to
robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

Title: Compiling Prompts, Not Crafting Them: A Reproducible Workflow for

Authors: Teo Susnjak
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate
systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on
brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and
reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in
LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances
in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM
applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR
automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that
embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a
reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a
concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to
construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of
transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of
such approaches to SLR pipelines.

  Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large
language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the
explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily
focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic
roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT
trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the
evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via
spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically
coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we
model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and
interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range
of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern
visualization, and consistency evaluation.

Title: The Rarity Blind Spot: A Framework for Evaluating Statistical Reasoning
  in LLMs
Authors: Seiji Maekawa, Hayate Iso, Nikita Bhutani
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each
candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving
or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a
model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of
documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that
challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and
surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less
than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as
candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning,
not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we
present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable
parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using
DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining
across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance
gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however,
substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We
also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as
distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs'
abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

Title: The Differential Meaning of Models: A Framework for Analyzing the
  Structural Consequences of Semantic Modeling Decisions
Authors: Zachary K. Stine and James E. Deitrick
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes
a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems.
However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these
modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In
this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C.
S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which
can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies
underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a
model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of
performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the
particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast
with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which
models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated
as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical
use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future
directions enabled by the framework.

Title: The Temporal Game: A New Perspective on Temporal Relation Extraction
Authors: Hugo Sousa, Ricardo Campos, Al\'ipio Jorge
Categories: cs.CL
DOI: 10.1145/3746252.3761488
\\
  In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal
relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of
directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into
point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities.
At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies
temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This
point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities,
enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach.
The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning
agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.
To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game
mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive
feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom
documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore,
this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo
is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code
is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in
temporal reasoning and annotation.

  Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text
embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex
real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant
documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers
often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their
strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this
potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual
representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To
bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple
but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text
embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language
model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the
token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with
inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive
retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot
retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of
incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains,
where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These
metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual
consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale
dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand
reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated
queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide
actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research,
and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant,
and structured summaries at scale.

Title: Wage Sentiment Indices Derived from Survey Comments via Large Language
  Models
Authors: Taihei Sone
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Submitted to IEEE Big Data 2025. 10 pages, 2 tables, 16 figures
\\
  The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new
opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment
Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage
dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS),
a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures
real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to
business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index
(PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related
sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also
developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and
social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs
significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the
timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and
central banks.

Title: Balanced Actor Initialization: Stable RLHF Training of

  The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language
models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning
and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove
effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to
distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation
reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length
Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF
training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score
drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally
compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage
weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this
intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational
knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and
detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves
Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables
continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our
analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs
between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work
provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm,
enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency
with RLHF alignment.

Title: GIER: Gap-Driven Self-Refinement for Large Language Models
Authors: Rinku Dewri
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
\\
  We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general
framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through
self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike
prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought
templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and
prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better
satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact,
PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and
Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning
alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that
models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them
into concrete reasoning improvements.

Title: Open Data Synthesis For Deep Research
Authors: Ziyi Xia, Kun Luo, Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple
factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions
into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence
from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers
as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are
fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP
formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)
fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often
introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural
depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for
synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to
recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring
intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into
natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also
enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,
and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that
models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a
challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass
much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash),
while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro).
By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels,
InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound
reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and
datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.

Title: GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV
  Cache Eviction
Authors: Xuelin Li, Xiangqi Jin, Linfeng Zhang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long
text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often
limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection
based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the
evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this,
we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for
KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance
scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a
decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by
propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the
most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in
existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a
plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

Title: The Resurgence of GCG Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models
Authors: Yuting Tan, Xuying Li, Zhuo Li, Huizhen Shu, and Peikang Hu
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.CR cs.LG
Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient
(GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large
language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG
and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying
scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack
effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and
reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1)
attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing
complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2)
prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness
compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more
realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more
vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself
can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with
T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and
achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under
semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the
scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning
tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for
more robust adversarial evaluation.

  Medical Literature
Authors: Juraj Vladika, Florian Matthes
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR
Comments: Accepted to CIKM 2025
\\
  In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical
advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it
has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading
information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year,
making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific
findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not
reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we
introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing
evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large
Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them
in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database
PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced
back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of
the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given
medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved
through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find
the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and
informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health
questions and advanced research insights.

Title: The Gold Medals in an Empty Room: Diagnosing Metalinguistic Reasoning in
  LLMs with Camlang
Authors: Fenghua Liu, Yulong Chen, Yixuan Liu, Zhujun Jin, Solomon Tsai, Ming
  Zhong
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Working in progress
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many
benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine
reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an
informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through
explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can
reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We
address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits
naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two
explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror
adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup,
and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and
sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are
sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang
tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang,
creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving
questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in
Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most
model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging
metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical
mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation
paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human
metalinguistic competence.

Title: GOSU: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Global-Level Optimized
  Semantic Unit-Centric Framework
Authors: Xuecheng Zou, Ke Liu, Bingbing Wang, Huafei Deng, Li Zhang, Yu Tang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich
retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple
entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a
key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is
prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to
the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework
that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture
interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the
graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs
from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing
the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic
objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce
hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former
uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while
the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from
the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms
the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of
heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper,
we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance
questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance
Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance,
and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate
Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based
LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an
accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent.
Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling
case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower
than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a
critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the
practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

Title: TECP: Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction for LLMs
Authors: Beining Xu
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints
where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce
Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages
token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and
integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct
prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches
that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP
directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of
sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to
ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language
models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP
consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets,
outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a
principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM
settings.

\\
  This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large
language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track
of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this
setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses
(over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona
(under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making
unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches
to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role
prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role
prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best
performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design
and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of
0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings
demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and
reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate
methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts,
we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

Authors: Li S. Yifei, Allen Chang, Chaitanya Malaviya, Mark Yatskar
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 11 pages main, 40 pages total, 16 figures
\\
  Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert
annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can
conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey
articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce
ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles
from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric,
derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer
evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing
limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of
queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be
addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are
able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with
expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18
systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented
system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the
highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that
the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric
items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our
data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

Title: Entropy-based Coarse and Compressed Semantic Speech Representation
  Learning
Authors: Jialong Zuo, Guangyan Zhang, Minghui Fang, Shengpeng Ji, Xiaoqi Jiao,
  Jingyu Li, Yiwen Guo, Zhou Zhao
Categories: cs.CL eess.AS
\\
  Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing
interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically
encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per
second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per
second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders
efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech
representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,
while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level
resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic
aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.
A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on
large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive
entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed
by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By
adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the
representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text
translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed
representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Modeling Motivated Reasoning in Law: Evaluating Strategic Role
  Conditioning in LLM Summarization
Authors: Eunjung Cho, Alexander Hoyle, Yoan Hermstr\"uwer
Categories: cs.CL cs.CY
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored
summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this
raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models
strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within
the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in
legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on
different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing
judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact
and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders.
Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models
exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives.
These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as
LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without
explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware
evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

Title: Thinking Hard, Going Misaligned: Emergent Misalignment in LLMs
Authors: Hanqi Yan, Hainiu Xu, Yulan He
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted,
concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have
intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and
malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more
concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe
that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is
strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math
datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze
internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized
experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards
safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging
reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment
for advanced reasoning models.

Title: StealthEval: A Probe-Rewrite-Evaluate Workflow for Reliable Benchmarks
Authors: Lang Xiong, Nishant Bhargava, Wesley Chang, Jianhang Hong, Haihao Liu,
  and Kevin Zhu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when
they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled
evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This
discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark
performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In
this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating
the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear
probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like"
and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more
natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using
this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a
strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of
state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that
rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in
behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest
responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses
of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,
indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that
evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly
influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or
deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent
need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model
alignment before deployment.

Title: Gated Associative Memory: A Parallel O(N) Architecture for Efficient
  Sequence Modeling
Authors: Rishiraj Acharya
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables
\\
  The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism,
has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core
computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)),
creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper,
we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel
architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with
respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer
with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local,
position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval
mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are
dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly
combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from
scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard
Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2
benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our
experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both
baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final
validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and
efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

Title: Can Multi-turn Self-refined Single Agent LMs with Retrieval Solve Hard
  Coding Problems?
Authors: Md Tanzib Hosain, Md Kishor Morol

  for Computational Linguistics (Student Research Workshop), 2025
\\
  Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming
where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and
the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it
has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC
benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest
(ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and
sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and
evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with
these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1
only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique,
which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over
episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new
human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining
difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems
that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few
specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and
algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative
research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

Title: Confident, Calibrated, or Complicit: Probing the Trade-offs between
  Safety Alignment and Ideological Bias in Language Models in Detecting Hate
  Speech
Authors: Sanjeeevan Selvaganapathy and Mehwish Nasim
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR
ACM-class: I.2.7; I.6
\\
  We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting
implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety
alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities
compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored
models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral
guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a
surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored
counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1%
strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own
limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making
censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models
prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify
critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as
irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across
different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders
self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs
as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing
frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

Title: Router Upcycling: Leveraging Mixture-of-Routers in Mixture-of-Experts
  Upcycling
Authors: Junfeng Ran, Guangxiang Zhao, Yuhan Wu, Dawei Zhu, Longyun Wu, Yikai

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep
learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance
across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains
challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve
existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this,
simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing
tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique
called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our
approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding
attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens
to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed
into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys).
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines.

Title: Do small language models generate realistic variable-quality fake news
  headlines?
Authors: Austin McCutcheon, Chris Brogly
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
\\
  Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may
potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14
SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and
Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news
headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to
real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000
headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive
categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline
quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news
headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical
resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality
detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed
that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only
ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs
generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are
slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not
closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the
low quality classification accuracy.

Title: Text Reinforcement for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting
Authors: Chen Su, Yuanhe Tian, Yan Song, Yongdong Zhang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such
as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These
studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual
information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising
results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series
inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture
the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable
performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the
textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we
propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose
a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses
potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to
support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving
TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced
text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on
the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF
model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as
to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF
performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering
various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which
outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

Title: CE-Bench: Towards a Reliable Contrastive Evaluation Benchmark of
  Interpretability of Sparse Autoencoders
Authors: Alex Gulko, Yusen Peng, Sachin Kumar
Categories: cs.CL

  Probing with sparse autoencoders is a promising approach for uncovering
interpretable features in large language models (LLMs). However, the lack of
automated evaluation methods has hindered their broader adoption and
development. In this work, we introduce CE-Bench, a novel and lightweight
contrastive evaluation benchmark for sparse autoencoders, built on a curated
dataset of contrastive story pairs. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies
to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that CE-Bench
reliably measures the interpretability of sparse autoencoders and aligns well
with existing benchmarks, all without requiring an external LLM. The official
implementation and evaluation dataset are open-sourced under the MIT License.

Title: Learning to Shop Like Humans: A Review-driven Retrieval-Augmented
  Recommendation Framework with LLMs
Authors: Kaiwen Wei, Jinpeng Gao, Jiang Zhong, Yuming Yang, Fengmao Lv,
  Zhenyang Li
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation
tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge
integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based
recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to
reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively
incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to
(1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained
context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews
most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these
challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework
inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in
online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based
reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate
items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce
PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item
representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves
preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive
experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves
consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its
generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.
Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse
offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews
influence the final recommendation.

Title: Reward-Weighted Sampling: Enhancing Non-Autoregressive Characteristics
  in Masked Diffusion LLMs
Authors: Daehoon Gwak, Minseo Jung, Junwoo Park, Minho Park, ChaeHun Park,

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: EMNLP 2025 Main Paper (Long)
\\
  Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive
alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs,
such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on
individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that
this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling
sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of
non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose
Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an
external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the
iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS
evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token
logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global
sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of
tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more
non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial
rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward.
Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive
generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.
These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in
enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of
MDMs.

Title: Designing LMS and Instructional Strategies for Integrating
  Generative-Conversational AI
Authors: Elias Ra, Seung Je Kim, Eui-Yeong Seo, Geunju So
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Higher education faces growing challenges in delivering personalized,
scalable, and pedagogically coherent learning experiences. This study
introduces a structured framework for designing an AI-powered Learning
Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to
support adaptive, interactive, and learner-centered instruction. Using a
design-based research (DBR) methodology, the framework unfolds through five
phases: literature review, SWOT analysis, development of ethical-pedagogical
principles, system design, and instructional strategy formulation. The
resulting AI-LMS features modular components -- including configurable prompts,
adaptive feedback loops, and multi-agent conversation flows -- aligned with
pedagogical paradigms such as behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist
learning theories. By combining AI capabilities with human-centered design and
ethical safeguards, this study advances a practical model for AI integration in
education. Future research will validate and refine the system through
real-world implementation.

Title: LLM Encoder vs. Decoder: Robust Detection of Chinese AI-Generated Text
  with LoRA
Authors: Houji Jin, Negin Ashrafi, Armin Abdollahi, Wei Liu, Jian Wang, Ganyu

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand
for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like
Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current
methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based
Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM
(Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank
Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset
from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models
were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach,
while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format
input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments
reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer
significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3%
test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical
robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In
contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with
balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and
resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the
efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust
Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation
Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance
cross-domain robustness further.

Title: Decomposing and Revising What Language Models Generate
Authors: Zhichao Yan, Jiaoyan Chen, Jiapu Wang, Xiaoli Li, Ru Li, Jeff Z. Pan
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models
(LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to
generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated
questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in
retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from
different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new
fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context
enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES
uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to
decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever
to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets
conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised
accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the
original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets,
with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating
the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in
average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

Title: LegalChainReasoner: A Legal Chain-guided Framework for Criminal Judicial
  Opinion Generation
Authors: Weizhe Shi, Qiqi Wang, Yihong Pan, Qian Liu, Kaiqi Zhao
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case,
including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such
opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with
references to similar past cases. However, current research typically
approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning
and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between
the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial
requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to
enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment.
To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a
new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces
both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce
LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide
the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual
premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach
ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.
Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question
answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their
performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before
deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper
presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task,
which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases,
genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging
LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled
from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental
setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short
answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain
understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their
Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test
phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer
extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics.
Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly
formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic
understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications,
motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

Title: TMT: A Simple Way to Translate Topic Models Using Dictionaries
Authors: Felix Engl, Andreas Henrich
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures, 8 tables
ACM-class: I.2.7; H.3.1
\\
  The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging
task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and
manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the
developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an
environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual
corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a
novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models
(e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language
to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT
enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially
suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are
unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT
extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that
it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

  The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their
evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this
important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12,
Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level,
dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small
models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main
strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting,
and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations
with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only
by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly
fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the
validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is
important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly
different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and
validation sets.

  Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing
tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense
vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of
(query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the
negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to
discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels
of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine
curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding
model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile,
we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher
weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs,
improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity.
Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods
achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies
both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

\\
  Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying
harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an
image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of
occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse,
Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models:
closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable
Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against
fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity.
All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black,
White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that
prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly
model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect
into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These
findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a
fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level
strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in
language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive
and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de
facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where
the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over
accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in
various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive
decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design
two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for
the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the
collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations
across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output
distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD
can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without
requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the
factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have
achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the
conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key
limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful
information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in
multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address
these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that
introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly
reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose
Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only
answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when
no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by
the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates
whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide
the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of
noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that
EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy,
generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves
state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding
relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and
91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

  Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and
critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for
factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more
granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news
articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for
Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset
comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains,
including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent
progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing
literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various
tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs
in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline
transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these
models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new
research directions.

Title: Supervised In-Context Fine-Tuning for Generative Sequence Labeling
Authors: David Duki\'c, Goran Glava\v{s}, Jan \v{S}najder
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are
abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment
analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL
tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows
that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to
become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)
generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid
scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose
own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context
fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained
response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL)
from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably
outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of
standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the
performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be
mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely
unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings
highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the
importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL
performance.

\\
  We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed
to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating
domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD
integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance
structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999
English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with
structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B,
Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that
incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived
definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all
models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23,
chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o
and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model
adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their
combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the
potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical
translation tasks.

  The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been
shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the
other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm
leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors
and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm
centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and
model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence,
this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms.
Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both
paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure,
through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization
to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general
knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable
intelligent systems.

Title: RPRO:Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization for Enhancing Medical
  QA and Diagnostic Reasoning
Authors: Chia-Hsuan Hsu, Jun-En Ding, Hsin-Ling Hsu, Feng Liu, Fang-Ming Hung
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain
knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models
(LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical
reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a
novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with
preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought
(CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by
employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation
mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while
automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike
traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking
optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence
regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE
show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B
parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including
medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining
preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and
effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

  The demand for text classification is growing significantly in web searching,
data mining, web ranking, recommendation systems, and so many other fields of
information and technology. This paper illustrates the text classification
process on different datasets using some standard supervised machine learning
techniques. Text documents can be classified through various kinds of
classifiers. Labeled text documents are used to classify the text in supervised
classifications. This paper applies these classifiers on different kinds of
labeled documents and measures the accuracy of the classifiers. An Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) model using Back Propagation Network (BPN) is used with
several other models to create an independent platform for labeled and
supervised text classification process. An existing benchmark approach is used
to analyze the performance of classification using labeled documents.
Experimental analysis on real data reveals which model works well in terms of
classification accuracy.

  Ranking words is an important way to summarize a text or to retrieve
information. A word graph is a way to represent the words of a sentence or a
text as the vertices of a graph and to show the relationship among the words.
It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the
words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are
calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various
graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word
database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which
has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts
of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking
algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps
are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms
to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire
procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the
construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real
data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

\\
  Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific
communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus
on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a
sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty,
and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We
introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of
taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social
interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five
frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy
rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate.
Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language
prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses
rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the
limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning
and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in
model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33
participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers)
forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work
lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling
applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

  In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

  Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech
to health misinformation.

  This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We
assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice
questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models'
ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of
shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant
performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas
ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect
important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a
detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models,
including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of
legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight
limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for
improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning. Code:

Title: A Paradigm Gap in Urdu
Authors: Farah Adeeba, Rajesh Bhatt
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities
of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction
(e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and
Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate
this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus
study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective
evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly
unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic
conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an
invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive
perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form
unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap
to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

  Retrieval Augmented Generation
Authors: Jinwen Chen and Hainan Zhang and Liang Pang and Yongxin Tong and Haibo
  Zhou and Yuan Zhan and Wei Lin and Zhiming Zheng
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud,
risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding
documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.
However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and
fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,
leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies
solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,
resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,
achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level
performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In
this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled
parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and
parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and
multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the
plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a
parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,
guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard
RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without
original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG
outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

Title: REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding
Authors: Xiaoqiang Lin, Aritra Ghosh, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, Anshumali

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and
agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and
demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced
throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system
efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary
objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In
RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,
with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often
exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during
re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those
in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most
computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be
eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,
an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve
latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we
demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to
previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization
framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs
by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context
tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document
summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm
that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to
LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

Title: Natural Context Drift Undermines the Natural Language Understanding of
  Large Language Models
Authors: Yulong Wu, Viktor Schlegel and Riza Batista-Navarro
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: EMNLP 2025 Findings
\\
  How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question
answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we
propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of
reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM
performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how
closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this
framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available
training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading
passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during
pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains
present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops
by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding
70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution
poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of
LLMs.

  We present Dream-Coder 7B, an open-source discrete diffusion language model
for code generation that exhibits emergent any-order generation capabilities.
Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly
left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based
on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms,
left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved
reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR
checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted
cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised
fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a
padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality
prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement
learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B
Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates
competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We
release Dream-Coder-7B and Dream-Coder-7B-Instruct checkpoints, training
recipes, preprocessing pipelines, and inference code to facilitate
reproducibility and further research.

Comments: EMNLP 2025
\\
  Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge
from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing
zero-shot CL-NER (ZCL-NER) approaches primarily focus on Latin script language
(LSL), where shared linguistic features facilitate effective knowledge
transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and
Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To
address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT)
approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a
dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In
addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the
entity alignment from source to target languages.

advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing
methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural
language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate
instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and
time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel
framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.
Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align
graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive
learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in
performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph
instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results
on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link
prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

Title: Modular Techniques for Synthetic Long-Context Data Generation in
  Language Model Training and Evaluation
Authors: Seganrasan Subramanian, Abhigya Verma
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 15 pages, 4 figures
\\
  The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long
textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications.
However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of
high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both
training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework
for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with
LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core
generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded
input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context
reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture,
and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable,
controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context
capabilities in LLMs.

Title: Statutory Construction and Interpretation for Artificial Intelligence

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.CY
\\
  AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a
key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored:
interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how
these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems
use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent
appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines
offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can
lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we
identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems
constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We
then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a
rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising
ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative
action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce
inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide
judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of
the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve
judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach
offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an
essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

Title: Efficient Large Language Models with Zero-Shot Adjustable Acceleration

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Using Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications presents
significant challenges, particularly in balancing computational efficiency and
performance. Optimizing acceleration after the fine-tuning phase and during
inference is crucial for building an efficient architecture. This paper
introduces Zero-Shot Adjustable Acceleration, a novel training and inference
method that dynamically adjusts hardware usage during inference without
requiring additional fine-tuning. The proposed approach is applied to newly
developed models and evaluated across multiple classification and text
generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the method enables a
wide range of acceleration in a zero-shot manner and achieves up to a 11x
speedup compared to the baseline.

Title: SimulMEGA: MoE Routers are Advanced Policy Makers for Simultaneous
  Speech Translation
Authors: Chenyang Le, Bing Han, Jinshun Li, Songyong Chen, Yanmin Qian
Categories: cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS
\\
  Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual
communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation
under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance
translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in
multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies
hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA
(Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy
learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a
Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an
implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires
only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and
generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks.
Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter
speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7
percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3
seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to
streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality
tradeoffs.

Title: Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning through Model
  Growth
Authors: Ege S\"ualp and Mina Rezaei
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in
which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This
problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing
continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is
important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a
promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the
training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.
Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has
shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains
under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain
previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of
fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,
and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack
LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.
However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating
signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less
degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention
capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes
progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM
maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that
growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting
catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

Title: DaMoC: Efficiently Selecting the Optimal Large Language Model for
  Fine-tuning Domain Taks Based on Data and Model Compression
Authors: Wei Huang, Huang Wei, Yinggui Wang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Accepted by EMNLP 2025
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with
domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many
open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream
tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal
LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses
this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering
methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three
distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,
and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the
density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we
use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model
Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and
remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging
paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.
Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general
Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while
saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

Title: Rethinking the Chain-of-Thought: The Roles of In-Context Learning and
  Pre-trained Priors
Authors: Hao Yang, Zhiyu Yang, Yunjie Zhang, Shanyi Zhu, Lin Yang

DOI: 10.1007/978-981-95-0020-8_34
\\
  Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing
model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the
working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the
dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first
conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the
model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars,
we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous
in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can
induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal
three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning
structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning
patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient
exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to
in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long
Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning
chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

  Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in
society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual
manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated
following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which
is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements
traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit
significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable
statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we
demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that
variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our
results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional
situations based on evaluative criteria.

Title: Culture is Everywhere: A Call for Intentionally Cultural Evaluation
Authors: Juhyun Oh, Inha Cha, Michael Saxon, Hyunseung Lim, Shaily Bhatt, Alice
  Oh
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural
alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these
models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically
reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or
short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods
neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how
cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings.
In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural
evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions
embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks.
We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which
culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the
importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally
aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions
for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important
applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation
design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

  Question Answering
Authors: Sishi Xiong, Ziyang He, Zhongjiang He, Yu Zhao, Changzai Pan, Jie
  Zhang, Zhenhe Wu, Shuangyong Song, Yongxiang Li
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question
answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in
industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in
target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address
these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered,
programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1)
replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to
bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware
table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through
column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target
localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that
transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination.
Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to
enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing
performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented
with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of
19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench
dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset,
respectively.

Title: Can Smaller LLMs do better? Unlocking Cross-Domain Potential through
  Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Text Summarization
Authors: Anum Afzal, Mehul Kumawat, Florian Matthes
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile.
However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are
speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally,
the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging
when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is
unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on
high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on
unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether
intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for
efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with
\texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific,
Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments
show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can
achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger
\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain
Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the
strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities
across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in
low-resource settings.

  We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic
capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash
adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic
computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per
token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)
Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap
window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput
compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling
framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth
initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation
to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy
among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete
model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving
over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million
output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we
conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted
mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further
augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers
highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional
strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is
open-sourced to foster community research.

Title: KoBLEX: Open Legal Question Answering with Multi-hop Reasoning

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP 2025 Main Conference
\\
  Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general
domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks
have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these
benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question
Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal
EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop
legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their
supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We
also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval
(ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally
grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on
complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a
three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the
legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation
(LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question,
answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human
judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms
strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably,
compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1
and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently
delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations
confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress
of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have
defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal
attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models
(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the
question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this
paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We
systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse
card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,
and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while
mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the
performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality
data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with
performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for
dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when
mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a
certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate
strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

Title: Reasoning Vectors: Transferring Chain-of-Thought Capabilities via Task
  Arithmetic
Authors: Mohammad Zbeeb, Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud, Bernard Ghanem
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Under Review
\\
  Large language models often require costly optimization, such as
reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work
demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and
transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly
available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning
vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We
hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by
reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT
process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple
arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse
reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and
BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist
under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes
significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the
vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work
shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive
training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through
simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by
recycling prior computational investments.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Online harms are a growing problem in digital spaces, putting user safety at
risk and reducing trust in social media platforms. One of the most persistent
forms of harm is hate speech. To address this, we need tools that combine the
speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human
moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain
their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this
paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in
tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent
system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It
compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses
a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and
informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates
chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and
support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect
hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both
precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method
surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91.
Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce
online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

\\
  Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many
application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by
the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of
cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic
framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating
cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and
validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used
to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing
linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human
evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We
apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show
that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from
human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our
framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across
application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for
numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the
code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit
language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with
measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved
performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer
insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of
more effective generative speech models.

Title: LLMs cannot spot math errors, even when allowed to peek into the
  solution

  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word
problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such
as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the
challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two
error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student
solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we
propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution,
aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve
performance.

  Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and
control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a
human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive
reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps,
and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined
premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active
collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy
conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer
accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user
study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points
to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative
reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

Title: On the Alignment of Large Language Models with Global Human Opinion
Authors: Yang Liu, Masahiro Kaneko, Chenhui Chu
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 23 pages, 19 figures
\\
  Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual
scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When
LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align
with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by
the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies
mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic
groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country
samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well
as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also
overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs'
opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create
an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to
systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across
different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We
find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few
countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore,
changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the
questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the
corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the
same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary
population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive
investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global,
language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at

  Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when
not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous
uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency
dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a
calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error
budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with
temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through
black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal
risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic
fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved
evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage.
Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and
retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration
metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed
risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and
end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction,
semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of
abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a
portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled
decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and
remains valid under distribution shift.

Title: Robust Knowledge Editing via Explicit Reasoning Chains for
  Distractor-Resilient Multi-Hop QA
Authors: Yuchen Wu, Liang Ding, Li Shen, Dacheng Tao
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP 2025 Findings
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but
remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts
prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have
thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either
over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that
collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an
end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM
through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination,
selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single
pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates
Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop
under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative
analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

Comments: under review
\\
  Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet
factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are
primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval
Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current
research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while
overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study,
we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know?
Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated
regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the
influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs
exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal
post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware
Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that
the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified
by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with
the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal
method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality
in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more
comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM
systems.

Title: MeVe: A Modular System for Memory Verification and Effective Context
  Control in Language Models
Authors: Andreas Ottem
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 16 pages, 7 figures, held online presentation at NLPA 2025
\\
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints
because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The
approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant
information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This
paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory
Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by
proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval
and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently
tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,
context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables
fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling
task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation
of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy
QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that
by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly
improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset
and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard
RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and
reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information,
MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support
[16].

Title: Service, Solidarity, and Self-Help: A Comparative Topic Modeling
  Analysis of Community Unionism in the Boot and Shoe Union and Unite Community
Authors: Thomas Compton
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures, conference paper
\\
  This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two
distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe
Union (B\&S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using
BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency
analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns
with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement,
and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in
thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates
stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the
B\&S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and
member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union
model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how
modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives.
Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with
community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge
significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of
community unionism across time and sector.

Title: CAT: Causal Attention Tuning For Injecting Fine-grained Causal Knowledge
  into Large Language Models
Authors: Kairong Han, Wenshuo Zhao, Ziyu Zhao, JunJian Ye, Lujia Pan, Kun Kuang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP2025 Main conference
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize
causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we
find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious
correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal
performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that
injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose
an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate
token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide
training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise
and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious
Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our
approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains
robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at

Title: In-N-Out: A Parameter-Level API Graph Dataset for Tool Agents
Authors: Seungkyu Lee, Nalim Kim, Yohan Jo
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a
way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex,
these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper
order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into
a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for
multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we
introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from
two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out
significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query
generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover,
graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap,
showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and
parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit
API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource.
We will release the dataset and code publicly.

Title: Enhancing Uncertainty Estimation in LLMs with Expectation of Aggregated
  Internal Belief
Authors: Zeguan Xiao, Diyang Dou, Boya Xiong, Yun Chen, Guanhua Chen
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate
plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models
undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant
challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this
paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel
self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden
states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on
the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple
intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise
beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score
distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully
reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration
performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
EAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of
the impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of
self-evaluation score range.

MSC-class: 68T50

\\
  Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce
contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into
the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are
close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words
corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that
are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for
sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and
show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their
relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings,
as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random
token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the
distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on
linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same
information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions
shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence
embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks.
Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different
dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding
space.

Title: Benchmarking the Detection of LLMs-Generated Modern Chinese Poetry

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Accepted by EMNLP 2025
\\
  The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made
AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on
detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved
modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese
poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or
AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly
disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying
AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel
benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first
construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six
professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.
Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on
this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be
used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The
most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially
style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of
AI-generated poetry.

Title: TransGAT: Transformer-Based Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Dimensional
  Automated Essay Scoring
Authors: Hind Aljuaid, Areej Alhothali, Ohoud Al-Zamzami, Hussein Assalahi
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual
scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent
studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static
word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for
polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,
overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.
To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach
that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.
TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the
relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs
two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,
and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates
essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token
embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then
fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.
Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline
models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all
analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT
to advance AES systems.

identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic

Title: Bridging Thoughts and Words: Graph-Based Intent-Semantic Joint Learning
  for Fake News Detection
Authors: Zhengjia Wang, Qiang Sheng, Danding Wang, Beizhe Hu, Juan Cao
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to CIKM'25
\\
  Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online
information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract
news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,
stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues
can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in
dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news
landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective
by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and
semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one
can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than
the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose
Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,
which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via
graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and
intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context
interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and
implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve
better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic
pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and
aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: chDzDT: Word-level morphology-aware language model for Algerian social
  media text
Authors: Abdelkrime Aries
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
ACM-class: I.2.7
\\
  Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural
language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.
However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated
models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex
morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical
influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization
and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained
language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that
rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design
allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending
on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from
diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber
Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and
linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of
Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a
multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive
evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for
downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of
character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and
lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

Title: Flaw or Artifact? Rethinking Prompt Sensitivity in Evaluating LLMs
Authors: Andong Hua, Kenan Tang, Chenhe Gu, Jindong Gu, Eric Wong, Yao Qin
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference
\\
  Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e.,
repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to
significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely
accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and
ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness
of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this
question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)
across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12
diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems
from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid
answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed
through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance
variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across
prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt
templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an
artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

  Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI
interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in
real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when
such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within
quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of
AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems
across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition,
answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to
probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI
interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and
qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited
emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the
utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be
context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

Title: Extracting OPQRST in Electronic Health Records using Large Language
  Models with Reasoning
Authors: Zhimeng Luo, Abhibha Gupta, Adam Frisch, Daqing He
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured
nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to
capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to
utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel
approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task
from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide
reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach
enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled
data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of
evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by
proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics.
This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT
Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent
of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant
advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that
improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs,
thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing
patient care outcomes.

Title: Weakly Supervised Medical Entity Extraction and Linking for Chief
  Complaints
Authors: Zhimeng Luo, Zhendong Wang, Rui Meng, Diyang Xue, Adam Frisch, Daqing
  He
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the
patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a
patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text
mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering
methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it
difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record
keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to
automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of
human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak
annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million
real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we
train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions
in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted
extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity
Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over
previous methods without any human annotation.

  Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation,
insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a
specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of
disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the
parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often
favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such
disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two
specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist
identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or
disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured
dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then
explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to
assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are
prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i)
identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each
specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate
whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate
the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant
baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

Title: StructCoh: Structured Contrastive Learning for Context-Aware Text
  Semantic Matching
Authors: Chao Xue and Ziyuan Gao
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted by PRICAI 2025
\\
  Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural
relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained
language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often
overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic
discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced
contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural
reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key
innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency
parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to
propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document
concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at
multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core
semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document
structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling
strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and
academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score
(+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying
argument structure similarities.

  Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet
their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains
inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured
clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs'
reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a
model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the
competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini
2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal
dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized
longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we
assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by
licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating
superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert
ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising
readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis,
endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and
research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

Title: Attributes as Textual Genes: Leveraging LLMs as Genetic Algorithm
  Simulators for Conditional Synthetic Data Generation
Authors: Guangzeng Han and Weisi Liu and Xiaolei Huang
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP2025 Findings
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring
its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a
novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic
data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences
and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This
genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute
combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To
optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that
expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks
reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various
generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our
synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream
model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings
validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality
synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

Title: How Instruction-Tuning Imparts Length Control: A Cross-Lingual
  Mechanistic Analysis
Authors: Elisabetta Rocchetti, Alfio Ferrara
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
ACM-class: I.2.7
\\
  Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a
precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation
models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text
generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal
component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived
from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning
substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in
deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models
show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian,
while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a
stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results
indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence,
with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

Title: Better by Comparison: Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Reasoning for
  Automatic Prompt Optimization
Authors: Juhyeon Lee, Wonduk Seo, Hyunjin An, Seunghyun Lee, Yi Bu
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR
Comments: Preprint
\\
  Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for
improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the
goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work
focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the
potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from
contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt
Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a
retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference
prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for
helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs
two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,
where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own
generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive
reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation
dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By
explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model
to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more
robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2
benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our
findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning
for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential
step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The
current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them
with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers
controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited
interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in
verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely
determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address
these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic
evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm.
JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark
grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes
knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment
methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective
evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating
evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its
dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

Title: CMRAG: Co-modality-based document retrieval and visual question
  answering
Authors: Wang Chen, Guanqiang Qi, Weikang Li, Yang Li
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document
question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when
dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout
analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information
and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category
treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual
language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages
of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes
co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and
images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform
structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text
segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we
retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and
aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt
the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval
results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings
of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG
framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the
performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases
present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In
the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal
that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most
existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these
local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian
vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM
outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to
17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the
AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any
parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding
algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during
generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding
process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and
infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative
decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In
this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased
generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as
the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust
trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a
fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of
bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and
results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

  Low-Resource Philippine Languages
Authors: David Demitri Africa, Suchir Salhan, Yuval Weiss, Paula Buttery,

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled
by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible
in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs
can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to
languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the
autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML).
Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in
their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed.
Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp
under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence
time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that
co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of
surface anchors.

Title: Avoidance Decoding for Diverse Multi-Branch Story Generation
Authors: Kyeongman Park, Nakyeong Yang, Kyomin Jung
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous
outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative
diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token
logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby
encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances
two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is
prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2)
Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to
ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to
2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30%
compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration.
Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons,
demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

  Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from
well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and
high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of
linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic
model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language
Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent
models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models
ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic
competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our
findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge
improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster,
suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core
language ability. These results support a modular approach to language
modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the
foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward
more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

Title: LLMs and their Limited Theory of Mind: Evaluating Mental State
  Annotations in Situated Dialogue
Authors: Katharine Kowalyshyn, Matthias Scheutz
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also
expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team
members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team
dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated
discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an
LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented
dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a
secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations
against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define
an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six
CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM
annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3)
an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal
that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward
natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios
requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

Title: DCPO: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization
Authors: Shihui Yang, Chengfeng Dou, Peidong Guo, Kai Lu, Qiang Ju, Fei Deng,

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero
gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for
token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards,
which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of
generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy
Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that
adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior
probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage
standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training
steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated
responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based
on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under
greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24
benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the
Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO
achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO
(20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the
nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency
over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of
magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance.
These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more
efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a
wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step
problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent
studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward
implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures
without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings
advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better
alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed
latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and
mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs
remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered
on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to
computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution
paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation
unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent
execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based
evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further
provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in
existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit
reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at:

Title: Towards Temporal Knowledge-Base Creation for Fine-Grained Opinion
  Analysis with Language Models
Authors: Gaurav Negi, Atul Kr. Ojha, Omnia Zayed, Paul Buitelaar
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge
base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the
demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream
applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies
underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded
fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating
well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation
pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt
engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion
mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform
rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test
samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and
inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained
opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting
knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible
with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question
answering, and timeline summarisation.

Title: An Ensemble Classification Approach in A Multi-Layered Large Language
  Model Framework for Disease Prediction
Authors: Ali Hamdi, Malak Mohamed, Rokaia Emad and Khaled Shaban
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing
patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely.
Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms,
creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease
classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along
with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities
in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic
medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
(CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a
majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and
preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best
classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging
various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding
of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth
data.

Title: EmoPerso: Enhancing Personality Detection with Self-Supervised
  Emotion-Aware Modelling
Authors: Lingzhi Shen, Xiaohao Cai, Yunfei Long, Imran Razzak, Guanming Chen,

Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users'
social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality
labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent
variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection
through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms
for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then
extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with
personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is
employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and
the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning,
EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning
capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is
available at https://github.com/slz0925/EmoPerso.

\\
  Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely
on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct
controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general
and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated,
LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that
while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their
integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor
consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.
Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general
tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.
These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs
process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

Title: SpecEval: Evaluating Model Adherence to Behavior Specifications
Authors: Ahmed Ahmed, Kevin Klyman, Yi Zeng, Sanmi Koyejo, Percy Liang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they
pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do
so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published
detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and
qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of
adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits
models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements,
generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central
focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model
outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator
validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a
foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral
specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our
framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral
statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up
to 20 percent across providers.

  Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by
a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models.
Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental
challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data.
Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but
existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward
models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages
unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this
approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce
not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$
can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a
wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support
downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward
tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement
learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers
strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative
baselines.

Title: MoSEs: Uncertainty-Aware AI-Generated Text Detection via Mixture of
  Stylistics Experts with Conditional Thresholds
Authors: Junxi Wu and Jinpeng Wang and Zheng Liu and Bin Chen and Dongjian Hu
  and Hao Wu and Shu-Tao Xiu
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: EMNLP 2025
\\
  The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public
concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build
trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect
stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits
the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic
Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty
quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three
core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the
Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE).
For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and
provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic
statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the
optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels
with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average
improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More
inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource
case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

Title: L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID: A Dataset for Headline Identification and
  Semantic Evaluation in Low-Resource Indian Languages
Authors: Nishant Tanksale, Tanmay Kokate, Darshan Gohad, Sarvadnyaa Barate,
  Raviraj Joshi
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in
NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource
settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack
of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten
low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada,
Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000
news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically
similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to
test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the
correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We
benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and
language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that
multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models
vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a
valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such
applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice
question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations
of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP. The dataset is shared

Title: The Forgotten Code: Validating a Century-Old Translation System with AI
Authors: Jean-Marie Le Ray
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Preprint, 35 pages, 14 figures, 9 appendices
ACM-class: I.2
\\
  A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern
RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci,
who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico
ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria
lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI
breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised
by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first
step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's
method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly
documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated
from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from
French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years
apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low
average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system
thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in
English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were
consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating
more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an
invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond
its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible
experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical
status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to
machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as
Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history
of the field is understood.

Title: Top-H Decoding: Adapting the Creativity and Coherence with Bounded
  Entropy in Text Generation
Authors: Erfan Baghaei Potraghloo, Seyedarmin Azizi, Souvik Kundu, Massoud

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a
wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in
open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving
logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including
temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim
to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in
the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the
corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a
single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the
information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of
the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We
first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity
and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained
minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be
equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,
which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally
efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)
alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing
benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as
GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms
that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where
creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in
open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing
applications. The code is available at
https://github.com/ErfanBaghaei/Top-H-Decoding.

Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English
(Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure,
transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a
comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed
multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained
on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained
on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google
Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER
tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using
Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,
particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform
others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to
domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show
limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot
performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study
provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized
models for code-mixed NER tasks.

Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have
empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks
such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards
to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output
quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR
paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from
sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in
RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a
novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor
$\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By
treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR
problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by
the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient
analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the
classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic
roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging
mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as
PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS
achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32
and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a
promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and
data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.

  We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages.
Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual
counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge
this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters),
training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality
human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior
performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the
comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small
model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium
model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size,
enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited
support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

Comments: 29 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and
helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while
post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions
and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and
exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We
address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a
framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.
At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure
diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is
then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,
encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.
Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING
generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and
creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks
in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL
baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and
novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution
quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing
for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as
higher-quality responses.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions
they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly
sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards
high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,
LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap
that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.
This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented
topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first
shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these
specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General
Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range
of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and
language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew
considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for
Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our
findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance
over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15%
on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among
participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be
domain-dependent.

  The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

  We present ARTPS (Autonomous Rover Target Prioritization System), a novel
hybrid AI system that combines depth estimation, anomaly detection, and
learnable curiosity scoring for autonomous exploration of planetary surfaces.
Our approach integrates monocular depth estimation using Vision Transformers
with multi-component anomaly detection and a weighted curiosity score that
balances known value, anomaly signals, depth variance, and surface roughness.
The system achieves state-of-the-art performance with AUROC of 0.94, AUPRC of
0.89, and F1-Score of 0.87 on Mars rover datasets. We demonstrate significant
improvements in target prioritization accuracy through ablation studies and
provide comprehensive analysis of component contributions. The hybrid fusion
approach reduces false positives by 23% while maintaining high detection
sensitivity across diverse terrain types.

  This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

Title: MESTI-MEGANet: Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image and
  Micro-expression Gradient Attention Networks for Micro-expression Recognition
Authors: Luu Tu Nguyen, Vu Tram Anh Khuong, Thanh Ha Le, Thi Duyen Ngo
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

Title: Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation
  with Discrete Diffusion
Authors: Justin Jung
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

Title: Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing
Authors: Anas M. Ali, Anis Koubaa, and Bilel Benjdira
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

  assessment studies

Categories: cs.CV eess.IV q-bio.QM
\\
  Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Title: Waste-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating VLLMs in Cluttered

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of
visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance
on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly
explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having
deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset
specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios,
characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with
this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess
the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive
analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under
challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further
advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments.
The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.

\\
  This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

Title: Safe-LLaVA: A Privacy-Preserving Vision-Language Dataset and Benchmark
  for Biometric Safety
Authors: Younggun Kim, Sirnam Swetha, Fazil Kagdi, Mubarak Shah
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,

Title: Beyond Pixels: Introducing Geometric-Semantic World Priors for
  Video-based Embodied Models via Spatio-temporal Alignment
Authors: Jinzhou Tang, Jusheng zhang, Sidi Liu, Waikit Xiu, Qinhan Lv, Xiying

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

\\
  Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

  Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark

GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using
datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against
convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

  Vision 2025 (ICMV 2025)
\\
  The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

  Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

Title: Language-Aware Information Maximization for Transductive Few-Shot CLIP
Authors: Ghassen Baklouti, Maxime Zanella and Ismail Ben Ayed
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

Title: MorphGen: Morphology-Guided Representation Learning for Robust
  Single-Domain Generalization in Histopathological Cancer Classification
Authors: Hikmat Khan, Syed Farhan Alam Zaidi, Pir Masoom Shah, Kiruthika
  Balakrishnan, Rabia Khan, Muhammad Waqas, and Jia Wu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

Title: Towards Adaptive Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models
Authors: Hao Zhang, Mengsi Lyu, Chenrui He, Yulong Ao, Yonghua Lin
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

  Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

  Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Title: Target-Oriented Single Domain Generalization
Authors: Marzi Heidari, Yuhong Guo
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

  Air pollution monitoring in resource-constrained regions remains challenging
due to sparse sensor deployment and limited infrastructure. This work
introduces AQFusionNet, a multimodal deep learning framework for robust Air
Quality Index (AQI) prediction. The framework integrates ground-level
atmospheric imagery with pollutant concentration data using lightweight CNN
backbones (MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNet-B0). Visual and sensor features
are combined through semantically aligned embedding spaces, enabling accurate
and efficient prediction. Experiments on more than 8,000 samples from India and
Nepal demonstrate that AQFusionNet consistently outperforms unimodal baselines,
achieving up to 92.02% classification accuracy and an RMSE of 7.70 with the
EfficientNet-B0 backbone. The model delivers an 18.5% improvement over
single-modality approaches while maintaining low computational overhead, making
it suitable for deployment on edge devices. AQFusionNet provides a scalable and
practical solution for AQI monitoring in infrastructure-limited environments,
offering robust predictive capability even under partial sensor availability.

Title: Iterative Low-rank Network for Hyperspectral Image Denoising
Authors: Jin Ye, Fengchao Xiong, Jun Zhou, and Yuntao Qian

Journal-ref: TGRS 2024
DOI: 10.1109/TGRS.2024.3449130
\\
  Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

\\
  Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

  We describe a publicly available multimodal dataset of annotated Positron
Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) studies for head and neck
cancer research. The dataset includes 1123 FDG-PET/CT studies from patients
with histologically confirmed head and neck cancer, acquired from 10
international medical centers. All examinations consisted of co-registered
PET/CT scans with varying acquisition protocols, reflecting real-world clinical
diversity across institutions. Primary gross tumor volumes (GTVp) and involved
lymph nodes (GTVn) were manually segmented by experienced radiation oncologists
and radiologists following standardized guidelines and quality control
measures. We provide anonymized NifTi files of all studies, along with
expert-annotated segmentation masks, radiotherapy dose distribution for a
subset of patients, and comprehensive clinical metadata. This metadata includes
TNM staging, HPV status, demographics (age and gender), long-term follow-up
outcomes, survival times, censoring indicators, and treatment information. We
demonstrate how this dataset can be used for three key clinical tasks:
automated tumor segmentation, recurrence-free survival prediction, and HPV
status classification, providing benchmark results using state-of-the-art deep
learning models, including UNet, SegResNet, and multimodal prognostic
frameworks.

Title: Two Causes, Not One: Rethinking Omission and Fabrication Hallucinations
  in MLLMs
Authors: Guangzong Si, Hao Yin, Xianfei Li, Qing Ding, Wenlong Liao, Tao He,
  Pai Peng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Preprint,Underreview
\\
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

Title: Activation Steering Meets Preference Optimization: Defense Against
  Jailbreaks in Vision Language Models
Authors: Sihao Wu, Gaojie Jin, Wei Huang, Jianhong Wang, Xiaowei Huang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

Title: Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning: Fine-Tuning Heterogeneous Foundation
  Models for 3D Point Cloud Analysis
Authors: Mengke Li, Lihao Chen, Peng Zhang, Yiu-ming Cheung, Hui Huang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

Title: NoiseCutMix: A Novel Data Augmentation Approach by Mixing Estimated
  Noise in Diffusion Models
Authors: Shumpei Takezaki, Ryoma Bise, Shinnosuke Matsuo
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at ICCV2025 Workshop LIMIT
\\
  In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

Title: Domain Adaptation-Based Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation for 3D
  Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Jialiang Kang, Jiawen Wang, Dingsheng Luo
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
Comments: ICRA 2025
\\
  Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

Title: Visually Grounded Narratives: Reducing Cognitive Burden in
  Researcher-Participant Interaction
Authors: Runtong Wu, Jiayao Song, Fei Teng, Xianhao Ren, Yuyan Gao, Kailun Yang
Categories: cs.CV cs.HC
\\
  Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

Comments: Accepted to BMVC 2025 (Oral), 23 pages with supplementary material
\\
  In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

Title: Double-Constraint Diffusion Model with Nuclear Regularization for
  Ultra-low-dose PET Reconstruction
Authors: Mengxiao Geng, Ran Hong, Bingxuan Li, Qiegen Liu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

Title: DAOVI: Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting
Authors: Ryosuke Seshimo, Mariko Isogawa
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: BMVC 2025
\\
  Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

  Virtual Perspective
Authors: Yushuo Chen, Ruizhi Shao, Youxin Pang, Hongwen Zhang, Xinyi Wu, Rihui
  Wu, Yebin Liu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

Title: LightVLM: Acceleraing Large Multimodal Models with Pyramid Token Merging
  and KV Cache Compression
Authors: Lianyu Hu, Fanhua Shang, Wei Feng, Liang Wan
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: EMNLP2025 Findings
\\
  In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by

  Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

Title: SemaMIL: Semantic Reordering with Retrieval-Guided State Space Modeling
  for Whole Slide Image Classification
Authors: Lubin Gan, Xiaoman Wu, Jing Zhang, Zhifeng Wang, Linhao Qu, Siying Wu,
  Xiaoyan Sun
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

Title: Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution for Facial Age Estimation
Authors: Bo Wu, Zhiqi Ai, Jun Jiang, Congcong Zhu, Shugong Xu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 14 pages, 3 fugures
\\
  Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

Title: Encoder-Only Image Registration
Authors: Xiang Chen, Renjiu Hu, Jinwei Zhang, Yuxi Zhang, Xinyao Yue, Min Liu,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on
https://github.com/XiangChen1994/EOIR.

Title: VideoRewardBench: Comprehensive Evaluation of Multimodal Reward Models
  for Video Understanding
Authors: Zhihong Zhang, Xiaojian Huang, Jin Xu, Zhuodong Luo, Xinzhi Wang,

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: https://videorewardbench.github.io/
\\
  Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

Title: Multi-Focused Video Group Activities Hashing

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

  Adaptation

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to APSIPA ASC 2025
\\
  Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

\\
  The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

Title: Learning Yourself: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation with
  Language-Inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement
Authors: Ruitao Wu, Yifan Zhao, Jia Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by ICCV 2025
\\
  Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

  Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Title: DGL-RSIS: Decoupling Global Spatial Context and Local Class Semantics
  for Training-Free Remote Sensing Image Segmentation
Authors: Boyi Li, Ce Zhang, Richard M. Timmerman, Wenxuan Bao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing
  (TGRS), under review
\\
  The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

  Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We

those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter

  While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP

  Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically

require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

Title: Fusion to Enhance: Fusion Visual Encoder to Enhance Multimodal Language
  Model
Authors: Yifei She and Huangxuan Wu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

Title: ER-LoRA: Effective-Rank Guided Adaptation for Weather-Generalized Depth
  Estimation
Authors: Weilong Yan, Xin Zhang, Robby T. Tan
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

Title: LLaVA-Critic-R1: Your Critic Model is Secretly a Strong Policy Model
Authors: Xiyao Wang, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang, Kai Zhang, Bo Liu, Tianyi
  Xiong, Furong Huang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

Title: CSFMamba: Cross State Fusion Mamba Operator for Multimodal Remote
  Sensing Image Classification
Authors: Qingyu Wang and Xue Jiang and Guozheng Xu

  and Remote Sensing Symposium(IGARSS 2025),not published yet
\\
  Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Title: CascadeFormer: A Family of Two-stage Cascading Transformers for
  Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition
Authors: Yusen Peng, Alper Yilmaz
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

Title: Prompt the Unseen: Evaluating Visual-Language Alignment Beyond
  Supervision
Authors: Raehyuk Jung, Seungjun Yu, Hyunjung Shim
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

Title: Enhancing Fairness in Skin Lesion Classification for Medical Diagnosis
  Using Prune Learning
Authors: Kuniko Paxton, Koorosh Aslansefat, Dhavalkumar Thakker, Yiannis

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CY cs.LG
\\
  Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

Title: Causal Interpretation of Sparse Autoencoder Features in Vision
Authors: Sangyu Han, Yearim Kim, Nojun Kwak
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

  Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

  We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical

  The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the
need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely
on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined

Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense

Title: No More Sibling Rivalry: Debiasing Human-Object Interaction Detection
Authors: Bin Yang, Yulin Zhang, Hong-Yu Zhou, Sibei Yang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accept to ICCV2025
\\
  Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

\\
  Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

  Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an

  This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed

Title: Diffusion-Based Image-to-Brain Signal Generation with Cross-Attention
  Mechanisms for Visual Prostheses
Authors: Ganxi Xu, Jinyi Long, Jia Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

  Autonomous Driving

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

Title: Multimodal Iterative RAG for Knowledge Visual Question Answering
Authors: Changin Choi, Wonseok Lee, Jungmin Ko, Wonjong Rhee
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

\\
  Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

Title: Adaptive Contrast Adjustment Module: A Clinically-Inspired Plug-and-Play
  Approach for Enhanced Fetal Plane Classification
Authors: Yang Chen, Sanglin Zhao, Baoyu Chen and Mans Gustaf
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is

Title: Surface Defect Detection with Gabor Filter Using Reconstruction-Based
  Blurring U-Net-ViT
Authors: Jongwook Si and Sungyoung Kim
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

Title: UPGS: Unified Pose-aware Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene Deblurring
Authors: Zhijing Wu, Longguang Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Title: SegDINO: An Efficient Design for Medical and Natural Image Segmentation
  with DINO-V3
Authors: Sicheng Yang, Hongqiu Wang, Zhaohu Xing, Sixiang Chen, Lei Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

Title: Satellite Image Utilization for Dehazing with Swin Transformer-Hybrid
  U-Net and Watershed loss
Authors: Jongwook Si and Sungyoung Kim
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

  Diffusion

\\
  Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Title: Quantization Meets OOD: Generalizable Quantization-aware Training from a
  Flatness Perspective
Authors: Jiacheng Jiang, Yuan Meng, Chen Tang, Han Yu, Qun Li, Zhi Wang, Wenwu
  Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

Title: Pose as Clinical Prior: Learning Dual Representations for Scoliosis
  Screening
Authors: Zirui Zhou, Zizhao Peng, Dongyang Jin, Chao Fan, Fengwei An, Shiqi Yu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: Accepted to MICCAI 2025
\\
  Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

\\
  CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

Title: DarkVRAI: Capture-Condition Conditioning and Burst-Order Selective Scan
  for Low-light RAW Video Denoising
Authors: Youngjin Oh, Junhyeong Kwon, Junyoung Park, Nam Ik Cho
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

Title: Seeing More, Saying More: Lightweight Language Experts are Dynamic Video
  Token Compressors
Authors: Xiangchen Wang, Jinrui Zhang, Teng Wang, Haigang Zhang and Feng Zheng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 17pages, 8 figures, EMNLP2025
\\
  Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

  We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

  Rainy Conditions
Authors: Ghazal Farhani, Taufiq Rahman, Dominique Charlebois

Comments: Accepted at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular
  Electronics and Safety (ICVES)
\\
  Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by ICCV 2025
\\
  In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

Title: Seeing through Unclear Glass: Occlusion Removal with One Shot
Authors: Qiang Li, Yuanming Cao
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

Title: Bidirectional Sparse Attention for Faster Video Diffusion Training
Authors: Chenlu Zhan, Wen Li, Chuyu Shen, Jun Zhang, Suhui Wu, Hao Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention

Title: An End-to-End Framework for Video Multi-Person Pose Estimation
Authors: Zhihong Wei
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Title: PVINet: Point-Voxel Interlaced Network for Point Cloud Compression
Authors: Xuan Deng, Xingtao Wang, Xiandong Meng, Xiaopeng Fan and Debin Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: FICGen: Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement for Layout-driven
  Degraded Image Generation
Authors: Wenzhuang Wang, Yifan Zhao, Mingcan Ma, Ming Liu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong
  Chen, Jia Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 21 pages, 19 figures, ICCV 2025
\\
  Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

Title: GPSToken: Gaussian Parameterized Spatially-adaptive Tokenization for
  Image Representation and Generation
Authors: Zhengqiang Zhang, Rongyuan Wu, Lingchen Sun, and Lei Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

Title: MetaSSL: A General Heterogeneous Loss for Semi-Supervised Medical Image
  Segmentation
Authors: Weiren Zhao, Lanfeng Zhong, Xin Liao, Wenjun Liao, Sichuan Zhang,

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 13 pages, 12 figures. This work has been accepted by IEEE TMI
\\
  Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Title: MVTrajecter: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking with Trajectory Motion Cost
  and Trajectory Appearance Cost
Authors: Taiga Yamane, Ryo Masumura, Satoshi Suzuki, Shota Orihashi
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by ICCV 2025
\\
  Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Do Video Language Models Really Know Where to Look? Diagnosing Attention
  Failures in Video Language Models
Authors: Hyunjong Ok, Jaeho Lee
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: preprint
\\
  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

Title: DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning
  Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion
Authors: Junxiang Liu and Junming Lin and Jiangtong Li and Jie Li
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.HC eess.SP
Comments: 14 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

  Image Generation via Adaptive Focus
Authors: Qiaoqiao Jin, Siming Fu, Dong She, Weinan Jia, Hualiang Wang, Mu Liu,

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Title: SegAssess: Panoramic quality mapping for robust and transferable
  unsupervised segmentation assessment
Authors: Bingnan Yang, Mi Zhang, Zhili Zhang, Zhan Zhang, Yuanxin Zhao,
  Xiangyun Hu, and Jianya Gong
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

  We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This
dataset is publicly available on \href{URL}{HuggingFace}, and both processing

Authors: Tianwei Ye, Yong Ma, Xiaoguang Mei
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Title: Generalizable Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation with Mixture of
  Low-Rank Experts for Diverse Endoscopic Scenes
Authors: Liangjing Shao, Benshuang Chen, Chenkang Du, Xueli Liu, Xinrong Chen

Comments: 20 pages, 11 figures, Under Review
\\
  Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

Title: Measuring Image-Relation Alignment: Reference-Free Evaluation of VLMs
  and Synthetic Pre-training for Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph Generation
Authors: Ma\"elic Neau, Zoe Falomir, C\'edric Buche and Akihiro Sugimoto
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

  Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive

to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of

  High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

\\
  Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

more so than large language models. While RT-DETRv2 represents an important
advance in real-time detection, most existing diagrams do little to clarify how
its components actually work and fit together. In this article, we explain the
architecture of RT-DETRv2 through a series of eight carefully designed
illustrations, moving from the overall pipeline down to critical components
such as the encoder, decoder, and multi-scale deformable attention. Our goal is
to make the existing one genuinely understandable. By visualizing the flow of
tensors and unpacking the logic behind each module, we hope to provide
researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2
works under the hood.

Title: Learning Correlation-aware Aleatoric Uncertainty for 3D Hand Pose
  Estimation
Authors: Lee Chae-Yeon, Nam Hyeon-Woo, Tae-Hyun Oh
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: BMVC 2025. Project page: https://hand-uncertainty.github.io/
\\
  3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page
is available at https://hand-uncertainty.github.io/.

Title: Towards More Diverse and Challenging Pre-training for Point Cloud
  Learning: Self-Supervised Cross Reconstruction with Decoupled Views
Authors: Xiangdong Zhang, Shaofeng Zhang, Junchi Yan
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by ICCV 2025
\\
  Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is
available at https://github.com/aHapBean/Point-PQAE.

\\
  Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with
real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image
understanding in high-stakes domains. The code is available at

Title: Novel Category Discovery with X-Agent Attention for Open-Vocabulary
  Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Jiahao Li Yang Lu, Yachao Zhang, Fangyong Wang, Yuan Xie, and Yanyun
  Qu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by ACMMM2025
\\
  Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Title: SAR-NAS: Lightweight SAR Object Detection with Neural Architecture
  Search
Authors: Xinyi Yu, Zhiwei Lin, Yongtao Wang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by PRCV 2025
\\
  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

Title: Multi-Representation Adapter with Neural Architecture Search for
  Efficient Range-Doppler Radar Object Detection
Authors: Zhiwei Lin, Weicheng Zheng, Yongtao Wang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by ICANN 2025
\\
  Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable
accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art
performance on RADDet and CARRADA datasets with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1,
respectively.

Title: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation via Ordinary Differential Equations
  over Time Intervals
Authors: Huan Ni, Qingshan Liu, Xiaonan Niu, Danfeng Hong, Lingli Zhao, Haiyan
  Guan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

Title: Guided Model-based LiDAR Super-Resolution for Resource-Efficient
  Automotive scene Segmentation
Authors: Alexandros Gkillas, Nikos Piperigkos, Aris S. Lalos
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

Title: Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion: Calibrated and Efficient Medical Image
  Segmentation
Authors: Fuyou Mao, Beining Wu, Yanfeng Jiang, Han Xue, Yan Tang, and Hao Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Title: Street-Level Geolocalization Using Multimodal Large Language Models and
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Authors: Yunus Serhat Bicakci, Joseph Shingleton, Anahid Basiri
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Title: AgroSense: An Integrated Deep Learning System for Crop Recommendation

Authors: Vishal Pandey, Ranjita Das, Debasmita Biswas
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: Preprint, 23 pages, 6 images, 1 table
\\
  Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

\\
  Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures

  Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

  Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

  Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform

dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust
24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at

Title: Enhancing Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Robust Alignment
  Learning
Authors: Long Zhang, Peipei Song, Jianfeng Dong, Kun Li and Xun Yang
Categories: cs.CV cs.MM
Comments: Accepted at EMNLP 2025
\\
  Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

  We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

Title: Neural Scene Designer: Self-Styled Semantic Image Manipulation
Authors: Jianman Lin, Tianshui Chen, Chunmei Qing, Zhijing Yang, Shuangping

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Title: MILO: A Lightweight Perceptual Quality Metric for Image and Latent-Space
  Optimization

  We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Title: Bangladeshi Street Food Calorie Estimation Using Improved YOLOv8 and
  Regression Model
Authors: Aparup Dhar (1), MD Tamim Hossain (1) and Pritom Barua (1) ((1)

\\
  As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Title: InfoScale: Unleashing Training-free Variable-scaled Image Generation via
  Effective Utilization of Information
Authors: Guohui Zhang, Jiangtong Tan, Linjiang Huang, Zhonghang Yuan, Naishan
  Zheng, Jie Huang, Feng Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Title: Mamba-CNN: A Hybrid Architecture for Efficient and Accurate Facial
  Beauty Prediction
Authors: Djamel Eddine Boukhari
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

  Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

  Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

\\
  We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

Title: PointSlice: Accurate and Efficient Slice-Based Representation for 3D
  Object Detection from Point Clouds
Authors: Liu Qifeng, Zhao Dawei, Dong Yabo, Xiao Liang, Wang Juan, Min Chen, Li

Comments: Manuscript submitted to PATTERN RECOGNITION, currently under review
\\
  3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at
https://github.com/qifeng22/PointSlice2.

Title: A Continuous-Time Consistency Model for 3D Point Cloud Generation
Authors: Sebastian Eilermann, Ren\'e Heesch, Oliver Niggemann
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Title: MSA2-Net: Utilizing Self-Adaptive Convolution Module to Extract
  Multi-Scale Information in Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Chao Deng, Xiaosen Li, Xiao Qin
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Comments: Code: \url{https://github.com/xuyang-liu16/V2Drop}
\\
  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

  General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Title: Acoustic Interference Suppression in Ultrasound images for Real-Time
  HIFU Monitoring Using an Image-Based Latent Diffusion Model
Authors: Dejia Cai, Yao Ran, Kun Yang, Xinwang Shi, Yingying Zhou, Kexian Wu,
  Yang Xu, Yi Hu, Xiaowei Zhou
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

  In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

  We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

Title: O-DisCo-Edit: Object Distortion Control for Unified Realistic Video
  Editing
Authors: Yuqing Chen, Junjie Wang, Lin Liu, Ruihang Chu, Xiaopeng Zhang, Qi
  Tian, Yujiu Yang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

Title: TransForSeg: A Multitask Stereo ViT for Joint Stereo Segmentation and 3D
  Force Estimation in Catheterization
Authors: Pedram Fekri, Mehrdad Zadeh, Javad Dargahi
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO
Comments: Preprint version. This work is intended for future journal submission
\\
  Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

Title: Improving Large Vision and Language Models by Learning from a Panel of
  Peers
Authors: Jefferson Hernandez, Jing Shi, Simon Jenni, Vicente Ordonez, Kushal

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at ICCV 2025
\\
  Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

Title: Q-Sched: Pushing the Boundaries of Few-Step Diffusion Models with
  Quantization-Aware Scheduling
Authors: Natalia Frumkin and Diana Marculescu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

Title: OpenVision 2: A Family of Generative Pretrained Visual Encoders for
  Multimodal Learning
Authors: Yanqing Liu, Xianhang Li, Letian Zhang, Zirui Wang, Zeyu Zheng, Yuyin
  Zhou and Cihang Xie
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Comments: Technical Report
\\
  Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the
instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the
community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive
ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.

Title: GaussianGAN: Real-Time Photorealistic controllable Human Avatars
Authors: Mohamed Ilyes Lakhal, Richard Bowden
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: IEEE conference series on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition 2025
\\
  Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and
33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.

  This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Title: Deep Learning-Based Rock Particulate Classification Using
  Attention-Enhanced ConvNeXt
Authors: Anthony Amankwah and Chris Aldrich
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

Categories: cs.CV physics.med-ph
\\
  Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Title: TransMatch: A Transfer-Learning Framework for Defect Detection in Laser
  Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing
Authors: Mohsen Asghari Ilani, Yaser Mike Banad
Categories: cs.CV physics.comp-ph
\\
  Surface defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) pose significant risks to
the structural integrity of additively manufactured components. This paper
introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and
semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect
data. By effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled novel-class images,
TransMatch circumvents the limitations of previous meta-learning approaches.
Experimental evaluations on a Surface Defects dataset of 8,284 images
demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal
loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect
classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying
diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus
represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect
detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and
reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.

Title: Mixture of Balanced Information Bottlenecks for Long-Tailed Visual
  Recognition
Authors: Yifan Lan, Xin Cai, Jun Cheng, Shan Tan
Categories: cs.CV cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

Comments: Project page: https://yoterel.github.io/PractiLight-project-page/
\\
  Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

\\
  Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Title: Enabling Federated Object Detection for Connected Autonomous Vehicles: A
  Deployment-Oriented Evaluation
Authors: Komala Subramanyam Cherukuri, Kewei Sha, Zhenhua Huang
Categories: cs.CV cs.DC
\\
  Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

Comments: 175 pages, 66 figures
\\
  Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

  Using Computer Vision

  Engineering
\\
  Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

Title: Automated Wildfire Damage Assessment from Multi view Ground level
  Imagery Via Vision Language Models
Authors: Miguel Esparza, Archit Gupta, Ali Mostafavi, Kai Yin, Yiming Xiao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be
available at: https://github.com/wengzp1/GARLSR.

Title: RSCC: A Large-Scale Remote Sensing Change Caption Dataset for Disaster
  Events
Authors: Zhenyuan Chen, Chenxi Wang, Ningyu Zhang, Feng Zhang
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
Comments: under review
\\
  Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets
lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While
single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture
dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the
Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods,
wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging
the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust
training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware
bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate
detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate,
interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

Title: Towards Interpretable Geo-localization: a Concept-Aware Global Image-GPS
  Alignment Framework
Authors: Furong Jia, Lanxin Liu, Ce Hou, Fan Zhang, Xinyan Liu, Yu Liu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Title: Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Diagram Understanding of
  Multimodal Models
Authors: Hiroshi Sasaki
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 10 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Title: 2D Gaussian Splatting with Semantic Alignment for Image Inpainting
Authors: Hongyu Li, Chaofeng Chen, Xiaoming Li, Guangming Lu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

Title: Ensemble-Based Event Camera Place Recognition Under Varying Illumination
Authors: Therese Joseph, Tobias Fischer, Michael Milford
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

Title: MOSAIC: Multi-Subject Personalized Generation via Correspondence-Aware
  Alignment and Disentanglement
Authors: Dong She, Siming Fu, Mushui Liu, Qiaoqiao Jin, Hualiang Wang, Mu Liu,
  Jidong Jiang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

\\
  Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

Title: Draw-In-Mind: Learning Precise Image Editing via Chain-of-Thought
  Imagination
Authors: Ziyun Zeng, Junhao Zhang, Wei Li, Mike Zheng Shou
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: Tech Report
\\
  In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

  In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous
driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial

methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of
more interpretable AI systems.

Title: Palette Aligned Image Diffusion

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 14 pages, 19 figures
\\
  We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

Title: Vision-Based Embedded System for Noncontact Monitoring of Preterm Infant

\\
  Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

  in Referring Multi-Object Tracking Systems

Categories: cs.CV cs.CR
Comments: 12 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables
\\
  Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

  This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on

unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and

Title: ContextFusion and Bootstrap: An Effective Approach to Improve Slot
  Attention-Based Object-Centric Learning
Authors: Pinzhuo Tian, Shengjie Yang, Hang Yu, Alex C. Kot
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

  Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: Accepted to ICCV 2025
\\
  Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Title: SegFormer Fine-Tuning with Dropout: Advancing Hair Artifact Removal in
  Skin Lesion Analysis
Authors: Asif Mohammed Saad, Umme Niraj Mahi
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Title: Enhancing Zero-Shot Pedestrian Attribute Recognition with Synthetic Data
  Generation: A Comparative Study with Image-To-Image Diffusion Models
Authors: Pablo Ayuso-Albizu, Juan C. SanMiguel, Pablo Carballeira
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Paper accepted at AVSS 2025 conference
\\
  Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Title: Omnidirectional Spatial Modeling from Correlated Panoramas
Authors: Xinshen Zhang, Tongxi Fu, Xu Zheng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

Authors: Nils Hoehing, Mayug Maniparambil, Ellen Rushe, Noel E. O'Connor,

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

Title: ADVMEM: Adversarial Memory Initialization for Realistic Test-Time
  Adaptation via Tracklet-Based Benchmarking
Authors: Shyma Alhuwaider, Motasem Alfarra, Juan C. Perez, Merey Ramazanova,
  Bernard Ghanem
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

  This paper explores the automated analysis of palmar features using machine

characteristics from palm images, such as principal line structures, texture,
and shape metrics. These features are used to train predictive models on a
novel dataset curated from annotated palm images. Our approach moves beyond
traditional subjective interpretation by providing a data-driven, quantitative
framework for studying the correlations between palmar morphology and
externally validated traits or conditions. The methodology demonstrates
feasibility for applications in digital anthropometry and personalized user

that machine learning models can identify complex patterns in palm data,

  Neck pain is the primary symptom of cervical spondylosis, yet its underlying
mechanisms remain unclear, leading to uncertain treatment outcomes. To address
the challenges of multimodal feature fusion caused by imaging differences and

Difference Convolution (ABPDC) module that facilitates multimodal integration
by exploiting the advantages of difference convolution in texture extraction
and grayscale invariance, and a Feature Pyramid Registration Auxiliary Network

postoperative neck pain recovery compared with existing methods, and ablation
studies further confirm its effectiveness.

Title: DSGC-Net: A Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network for Crowd Counting
  via Feature Correlation Mining
Authors: Yihong Wu, Jinqiao Wei, Xionghui Zhao, Yidi Li, Shaoyi Du, Bin Ren,
  and Nicu Sebe
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by PRCV 2025
\\
  Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is
available at: https://github.com/Wu-eon/CrowdCounting-DSGCNet.

  Detection in Remote Sensing
Authors: Yingrui Ji, Jiansheng Chen, Jingbo Chen, Anzhi Yue, Chenhao Wang, Kai
  Li, Yao Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

\\
  Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on
real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

Title: Data-Driven Loss Functions for Inference-Time Optimization in
  Text-to-Image Generation
Authors: Sapir Esther Yiflach, Yuval Atzmon, Gal Chechik
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Project page is at https://learn-to-steer-paper.github.io/
\\
  Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

  Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Title: Ordinal Adaptive Correction: A Data-Centric Approach to Ordinal Image
  Classification with Noisy Labels
Authors: Alireza Sedighi Moghaddam, Mohammad Reza Mohammadi
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables
\\
  Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

  Multi-view Diffusion

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to ACM Multimedia 2025
\\
  In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

\\
  Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

Title: MedDINOv3: How to adapt vision foundation models for medical image
  segmentation?
Authors: Yuheng Li, Yizhou Wu, Yuxiang Lai, Mingzhe Hu and Xiaofeng Yang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a
simple yet strong baseline of the proposed decouple aggregation paradigm for

Title: From Noisy Labels to Intrinsic Structure: A Geometric-Structural
  Dual-Guided Framework for Noise-Robust Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Tao Wang, Zhenxuan Zhang, Yuanbo Zhou, Xinlin Zhang, Yuanbin Chen, Tao
  Tan, Guang Yang, Tong Tong
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of
this study are available at https://github.com/ortonwang/GSD-Net.

Title: Faster and Better: Reinforced Collaborative Distillation and
  Self-Learning for Infrared-Visible Image Fusion
Authors: Yuhao Wang, Lingjuan Miao, Zhiqiang Zhou, Yajun Qiao, Lei Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

Title: Towards High-Fidelity, Identity-Preserving Real-Time Makeup Transfer:
  Decoupling Style Generation
Authors: Lydia Kin Ching Chau, Zhi Yu and Ruo Wei Jiang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

  Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Title: GenCompositor: Generative Video Compositing with Diffusion Transformer
Authors: Shuzhou Yang, Xiaoyu Li, Xiaodong Cun, Guangzhi Wang, Lingen Li, Ying
  Shan, Jian Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

Comments: Accepted by ICCV2025
\\
  In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models.Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation.Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over previous
text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective evaluation.

Title: Anisotropic Fourier Features for Positional Encoding in Medical Imaging

Comments: 13 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, to be published in ShapeMI MICCAI 2025
\\
  The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

\\
  Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

Title: Mix-modal Federated Learning for MRI Image Segmentation
Authors: Guyue Hu, Siyuan Song, Jingpeng Sun, Zhe Jin, Chenglong Li, Jin Tang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments:
\\
  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

  Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

Title: FastVGGT: Training-Free Acceleration of Visual Geometry Transformer

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

Title: Diagnosing Psychiatric Patients: Can Large Language and Machine Learning
  Models Perform Effectively in Emergency Cases?
Authors: Abu Shad Ahammed, Sayeri Mukherjee, Roman Obermaisser
Categories: cs.LG cs.CY
\\
  Mental disorders are clinically significant patterns of behavior that are
associated with stress and/or impairment in social, occupational, or family
activities. People suffering from such disorders are often misjudged and poorly
diagnosed due to a lack of visible symptoms compared to other health
complications. During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is
that's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we
have conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language
models (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral
patterns to provide a diagnostic assessment. Data from emergency psychiatric
patients were collected from a rescue station in Germany. Various machine
learning models, including Llama 3.1, were used with rescue patient data to
assess if the predictive capabilities of the models can serve as an efficient
tool for identifying patients with unhealthy mental disorders, especially in
rescue cases.

  Data lakes enable the training of powerful machine learning models on
sensitive, high-value medical datasets, but also introduce serious privacy
risks due to potential leakage of protected health information. Recent studies
show adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent
representations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task
learning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while
enabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy
threats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple
yet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time
through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt
embedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST,
ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task
performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks,
outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.
Ablations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future
directions. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data
lake-trained models and centralized federated learning.

  Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large
language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely
studied due to its efficiency. However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer
from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces
cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction
objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT)
provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs
prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address
these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT
framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the
need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory
overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover,
ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and
equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation
outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ
while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for
high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

Title: Industrial Steel Slag Flow Data Loading Method for Deep Learning
  Applications
Authors: Mert Sehri, Ana Cardoso, Francisco de Assis Boldt, and Patrick Dumond
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Steel casting processes are vulnerable to financial losses due to slag flow
contamination, making accurate slag flow condition detection essential. This
study introduces a novel cross-domain diagnostic method using vibration data
collected from an industrial steel foundry to identify various stages of slag
flow. A hybrid deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional
neural networks and long short-term memory layers is implemented, tested, and
benchmarked against a standard one-dimensional convolutional neural network.
The proposed method processes raw time-domain vibration signals from
accelerometers and evaluates performance across 16 distinct domains using a
realistic cross-domain dataset split. Results show that the hybrid
convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture, when
combined with root mean square preprocessing and a selective embedding data
loading strategy, achieves robust classification accuracy, outperforming
traditional models and loading techniques. The highest test accuracy of 99.10
+/- 0.30 demonstrates the method's capability for generalization and industrial
relevance. This work presents a practical and scalable solution for real-time
slag flow monitoring, contributing to improved reliability and operational
efficiency in steel manufacturing.

  Accurate prediction of chip performance is critical for ensuring energy
efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing. However, developing
minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology
nodes is challenging due to limited training data and the complex relationship
between process variations and $V_{min}$. To address these issues, we propose a
novel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the
16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced
5nm node. A key innovation of our approach is the integration of input features
derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained
characterization of localized process variations -- an essential factor at the

  Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

  The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their
characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on.
Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of
large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations
between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies
the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness.
Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between
weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract
Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the
self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the
matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of
singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the
probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is
found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law
distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance
calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative
method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different
models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution
characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian
process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate
the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.
Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data
generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for
training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model
structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in
the performance of LoRA training.

Title: Teaching AI to Remember: Insights from Brain-Inspired Replay in
  Continual Learning
Authors: Jina Kim
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual
learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously
learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in
the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed
by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of
prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the
most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their
framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using
the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the
effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with
Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay
significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the
cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory
stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood
distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections
reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,
potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore
the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions
for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.

Title: Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Multi-Category Feature
  Engineering for Hydrogen Sorption Prediction in Clays, Shales, and Coals
Authors: Mohammad Nooraiepour, Mohammad Masoudi, Zezhang Song, and Helge
  Hellevang
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Accurate prediction of hydrogen sorption in clays, shales, and coals is vital
for advancing underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and
radioactive waste containment. Traditional experimental methods, while
foundational, are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing
geological heterogeneity. This study introduces an adaptive physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework with multi-category feature engineering to
enhance hydrogen sorption prediction. The framework integrates classical
isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints to ensure physical consistency
while leveraging deep learning flexibility. A comprehensive dataset consisting
of 155 samples, which includes 50 clays, 60 shales, and 45 coals, was employed,
incorporating diverse compositional properties and experimental conditions.
Multi-category feature engineering across seven categories captured complex
sorption dynamics. The PINN employs deep residual networks with multi-head
attention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout for
uncertainty quantification. K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter
optimization achieve significant accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol per kg)
with 67% faster convergence despite 15-fold increased complexity. The framework
demonstrates robust lithology-specific performance across clay minerals (R2 =
0.981), shales (R2 = 0.971), and coals (R2 = 0.978), maintaining 85-91%
reliability scores. Interpretability analysis via SHAP, accumulated local
effects, and Friedman's H-statistics reveal that hydrogen adsorption capacity
dominates predictions, while 86.7% of feature pairs exhibit strong
interactions, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches. This
adaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables
risk-informed decision-making through robust uncertainty quantification.

Title: Applying Deep Learning to Anomaly Detection of Russian Satellite
  Activity for Indications Prior to Military Activity
Authors: David Kurtenbach, Megan Manly, Zach Metzinger
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity
of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and
assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and
warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through
analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and
procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically
significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior
(PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research
looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity.
The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional
autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network
(KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is
used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data
sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up
to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO
activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion
date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on
reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and
unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each
observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability
and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed
for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing
the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not
only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also
details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.

\\
  Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

  Representation
Authors: Chuanxiang Yang, Yuanfeng Zhou, Guangshun Wei, Siyu Ren, Yuan Liu,

Categories: cs.LG cs.GR eess.IV
\\
  Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and
transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this
work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal
representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the
widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single
scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce
the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching
multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling
direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training
strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a
specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental
results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a
variety of signal representation tasks.

Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Conversational AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful tools
across domains, including cybersecurity, where they help detect threats early
and improve response times. However, challenges such as false positives and
complex model management still limit trust. Although Explainable AI (XAI) aims
to make AI decisions more transparent, many security analysts remain uncertain
about its usefulness. This study presents a framework that detects anomalies
and provides high-quality explanations through visual tools BERTViz and Captum,
combined with natural language reports based on attention outputs. This reduces
manual effort and speeds up remediation. Our comparative analysis showed that
RoBERTa offers high accuracy (99.6 %) and strong anomaly detection,
outperforming Falcon-7B and DeBERTa, as well as exhibiting better flexibility
than large-scale Mistral-7B on the HDFS dataset from LogHub. User feedback
confirms the chatbot's ease of use and improved understanding of anomalies,
demonstrating the ability of the developed framework to strengthen
cybersecurity workflows.

Comments: Accepted by DAC'25
\\
  In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great
potential, but the availability of circuit design data is extremely limited,
especially in the public domain. The lack of circuit data has become the
primary bottleneck in developing AI-assisted IC design methods. In this work,
we make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with
valid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates
synthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a
customized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic
Graph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI
community. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit
constraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte
Carlo tree search (MCTS) method further optimizes the logic redundancy in the
generated graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SynCircuit
can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and enhance ML model performance
in downstream circuit design tasks.

  Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), offer powerful capabilities for interpreting the complex data
landscape in healthcare. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of
the capabilities, requirements and applications of GenAI for deriving clinical
insights and improving clinical efficiency. We first provide some background on
the forms and sources of patient data, namely real-time Remote Patient
Monitoring (RPM) streams and traditional Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The
sheer volume and heterogeneity of this combined data present significant
challenges to clinicians and contribute to information overload. In addition,
we explore the potential of LLM-powered applications for improving clinical
efficiency. These applications can enhance navigation of longitudinal patient
data and provide actionable clinical decision support through natural language
dialogue. We discuss the opportunities this presents for streamlining clinician
workflows and personalizing care, alongside critical challenges such as data
integration complexity, ensuring data quality and RPM data reliability,
maintaining patient privacy, validating AI outputs for clinical safety,
mitigating bias, and ensuring clinical acceptance. We believe this work
represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician
data overload due to combined RPM / EHR data complexities.

  There is increased interest in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning (AI/ML) within the nuclear industry and nuclear engineering community.
Effective implementation of AI/ML could offer benefits to the nuclear domain,
including enhanced identification of anomalies, anticipation of system
failures, and operational schedule optimization. However, limited work has been
done to investigate the feasibility and applicability of AI/ML tools in a
functioning nuclear reactor. Here, we go beyond the development of a single
model and introduce a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that integrates both
information technology and operational technology data streams to identify,
characterize, and differentiate (i) among diverse cybersecurity events and (ii)
between cyber events and other operational anomalies. Leveraging Purdue
Universitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a
representative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections
and denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor
conditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and
over 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data
points. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between
normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging
conditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and
information technology data improved classification accuracy but posed
challenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber
events. While results indicate significant promise for AI/ML in nuclear
cybersecurity, the findings also highlight the need for further refinement in
handling complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures.

  Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

  To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

Title: Centralized vs. Federated Learning for Educational Data Mining: A
  Comparative Study on Student Performance Prediction with SAEB Microdata
Authors: Rodrigo Tertulino
Categories: cs.LG cs.CY
Comments: This paper has been prepared to be submitted Brazilian Journal of
  Informatics in Education - RBIE
\\
  The application of data mining and artificial intelligence in education
offers unprecedented potential for personalizing learning and early
identification of at-risk students. However, the practical use of these
techniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's
General Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of
sensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving
computational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the
feasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx
algorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian
Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was
trained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its
performance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two
million student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an
accuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of
61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust
privacy guarantee. The results indicate that Federated Learning is a viable and
effective solution for building collaborative predictive models in the
Brazilian educational context, in alignment with the requirements of the LGPD.

Title: Yet Unnoticed in LSTM: Binary Tree Based Input Reordering, Weight
  Regularization, and Gate Nonlinearization
Authors: Mojtaba Moattari
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has
a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating
mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However,
even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or
long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches
to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found
in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right
weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this
paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either
smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs
and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous
inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As
analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to
bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to
peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of
nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's
knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple
LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results
show they improve accuracy of LSTM.

Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) attempts to enhance the robustness of
models against adversarial attacks by leveraging multiple models. However,
current EAT strategies tend to train the sub-models independently, ignoring the
cooperative benefits between sub-models. Through detailed inspections of the
process of EAT, we find that that samples with classification disparities
between sub-models are close to the decision boundary of ensemble, exerting
greater influence on the robustness of ensemble. To this end, we propose a
novel yet efficient Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT), to
highlight the cooperative learning among sub-models in the ensemble. To be
specific, samples with larger predictive disparities between the sub-models
will receive greater attention during the adversarial training of the other
sub-models. CEAT leverages the probability disparities to adaptively assign
weights to different samples, by incorporating a calibrating distance
regularization. Extensive experiments on widely-adopted datasets show that our
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT
methods. It is noteworthy that CEAT is model-agnostic, which can be seamlessly
adapted into various ensemble methods with flexible applicability.

  The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data
authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for
images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been
largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially
challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time.
We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data in the
wild, where tables have variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a
novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the
only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7
points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an
additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work
provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in
real-world conditions is not only feasible, but can be done with high
reliability.

\\
  Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and
nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced
with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic
optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL
agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling,
General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to
historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic
deviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate
shifting financial contexts. To escape local minima and improve generalization,
the trained policy is refined using genetic algorithms with quantum mutation
via parameterized qubit rotation circuits. Generation-wise rewards and
penalties are logged to visualize convergence and policy behavior. On unseen
fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine
similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating the promise of
combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for
adaptive enterprise budgeting.

  and Pan Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP2025 findings (poster)
\\
  Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs
in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance.
However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

Title: Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation for Neural Network
  Quantization
Authors: Kaiqi Zhao
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

Title: LLM-QUBO: An End-to-End Framework for Automated QUBO Transformation from
  Natural Language Problem Descriptions
Authors: Huixiang Zhang, Mahzabeen Emu and Salimur Choudhury
Categories: cs.LG quant-ph
\\
  Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely
hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem
descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To
address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,
that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system
leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically
generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware
limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition
method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial
complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly
structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated
QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical
solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the
framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a
synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,
addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.
This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a
viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for
large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.

Title: Exploiting a Mixture-of-Layers in an Electrocardiography Foundation
  Model
Authors: Phu X. Nguyen, Huy Phan, Hieu Pham, Christos Chatzichristos, Bert
  Vandenberk, Maarten De Vos
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have
recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications.
However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not
been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the
final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto}
representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks?
Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this
question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the
representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we
introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers
Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise
representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model.
We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision
Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of
relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to
selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers,
thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the
downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the
pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise
averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.

Title: Pre-trained knowledge elevates large language models beyond traditional
  chemical reaction optimizers

  Baldwin, and Gabe Gomes

Comments: 19 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search
through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm.
Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684
experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian
optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or
exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages
growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become
scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective
trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a
topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity
throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain
systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while
achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in
solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails
- suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective
navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured
exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community
validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a
no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM
optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our
findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods
struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than
mathematical optimization.

Title: Principled Approximation Methods for Efficient and Scalable Deep
  Learning
Authors: Pedro Savarese
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: PhD thesis
\\
  Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger
models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown
proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a
wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates
principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning
systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints
and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture
design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose
novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying
discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based
training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These
approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,
leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the
context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture
search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore
implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,
revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an
adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via
scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image
classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the
proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and
inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's
performance.

Title: FNODE: Flow-Matching for data-driven simulation of constrained multibody
  systems
Authors: Hongyu Wang, Jingquan Wang, Dan Negrut
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: 36 pages, 19 figures
\\
  Data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems faces two persistent
challenges: high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy.
To address these issues, we introduce the Flow-Matching Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (FNODE), a framework that learns acceleration vector
fields directly from trajectory data. By reformulating the training objective
to supervise accelerations rather than integrated states, FNODE eliminates the
need for backpropagation through an ODE solver, which represents a bottleneck
in traditional Neural ODEs. Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using
numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of
benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double
pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently
outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE
(MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural
Networks (FCNN), demonstrating good accuracy, generalization, and computational
efficiency.

Title: Democratizing Agentic AI with Fast Test-Time Scaling on the Edge
Authors: Hao Mark Chen, Zhiwen Mo, Guanxi Lu, Shuang Liang, Lingxiao Ma, Wayne
  Luk, Hongxiang Fan
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and
responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities.
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more
compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on
edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that
makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces
three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate
system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model
Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and
verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache
reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on
a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud
models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x
higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline,
paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

Title: From TLinFormer to TConstFormer: The Leap to Constant-Time Transformer
  Attention: Achieving O(1) Computation and O(1) KV Cache during Autoregressive
  Inference
Authors: Zhongpan Tang
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its
autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a
computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process
ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the
TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.
TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a
truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this
mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time
computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single
linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.
Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer
exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,
memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This
breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model
applications.

Title: Estimating Parameter Fields in Multi-Physics PDEs from Scarce
  Measurements
Authors: Xuyang Li, Mahdi Masmoudi, Rami Gharbi, Nizar Lajnef, Vishnu Naresh
  Boddeti
Categories: cs.LG cs.CE
\\
  Parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the mathematical
modeling of complex systems in diverse domains, including engineering,
healthcare, and physics. A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world
applications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the
parameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter
estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,
multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To
address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method
capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system
responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to
continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state
variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct
parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter
estimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors
by two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor
of ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation
capabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data
where PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter
inference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering,
healthcare, and beyond.

Title: Learning to Shard: RL for Co-optimizing the Parallelism Degrees and
  Per-operator Sharding Dimensions in Distributed LLM Inference
Authors: Ruokai Yin, Sattwik Deb Mishra, Xuan Zuo, Hokchhay Tann, Preyas Shah,
  Apala Guha
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC
\\
  Distributed LLM inference requires careful coordination of parallelization
strategies across hundreds to thousands of NPUs to meet production SLOs.
Current systems like Megatron-LM rely on static heuristics that separately
configure parallelism degrees and per-operator sharding dimensions, leaving
significant performance on the table as models scale and hardware topologies
diversify. We introduce Learn to Shard, to our knowledge, the first RL-based
approach to co-optimize both coarse-grained parallelism degrees and
fine-grained per-operator sharding dimensions for distributed LLM inference.
Our method employs an attention-based policy over an elite history that learns
from high-performing strategies to efficiently navigate the vast combinatorial
search space. Evaluated on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters,
Learn to Shard achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over metaheuristic
baselines and 1.06x over Megatron heuristics.

Title: Speech Foundation Models Generalize to Time Series Tasks from Wearable
  Sensor Data
Authors: Jaya Narain, Zakaria Aldeneh, Shirley Ren
Categories: cs.LG eess.AS
Comments: Preprint, under review
\\
  Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time-
and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show
that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable
sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0
outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on
modality specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and
activity classification tasks. We find a particularly strong relevance of the
convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks.
The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce
time series tasks, using simple probing methods. This work is a step towards
generalized time series models for speech and sensor data, a topic for further
exploration.

Title: Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model for Efficient Time Series
  Prediction
Authors: Stefan-Alexandru Jura, Mihai Udrescu, Alexandru Topirceanu
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Long-range time series forecasting remains challenging, as it requires
capturing non-stationary and multi-scale temporal dependencies while
maintaining noise robustness, efficiency, and stability. Transformer-based
architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer
from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons.
State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face
unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited
robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose
the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid
quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a
variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,
Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose
expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating
mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term
dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We
empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic,
and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong
baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These
findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current
limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust
multivariate predictions.

  Decomposition

Categories: cs.LG cs.DC cs.PF
\\
  Tensor decomposition (TD) is essential for analyzing high-dimensional sparse
data, yet its irregular computations and memory-access patterns pose major
performance challenges on modern parallel processors. Prior works rely on
expert-designed sparse tensor formats that fail to adapt to irregular tensor
shapes and/or highly variable data distributions. We present the
reinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding (ReLATE) framework, a novel
learning-augmented method that automatically constructs efficient sparse tensor
representations without labeled training samples. ReLATE employs an autonomous
agent that discovers optimized tensor encodings through direct interaction with
the TD environment, leveraging a hybrid model-free and model-based algorithm to
learn from both real and imagined actions. Moreover, ReLATE introduces
rule-driven action masking and dynamics-informed action filtering mechanisms
that ensure functionally correct tensor encoding with bounded execution time,
even during early learning stages. By automatically adapting to both irregular
tensor shapes and data distributions, ReLATE generates sparse tensor
representations that consistently outperform expert-designed formats across
diverse sparse tensor data sets, achieving up to 2X speedup compared to the
best sparse format, with a geometric-mean speedup of 1.4-1.46X.

Title: Continuously Tempered Diffusion Samplers
Authors: Ezra Erives, Bowen Jing, Peter Holderrieth, Tommi Jaakkola
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized
distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities
interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training
phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are
generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a
proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed
Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of
the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration
and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose
continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques
developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal
distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different
temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and
drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate
improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available

  TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular
benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest
choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens
because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.
  Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as
selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a
\textbf{tiled-block} strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework.
This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to \textbf{process long contexts
without any pre-processing}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach

\\
  Learning and evaluating recommender systems from logged implicit feedback is
challenging due to exposure bias. While inverse propensity scoring (IPS)
corrects this bias, it often suffers from high variance and instability. In
this paper, we present a simple and effective pipeline that integrates
IPS-weighted training with an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
objective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer (PR). We compare Direct Method
(DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation, and
demonstrate how IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased
exposure. The proposed PR further mitigates variance amplification from extreme
propensity weights, leading to more stable estimates. Experiments on synthetic
and MovieLens 100K data show that our approach generalizes better under
unbiased exposure while reducing evaluation variance compared to naive and
standard IPS methods, offering practical guidance for counterfactual learning
and evaluation in real-world recommendation settings.

Title: Are We Really Learning the Score Function? Reinterpreting Diffusion
  Models Through Wasserstein Gradient Flow Matching
Authors: An B. Vuong, Michael T. McCann, Javier E. Santos, Yen Ting Lin
Categories: cs.LG
Report-no: LA-UR-25-28802 (Version 2)
\\
  Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function,
i.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption
implies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is
not enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present
numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and
differential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that
the learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models
perform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent
paradox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is
better understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein
Gradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. Under this view, the "probability flow"
arises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke
reverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains
successful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further
show that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily
harm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective
as a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for
understanding diffusion generative models.

Title: LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion: Enhancing Generalization in Offline
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Hanping Zhang, Yuhong Guo
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making
capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios.
However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of
well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of
generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations
of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often
struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,
we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances
generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method
incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide
policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based
prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge
base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode
trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral
patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as
conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling
the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental
results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods
on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and
adaptability in diverse settings.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 24 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural
networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability.
One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning
(PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model
prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating
such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction
in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence
rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational
precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and
cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical
perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz
continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the
loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a
set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory
prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results
confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently
achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate
the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where
corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves
predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.

Title: Optimized Weight Initialization on the Stiefel Manifold for Deep ReLU
  Neural Networks
Authors: Hyungu Lee, Taehyeong Kim, Hayoung Choi
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables
\\
  Stable and efficient training of ReLU networks with large depth is highly
sensitive to weight initialization. Improper initialization can cause permanent
neuron inactivation dying ReLU and exacerbate gradient instability as network
depth increases. Methods such as He, Xavier, and orthogonal initialization
preserve variance or promote approximate isometry. However, they do not
necessarily regulate the pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity,
and their effectiveness often diminishes in very deep architectures. This work
introduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by
solving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving

of closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.
Theoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU

architectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular

Title: Unifying Adversarial Perturbation for Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Jinluan Yang, Ruihao Zhang, Zhengyu Chen, Fei Wu, Kun Kuang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have
implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the
robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying
perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently
minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the
adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in
enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has
been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial
perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and
improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation
operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified
framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a
unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and
adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using
different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly
improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs,
outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and
adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's
performance.

Title: Curriculum Guided Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning
Authors: Minku Kang, Hogun Park
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Accepted to the CIKM 2025. This is an extended version of the
  original submission

\\
  Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data
heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation
personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from
clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model
states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid
overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even
collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce
their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.
To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called
Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the
client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges
for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first
to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,
client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased
patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,
the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic
knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves
weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained
structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior
performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at
https://github.com/Kang-Min-Ku/CUFL.git.

  This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental
barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a
few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with
the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately
preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training
instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training
framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to
efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad
distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning
rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better
capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range
regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range
distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8
training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy
comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under
advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available
at: https://github.com/typename-yyf/Metis-quantization.

Title: Lagrangian Relaxation for Multi-Action Partially Observable Restless
  Bandits: Heuristic Policies and Indexability
Authors: Rahul Meshram and Kesav Kaza
Categories: cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 13 pages
\\
  Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous
applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public
healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action
partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of
the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite
states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite
actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for
each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health
intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term
discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves
according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The
state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals
are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that
bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are
assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent
through the budget constraint.
  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable
restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,
finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian
bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of
Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout
policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and
provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study
heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present
Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.

Title: Memory Limitations of Prompt Tuning in Transformers
Authors: Maxime Meyer, Mario Michelessa, Caroline Chaux, Vincent Y. F. Tan
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Despite the empirical success of prompt tuning in adapting pretrained
language models to new tasks, theoretical analyses of its capabilities remain
limited. Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation
properties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this
paper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the
memorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical
contributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a
transformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length. Second,
and more importantly, we present the first formal proof of a phenomenon
empirically observed in large language models: performance degradation in
transformers with extended contexts. We rigorously demonstrate that
transformers inherently have limited memory, constraining the amount of
information they can retain, regardless of the context size. This finding
offers a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic limitations of transformer
architectures, particularly their ability to handle long sequences.

  Input-dependent activation sparsity is a notable property of deep learning
models, which has been extensively studied in networks with ReLU activations
and is associated with efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. However,
the approaches developed for ReLU-based models depend on exact zero activations
and do not transfer directly to modern large language models~(LLMs), which have
abandoned ReLU in favor of other activation functions. As a result, current
work on activation sparsity in LLMs is fragmented, model-specific, and lacks
consensus on which components to target. We propose a general framework to
assess sparsity robustness and present a systematic study of the phenomenon in
the FFN layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs. Our findings reveal
universal patterns of activation sparsity in LLMs, provide insights into this
phenomenon, and offer practical guidelines for exploiting it in model design
and acceleration.

Title: Localizing and Mitigating Memorization in Image Autoregressive Models
Authors: Aditya Kasliwal, Franziska Boenisch, Adam Dziedzic
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: Accepted at ICML 2025 Workshop on the Impact of Memorization on
  Trustworthy Foundation Models
\\
  Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in speed and quality of generated images. However, they also raise concerns
about memorization of their training data and its implications for privacy.
This work explores where and how such memorization occurs within different
image autoregressive architectures by measuring a fine-grained memorization.
The analysis reveals that memorization patterns differ across various
architectures of IARs. In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends
to emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard
autoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing
stages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to
IARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most
memorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction
from IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images. These
findings offer new insights into the internal behavior of image generative
models and point toward practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks.

Title: Graph Convolutional Network With Pattern-Spatial Interactive and
  Regional Awareness for Traffic Forecasting
Authors: Xinyu Ji, Chengcheng Yan, Jibiao Yuan, Fiefie Zhao
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Traffic forecasting is significant for urban traffic management, intelligent
route planning, and real-time flow monitoring. Recent advances in
spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate
spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most
previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling
spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which
have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial
correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies
fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and
Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic
forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion
framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to
capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective
from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with
positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional
network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a
regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with
regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional
heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on
three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the
State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.

Title: Biological Pathway Informed Models with Graph Attention Networks (GATs)
Authors: Gavin Wong, Ping Shu Ho, Ivan Au Yeung, Ka Chun Cheung, Simon See
Categories: cs.LG q-bio.MN
Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human
processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured
tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models
capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of
genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene
level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81%
reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment
conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by
encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness.
Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five
gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw
time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological
hypotheses directly from experimental data.

Title: FedThief: Harming Others to Benefit Oneself in Self-Centered Federated
  Learning
Authors: Xiangyu Zhang and Mang Ye
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR
Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures
\\
  In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be
directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing
attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the
global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private
models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by
self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by
developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to
cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated
Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the
performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own
models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named
FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading
modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the
private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where
"divergence" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that
integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that
our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the
attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global
model.

Title: Advanced spectral clustering for heterogeneous data in credit risk

Comments: 25 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables
\\
  Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and
textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

Title: Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree for the Analysis of
  Heterogeneous Credit Data in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
Authors: Lu Han, Xiuying Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
Comments: 26 pages,11 figures, 5 tables
\\
  Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

Title: An Efficient GNNs-to-KANs Distillation via Self-Attention Dynamic
  Sampling with Potential for Consumer Electronics Edge Deployment
Authors: Can Cui, Zilong Fu, Penghe Huang, Yuanyuan Li, Wu Deng, Dongyan Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.PF
\\
  Knowledge distillation (KD) is crucial for deploying deep learning models in
resource-constrained edge environments, particularly within the consumer
electronics sector, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and
mobile terminals. These applications place higher demands on model compression
and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,
due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs
face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies
learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self
Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier
KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.
Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift
mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves
its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational
complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based
on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive
weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the
student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive
experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD
achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models
and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark
models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%
decrease in inference time.

Title: TranCIT: Transient Causal Interaction Toolbox

Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Quantifying transient causal interactions from non-stationary neural signals
is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Traditional methods are often
inadequate for brief neural events, and advanced, event-specific techniques
have lacked accessible implementations within the Python ecosystem. Here, we
introduce trancit (Transient Causal Interaction Toolbox), an open-source Python
package designed to bridge this gap. TranCIT implements a comprehensive
analysis pipeline, including Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and the more
robust Structural Causal Model-based Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) and relative
Dynamic Causal Strength (rDCS) for accurately detecting event-driven causal
effects. We demonstrate TranCIT's utility by successfully capturing causality
in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail and by identifying the
known transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave
ripple events in real-world data. The package offers a user-friendly, validated
solution for investigating the transient causal dynamics that govern complex
systems.

Title: RoFt-Mol: Benchmarking Robust Fine-Tuning with Molecular Graph
  Foundation Models

Categories: cs.LG physics.chem-ph
\\
  In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific
downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust
fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse
labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties
that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training
datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which
require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse
objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better
understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we
classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,
representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on
downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and
self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive
evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined
robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of
simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble
fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types
while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.

  The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet
accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear
couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron
Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations,
but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global
measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during
strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning
framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion
Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates
heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices,
and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment
strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves
robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as
3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest
predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers
interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational
applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and
community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the
open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

Title: Disentangling Slow and Fast Temporal Dynamics in Degradation Inference
  with Hierarchical Differential Models
Authors: Mengjie Zhao and Olga Fink
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Reliable inference of system degradation from sensor data is fundamental to
condition monitoring and prognostics in engineered systems. Since degradation
is rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate
health assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because
operational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces
only subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect
short-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the
underlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but
the residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in
noisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with
dynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising
framework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in
slow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,
while degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation
(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)
CDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a
multi-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a
learnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to
control degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces
monotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.
Through comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and
steady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively
disentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms
residual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable
inference.

of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

Title: Context-Action Embedding Learning for Off-Policy Evaluation in
  Contextual Bandits
Authors: Kushagra Chandak, Vincent Liu, Haanvid Lee
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite
action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method
for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the
action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are
underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate
this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not
minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider
context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action
Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action
embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator.
Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present
an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a
synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator
outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.

Title: Missing Data Imputation using Neural Cellular Automata
Authors: Tin Luu, Binh Nguyen, Man Ngo
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: 20 pages, 4 figures
\\
  When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most painful
problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better
and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development
evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of
leveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing
version of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative
Adversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural
Cellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we
propose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with
some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing
data imputation problem. We also provide several experiments to evidence that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation error and
post-imputation performance.

Title: IndiaWeatherBench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Data-Driven Regional
  Weather Forecasting over India
Authors: Tung Nguyen, Harkanwar Singh, Nilay Naharas, Lucas Bandarkar, Aditya

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI physics.ao-ph
\\
  Regional weather forecasting is a critical problem for localized climate
adaptation, disaster mitigation, and sustainable development. While machine
learning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional
forecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use
different datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and
reproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
data-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent.
IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution
regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and
probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To
establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across
diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks,
as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives.
While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other
geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model
implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future
development. We hope IndiaWeatherBench will serve as a foundation for advancing
regional weather forecasting research. Code is available at

Title: An Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for Replica-Exchange-based
  Physics-informed Operator Learning Network
Authors: Binghang Lu, Changhong Mou, Guang Lin
Categories: cs.LG cs.NE
\\
  In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for
Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a
novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial
differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning
network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While
physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep
Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to
traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and
physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and
providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these
limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to
adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii)
replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global
parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in
Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed
operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems
including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed
diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently
outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise
robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.

Title: Valid Property-Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Targeted Optimization &
  Resampling for Novel Drug Design
Authors: Amartya Banerjee, Somnath Kar, Anirban Pal, Debabrata Maiti

Comments: Code: https://github.com/amartya21/vector-drug-design.git
\\
  Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant
regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery
under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive
Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples
property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation.
VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables
interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We
evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with
experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056
molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates
novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of
8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with
the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor
($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl
pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns)
confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes
to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than
established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE
and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity
highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our
work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design
in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for
reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.

  Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2025

\\
  In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or
sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and
requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and
transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing
downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this
learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data
Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target
attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction
accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating
high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large
search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from
utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative
learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to
discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any
regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq
encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and
adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals
during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves
predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%,
demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.

Title: Robust Spatiotemporal Forecasting Using Adaptive Deep-Unfolded
  Variational Mode Decomposition
Authors: Osama Ahmad, Lukas Wesemann, Fabian Waschkowski, Zubair Khalid
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: Under review in IEEE Signal Processing Letter
\\
  Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting is critical for numerous complex systems
but remains challenging due to complex volatility patterns and spectral
entanglement in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs). While
decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional
network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from
computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these
limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms
iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module.
Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces
iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition
time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable
bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate
manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST
benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction
in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Title: Why Pool When You Can Flow? Active Learning with GFlowNets
Authors: Renfei Zhang, Mohit Pandey, Artem Cherkasov, Martin Ester
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI q-bio.QM
Comments: 6 pages; 5 figures
\\
  The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational
cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly
acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies
such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative
samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries
containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a
generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method
leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in
proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition
with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is
independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening
experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to
that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse
molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular
discovery.

Title: Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation: A Replay-Free and Resource-Efficient
  Approach For Continual Graph Learning
Authors: Jingtao Liu, Xinming Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while
retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph
applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The
Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance
between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The
Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on
extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource
burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies
not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically
modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that
lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning
process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive
Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new
path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural
Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to
store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these
modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a
similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it
selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a
frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its
internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.
Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Title: Attribute Fusion-based Classifier on Framework of Belief Structure
Authors: Qiying Hu and Yingying Liang and Qianli Zhou and Witold Pedrycz
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification
tasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer
from oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of
the belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing
their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an
enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations
through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that
utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership
function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a
tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform
the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from
normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible
representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief
structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into
decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted
to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier
and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with
both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The
results demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing
evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,
while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and
robustness.

Title: Flow Matters: Directional and Expressive GNNs for Heterophilic Graphs
Authors: Arman Gupta, Govind Waghmare, Gaurav Oberoi, Nitish Srivastava
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different
classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their
reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that
modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily
and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on
polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order
interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge
directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in
heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a
polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant
(Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models
are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over
input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.
Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model
consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers
additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),
achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,
introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the
benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings
highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature
modeling in heterophilic graph learning.

Title: ProCause: Generating Counterfactual Outcomes to Evaluate Prescriptive
  Process Monitoring Methods
Authors: Jakob De Moor, Hans Weytjens, Johannes De Smedt
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ME
\\
  Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining
that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on
event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of
ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative
deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has
been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions
to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal
dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture,
TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce
ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and
non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner,
T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known
ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an
ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs
shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are
present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a
real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM
methods.

  At the intersection of the cutting-edge technologies and privacy concerns,
Federated Learning (FL) with its distributed architecture, stands at the
forefront in a bid to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, the applicability of FL systems
is hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity
that can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed
predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey
thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data,
client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and
limitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques
utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training
process. We delineate a comprehensive overview of the several notions,
theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and
their adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments. Furthermore, we
examine salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness
quantitatively. Finally, we envisage exciting open research directions that
have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL
frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this
pivotal area.

  Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

\\
  Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models
are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability,
it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often
misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We
propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships
into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By
combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the
Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal
strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP.
Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are
merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of
Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model
explanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as
healthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for
informed decision-making.

Title: Predicting Multi-Type Talented Students in Secondary School Using
  Semi-Supervised Machine Learning
Authors: Xinzhe Zheng, Zhen-Qun Yang, Jiannong Cao, Jiabei Cheng
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Talent identification plays a critical role in promoting student development.
However, traditional approaches often rely on manual processes or focus
narrowly on academic achievement, and typically delaying intervention until the
higher education stage. This oversight overlooks diverse non-academic talents
and misses opportunities for early intervention. To address this gap, this
study introduces TalentPredictor, a novel semi-supervised multi-modal neural
network that combines Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. This model is
designed to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,
leadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students
within an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational
data from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the
limitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various
award records into talent categories and extracting features from students'
diverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908
classification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC). This demonstrates the potential of
machine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development.

Title: An Explainable Gaussian Process Auto-encoder for Tabular Data
Authors: Wei Zhang, Brian Barr, John Paisley
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community
where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an
important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have
leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper,
we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the
auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting
model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to
overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for
searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm

The results show that our method is capable of generating diversified and

  Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially
reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and
scalable alternative to Transformers.

Title: Superposition in Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Lukas Pertl, Han Xuanyuan, Pietro Li\`o
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message
passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts.
We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features,
directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with
unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional
centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node
level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics.
Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in
overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling
partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis
alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into
metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry
with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and
suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

Title: SCOUT: Toward Sub-Quadratic Attention via Segment Compression for
  Optimized Utility in Transformers
Authors: Aref Jafari, Yuhe Fan, Benyamin Jamialahmadi, Parsa Farinneya, Boxing
  Chen, Marzieh S. Tahaei
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of
sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits
scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window
attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized
operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,
these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their
inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT
(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid
architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and
applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token
embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that
integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,
each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens
that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity
of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory
cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT
incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate
remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We
analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically
on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba
and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same
computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling
and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT
achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering
comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.

Title: ART: Adaptive Resampling-based Training for Imbalanced Classification
Authors: Arjun Basandrai, Shourya Jain and K. Ilanthenral
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Submitted to SIGKDD'26
\\
  Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses
fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority.
These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which
can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that
periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the
class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1
scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to
be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and
outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to
incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that
better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast
dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and
algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well
as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On
tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests
(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to
training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average
of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing
methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the
strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.

  in Cyber-Physical Systems

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model
personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning.
However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated
learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated
learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,
such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data
distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in
real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine
clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only
when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of
clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients
within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is
possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'
behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to
achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated
multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency
when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.
Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the
received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a
trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.
Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a
Byzantine-free setting.

  Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture
by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and
non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT
outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on
SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while
significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT
is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and
validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is

\\
  Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate
sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong
performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do
not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations.
To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a
discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible
length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference.
Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs
generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we
show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics
with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve
$\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show
pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes
only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior
performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance
($52\% \to 65\%$).

Title: Reinforcement Learning Driven Generalizable Feature Representation for
  Cross-User Activity Recognition
Authors: Xiaozhou Ye, Kevin I-Kai Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.HC
\\
  Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for
healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user
variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and
physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings.
Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific
patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain
generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal
dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose
Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a
novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential
decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a
Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that
capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective
reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key
innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2)
autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a
label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations.
Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior
accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant
temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating
advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and
context-aware environments.

\\
  Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they
directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly
accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting
synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However,
existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined
fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures
are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the
structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations,
we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which
supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a
dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific
literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural
complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and
conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation
enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for
future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.

\\
  Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain
activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and
environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world
deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence
of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact
removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace
Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without
incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement
units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This
work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation
attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU
data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model
contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU
recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base
model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across
varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU
reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion
scenarios.

Comments: RefineStat constrains LM decoding with statistical validity checks

\\
  Probabilistic programming offers a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty, yet statistical model discovery in this domain entails navigating
an immense search space under strict domain-specific constraints. When small
language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they
frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors,
such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers'
domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language
model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized
programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then
applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood
components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple
probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models
(SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and
statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source
large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).

  Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model
evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations:
insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency,
sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper
introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric
that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency.
By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores,
we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for
model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and
experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz
robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing
the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first
standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective
comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are
fully open-source.

\\
  Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication
systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current
approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to
redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their
task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for
image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract
an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the
source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed
representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features
for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,
we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent
representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to
various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations
are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several
datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,
and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under
different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

Title: MATL-DC: A Multi-domain Aggregation Transfer Learning Framework for EEG
  Emotion Recognition with Domain-Class Prototype under Unseen Targets
Authors: Guangli Li, Canbiao Wu, Zhehao Zhou, Na Tian, Zhen Liang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is
increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer
Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly
depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical
application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain
Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with
Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature
decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from
domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training
stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature
space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional
EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype
representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning
strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity
problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of
label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen
during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained
domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We
rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and
SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%,
68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better
performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The

Title: Nonlinear Performative Prediction
Authors: Guangzheng Zhong, Yang Liu, Jiming Liu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Performative prediction is an emerging paradigm in machine learning that
addresses scenarios where the model's prediction may induce a shift in the
distribution of the data it aims to predict. Current works in this field often
rely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative
loss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to
maintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.
However, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data
usually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax
these out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes
performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential
theoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of
performative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to
nonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution
shift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two
distributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the
performative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for
both linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a
critical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these
theoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative
stability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and
nonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be highly effective in various
graph learning tasks. A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed
number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each
node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical
real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of
message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This
finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To
address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel
framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for
each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any
model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node

Title: StoxLSTM: A Stochastic Extended Long Short-Term Memory Network for Time
  Series Forecasting
Authors: Zihao Wang, Yunjie Li, Lingmin Zan, Zheng Gong, Mengtao Zhu
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has attracted widespread
research interest due to its enhanced capability to model complex temporal
dependencies in diverse time series applications. Despite its success, there is
still potential to further improve its representational capacity and
forecasting performance, particularly on challenging real-world datasets with
unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a
stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into
a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables
within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially
designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying
temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available
benchmark datasets from multiple research communities demonstrate that StoxLSTM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and
stronger generalization ability.

Title: Preserving Vector Space Properties in Dimensionality Reduction: A
  Relationship Preserving Loss Framework
Authors: Eddi Weinwurm, Alexander Kovalenko
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as
orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including
cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a
Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these
properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g.,
Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings.
RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error
bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest
that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on
downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space
properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction,
this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain
alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and
invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning,
where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.

Title: Geometric origin of adversarial vulnerability in deep learning
Authors: Yixiong Ren, Wenkang Du, Jianhui Zhou, Haiping Huang
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

Title: What Expressivity Theory Misses: Message Passing Complexity for GNNs
Authors: Niklas Kemper, Tom Wollschl\"ager, Stephan G\"unnemann
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has
become the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving
for higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,
higher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks
rarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity
theory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect
GNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message
Passing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty
for a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC
captures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the
theoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively
narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on
fundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate
with empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and
failures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more
powerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN
architectures.

Title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Task Offloading in Wireless Edge
  Networks
Authors: Andrea Fox, Francesco De Pellegrini, Eitan Altman
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NI
Comments: Submitted at AI4NextG @ NeurIPS'25 Workshop
\\
  In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and
independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

Comments: Preprint. Under review
\\
  LLMs face significant challenges in systematic generalization, particularly
when dealing with reasoning tasks requiring compositional rules and handling
out-of-distribution examples. To address these challenges, we introduce an
in-context learning methodology that improves the generalization capabilities
of general purpose LLMs. Our approach employs an iterative example selection
strategy, which incrementally constructs a tailored set of few-shot examples
optimized to enhance model's performance on a given task. As a proof of
concept, we apply this methodology to the resolution of algebraic expressions
involving non-standard simplification rules, according to which the priority of
addition and multiplication is changed.
  Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit limited proficiency in these
mathematical tasks. We further demonstrate that LLMs reasoning benefits from
our iterative shot selection prompting strategy integrated with explicit
reasoning instructions. Crucially, our experiments reveal that some LLMs
achieve better generalization performances when prompted with simpler few-shot
examples rather than complex ones following the test data distribution.

  Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a
common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number
of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide
state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to
efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies
trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these
surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or
Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled
datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples
acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the
regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the
best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space
representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the
state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of
surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on
complex simulators.

\\
  Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation,
plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft
matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally
expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and
geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning
solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often
fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries.
Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the
evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics,
achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global
spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and
regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO
outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator
baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By
encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires
less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes
E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.

Title: Towards Trustworthy Vital Sign Forecasting: Leveraging Uncertainty for
  Prediction Intervals
Authors: Li Rong Wang, Thomas C. Henderson, Yew Soon Ong, Yih Yng Ng, Xiuyi Fan

Comments: Accepted at the 25th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining
  (ICDM)
\\
  Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators
of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and
decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting
these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because
clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable
uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals
(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a
meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical
decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from
the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure
well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and
support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that
prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula
distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,
based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional
error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these
methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,
representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate
that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction
baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on
high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of
RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign
forecasts.

Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as
estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs
distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels.
Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering
effort, which limits the scalability of intelligent battery management. Here we
present the Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE), a flexible pretraining
framework that can learn with missing battery data channels and capture
inter-correlations across data snippets. FMAE learns unified battery
representations from heterogeneous data and can be adopted by different tasks
with minimal data and engineering efforts. Experimentally, FMAE consistently
outperforms all task-specific methods across five battery management tasks with
eleven battery datasets. On remaining life prediction tasks, FMAE uses 50 times
less inference data while maintaining state-of-the-art results. Moreover, when
real-world data lack certain information, such as system voltage, FMAE can
still be applied with marginal performance impact, achieving comparable results
with the best hand-crafted features. FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a
flexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management
of dynamical systems.

Title: Globally aware optimization with resurgence
Authors: Wei Bu
Categories: cs.LG math-ph math.MP math.OC
Comments: 11+9 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based
methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$
landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to
initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages
resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural
information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the
factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition
functions encode precise information about all critical objective function
value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition
function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$,
extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane
singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function
values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers,
enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal
regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded
in the geometry of the optimization landscape.

Title: AT Loss: Advanced Torrential Loss Function for Precipitation Forecasting
Authors: Jaeho Choi, Hyeri Kim, Kwang-Ho Kim, Jaesung Lee
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI physics.ao-ph
\\
  Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the
context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have
recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods
such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many
recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more
advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical
success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective
during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,
rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this
limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the
resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential
(AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss
demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast
performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the
operational model.

  In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal
impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis
using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying
interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the
predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and
second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect
the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able
to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely
locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced
by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the
large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia
Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact
and improve predictive performance.

Comments: Accepted by EMNLP 2025
\\
  Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models
predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration
into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a
holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and
deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data
processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data
processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning
strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of
instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism
for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress
noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model
deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training
data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which
involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database
construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy
leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM
significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM
to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.
Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

  Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that
helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the
structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to
recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation
problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based
Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the
sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation
efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional
posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In
addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix
to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.
Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to
solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates
significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the
ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential
to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

  Message-passing architectures struggle to sufficiently model long-range
dependencies in node and graph prediction tasks. We propose a novel approach
exploiting hierarchical graph structures and adaptive random walks to address
this challenge. Our method introduces learnable transition probabilities that
decide whether the walk should prefer the original graph or travel across
hierarchical shortcuts. On a synthetic long-range task, we demonstrate that our
approach can exceed the theoretical bound that constrains traditional
approaches operating solely on the original topology. Specifically, walks that
prefer the hierarchy achieve the same performance as longer walks on the
original graph. These preliminary findings open a promising direction for
efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range

Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Deep generative models with discrete latent space, such as the
Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), offer excellent data
generation capabilities, but, due to the large size of their latent space,
their probabilistic inference is deemed intractable. We demonstrate that the
VQ-VAE can be distilled into a tractable model by selecting a subset of latent
variables with high probabilities. This simple strategy is particularly
efficient, especially if the VQ-VAE underutilizes its latent space, which is,
indeed, very often the case. We frame the distilled model as a probabilistic
circuit, and show that it preserves expressiveness of the VQ-VAE while
providing tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments illustrate competitive
performance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks, challenging
the view of the VQ-VAE as an inherently intractable model.

\\
  Instance-dependent cost-sensitive (IDCS) classifiers offer a promising
approach to improving cost-efficiency in credit scoring by tailoring loss
functions to instance-specific costs. However, the impact of such loss
functions on the stability of model explanations remains unexplored in
literature, despite increasing regulatory demands for transparency. This study
addresses this gap by evaluating the stability of Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
when applied to IDCS models. Using four publicly available credit scoring
datasets, we first assess the discriminatory power and cost-efficiency of IDCS
classifiers, introducing a novel metric to enhance cross-dataset comparability.
We then investigate the stability of SHAP and LIME feature importance rankings
under varying degrees of class imbalance through controlled resampling. Our
results reveal that while IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency, they
produce significantly less stable explanations compared to traditional models,
particularly as class imbalance increases, highlighting a critical trade-off
between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring. Amid
increasing regulatory scrutiny on explainability, this research underscores the
pressing need to address stability issues in IDCS classifiers to ensure that
their cost advantages are not undermined by unstable or untrustworthy
explanations.

Title: Accelerating PDE Solvers with Equation-Recast Neural Operator
  Preconditioning
Authors: Qiyun Cheng, Md Hossain Sahadath, Huihua Yang, Shaowu Pan and Wei Ji
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  The computational overhead of traditional numerical solvers for partial
differential equations (PDEs) remains a critical bottleneck for large-scale
parametric studies and design optimization. We introduce a Minimal-Data
Parametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which
establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while
strictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the
residual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained
neural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This
directly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural
operators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained
at a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any
retraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative
PDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence
iterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,
MD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,
eliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework
is architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation
solvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural
operators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully
accelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous
parameter distributions. Besides, MD-PNOP consistently achieves ~50% reduction
in computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for fixed-source,
single-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems.

unified geometric framework, that views these goals as instances of a single
optimization problem on the space of achievable long-term behavior in an
environment. Within this framework, classical methods such as policy mirror

objectives, and outline open challenges at the interface of geometry and deep
RL.

Title: Benchmarking Optimizers for Large Language Model Pretraining
Authors: Andrei Semenov, Matteo Pagliardini, Martin Jaggi
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: 73 pages, 44 figures, 48 tables
\\
  The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by an effervescence of novel ideas and methods to better optimize the loss of
deep learning models. Claims from those methods are myriad: from faster
convergence to removing reliance on certain hyperparameters. However, the
diverse experimental protocols used to validate these claims make direct
comparisons between methods challenging. This study presents a comprehensive
evaluation of recent optimization techniques across standardized LLM
pretraining scenarios, systematically varying model size, batch size, and
training duration. Through careful tuning of each method, we provide guidance
to practitioners on which optimizer is best suited for each scenario. For
researchers, our work highlights promising directions for future optimization
research. Finally, by releasing our code and making all experiments fully
reproducible, we hope our efforts can help the development and rigorous
benchmarking of future methods.

Title: Hierarchical Motion Captioning Utilizing External Text Data Source
Authors: Clayton Leite and Yu Xiao
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance existing motion captioning
methods, which directly map representations of movement to high-level
descriptive captions (e.g., ``a person doing jumping jacks"). The existing
methods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,
``jumping jacks"). However, such data is rarely available in existing
motion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion
descriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.
First, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions
corresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text
datasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening
and closing of legs" for ``jumping jacks"). These refined annotations are used
to retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.
Second, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the
detailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional
text data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise
high-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness
knowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning
accuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text
datasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,
and BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average
performance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L) ranging from 6% to 50%
compared to the state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable.

Title: Prior-Guided Flow Matching for Target-Aware Molecule Design with
  Learnable Atom Number
Authors: Jingyuan Zhou and Hao Qian and Shikui Tu and Lei Xu
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high
binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug
discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they
suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated
molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent
quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware
molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable
atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to
model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow
matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is
incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during
generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information
is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry.
Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow
achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina
Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.

Title: Unsupervised Identification and Replay-based Detection (UIRD) for New
  Category Anomaly Detection in ECG Signal
Authors: Zhangyue Shi, Zekai Wang, Yuxuan Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely
applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of
the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical
outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,
the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In
addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all
historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to
recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,
to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage
limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual
learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised
identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an
unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated
to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical
data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a
generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new
task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous
learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the
newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised
classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show
that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies
while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.

  Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play
crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil,
wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces
significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in
microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN),
optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial
composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference
Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a
clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we
employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to
synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a
result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of
the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be
applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we
demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental
synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial
community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes,
develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.

Title: Forward-Only Continual Learning
Authors: Jiao Chen, Jiayi He, Fangfang Chen, Zuohong Lv, Jianhua Tang
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

Title: Graph Contrastive Learning versus Untrained Baselines: The Role of
  Dataset Size
Authors: Smayan Khanna, Doruk Efe G\"okmen, Risi Kondor, Vincenzo Vitelli
Categories: cs.LG cond-mat.soft
Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-
supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized
datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We
ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find
that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On
standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer
perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the
large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small
scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain
eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales
with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared
with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it
is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications,
as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

Title: Feynman-Kac-Flow: Inference Steering of Conditional Flow Matching to an
  Energy-Tilted Posterior
Authors: Konstantin Mark, Leonard Galustian, Maximilian P.-P. Kovar, Esther
  Heid
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Conditional Flow Matching(CFM) represents a fast and high-quality approach to
generative modelling, but in many applications it is of interest to steer the
generated samples towards precise requirements. While steering approaches like
gradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac
steering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended
to flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as
tilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time,
Feynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic
tasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional
space, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We
then demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously
unsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with
the correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different
handedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways
connecting reactants and products. Code to reproduce this study is avaiable

Title: Model Unmerging: Making Your Models Unmergeable for Secure Model Sharing
Authors: Zihao Wang, Enneng Yang, Lu Yin, Shiwei Liu, Li Shen
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Model merging leverages multiple finetuned expert models to construct a
multi-task model with low cost, and is gaining increasing attention. However,
as a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns
about the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may
infringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.
Most existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from
a specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In
this paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts
model parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing
unauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of
the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two
pairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and
Value-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output
unchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other
finetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks
demonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over
95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its
effectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by
MergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,
further enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging. The code is
available at https://github.com/hetailang/Merge-Lock.

Title: Direct Profit Estimation Using Uplift Modeling under Clustered Network
  Interference
Authors: Bram van den Akker
Categories: cs.LG
Journal-ref: CONSEQUENCES Workshop @ RecSys 2025
\\
  Uplift modeling is a key technique for promotion optimization in recommender
systems, but standard methods typically fail to account for interference, where
treating one item affects the outcomes of others. This violation of the Stable
Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) leads to suboptimal policies in
real-world marketplaces. Recent developments in interference-aware estimators
such as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way
into the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these
estimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology
to bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning
objective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this
framework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to
directly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through
simulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms
interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.
Furthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric uplift strategies within our
framework can yield superior performance in identifying the highest-impact
interventions, offering a practical path toward more profitable incentive
personalization.

Title: Learning Longitudinal Stress Dynamics from Irregular Self-Reports via
  Time Embeddings
Authors: Louis Simon and Mohamed Chetouani
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  The widespread adoption of mobile and wearable sensing technologies has
enabled continuous and personalized monitoring of affect, mood disorders, and
stress. When combined with ecological self-report questionnaires, these systems
offer a powerful opportunity to explore longitudinal modeling of human
behaviors. However, challenges arise from missing data and the irregular timing
of self-reports, which make challenging the prediction of human states and
behaviors. In this study, we investigate the use of time embeddings to capture
time dependencies within sequences of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).
We introduce a novel time embedding method, Ema2Vec, designed to effectively
handle irregularly spaced self-reports, and evaluate it on a new task of
longitudinal stress prediction. Our method outperforms standard stress
prediction baselines that rely on fixed-size daily windows, as well as models
trained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.
These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time embeddings when
modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data.

Title: One-Shot Clustering for Federated Learning Under Clustering-Agnostic
  Assumption
Authors: Maciej Krzysztof Zuziak, Roberto Pellungrini and Salvatore Rinzivillo
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of
decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources
without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since
its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal
with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource
allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with
the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to
deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been
published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic
assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this
work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a
clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest
suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine
distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that
detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate
our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over
forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the
good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated
manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the
practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,
providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering
methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks
trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of
local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more
insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability
of local predictions.

Title: Entropy-Driven Curriculum for Multi-Task Training in Human Mobility
  Prediction
Authors: Tianye Fang, Xuanshu Luo, Martin Werner
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable
devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches.
However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training,
leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile,
exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including
distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This
paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven
curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed
entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory
predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from
simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The
multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction
alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning
realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through
complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in
accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with
up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum
learning.

Title: Effects of Distributional Biases on Gradient-Based Causal Discovery in
  the Bivariate Categorical Case
Authors: Tim Schwabe, Moritz Lange, Laurenz Wiskott, Maribel Acosta
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Gradient-based causal discovery shows great potential for deducing causal
structure from data in an efficient and scalable way. Those approaches however
can be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We
identify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in
entropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal
Distribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts
in some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with
Dirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled
synthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ
two simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or
conditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal
discovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.
We additionally show how the biases can be controlled. An empirical evaluation
of two related, existing approaches indicates that eliminating competition
between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to the presented
biases.

Title: Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via
  Differentiable ADMM-DDP
Authors: Bingheng Wang, Yichao Gao, Tianchen Sun, and Lin Zhao
Categories: cs.LG cs.MA cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for
coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly
coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global
coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general
framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight
agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent
configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in
a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by
reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These
gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR
problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that
becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by
truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for
rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a
challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically
feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures
quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and
adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up
to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Relative Trajectory Balance is equivalent to Trust-PCL

Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in
particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion
models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB)
objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential
generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy
RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an
off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB
within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies
its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an
illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods
achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was
previously reported.

  Generalization

Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Task load detection is essential for optimizing human performance across
diverse applications, yet current models often lack generalizability beyond
narrow experimental domains. While prior research has focused on individual
tasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model
robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends
established cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming
application, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load
annotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX
ratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework.
State-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer
architectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities
and application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain
generalization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently
outperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures
showing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models
trained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel
applications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load
estimation. These findings provide robust baselines and actionable insights for
developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing both
research and practical implementation in human-computer interaction and
adaptive systems.

Title: Distilled Pretraining: A modern lens of Data, In-Context Learning and
  Test-Time Scaling
Authors: Sachin Goyal, David Lopez-Paz, Kartik Ahuja
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  In the past year, distillation has seen a renewed prominence in large
language model (LLM) pretraining, exemplified by the Llama-3.2 and Gemma model
families. While distillation has historically been shown to improve statistical
modeling, its effects on new paradigms that are key to modern LLMs, such as
test-time scaling and in-context learning, remain underexplored. In this work,
we make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with
distillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.
Second, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation
impairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via
induction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled
pretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common
principal factor behind our observations. Finally, using these insights, we
shed light on various design choices for pretraining that should help
practitioners going forward.

Categories: cs.LG cs.NA math.NA stat.ML
Comments: Code will be released upon acceptance
Report-no: PNNL-SA-215622
\\
  Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla"
DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified
DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In
this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that
introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk
networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch
network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic
dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla"
DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks --
advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations --
show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the
accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency.
Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with
the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of
cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its
underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our
variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Machine Learning Engineering Agents
Authors: Sherry Yang, Joy He-Yueya, Percy Liang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting
powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more
experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that
improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much
larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this
setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing
code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient
updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration
actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed
asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,
using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A
program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.
To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial
credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early
(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static
language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the
agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as
reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that
performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with
RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent
scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.

Title: Robust Anomaly Detection through Multi-Modal Autoencoder Fusion for
  Small Vehicle Damage Detection
Authors: Sara Khan, Mehmed Y\"uksel, Frank Kirchner
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: 14 pages, 12 figures, submitted to Elsevier MLWA
\\
  Wear and tear detection in fleet and shared vehicle systems is a critical
challenge, particularly in rental and car-sharing services, where minor damage,
such as dents, scratches, and underbody impacts, often goes unnoticed or is
detected too late. Currently, manual inspection methods are the default
approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast,
state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and
are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access
and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal
architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such
as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the
vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while
avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple
variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them
against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal
model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating
Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to
other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can
integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous
vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.

Title: Succeed or Learn Slowly: Sample Efficient Off-Policy Reinforcement
  Learning for Mobile App Control
Authors: Georgios Papoudakis, Thomas Coste, Jianye Hao, Jun Wang, Kun Shao
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) using foundation models for policy approximations
in multi-turn tasks remains challenging. We identify two main limitations
related to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which
we formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns
typically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative
samples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This
paper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL
algorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample
efficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via
a modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for
positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to
prevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay
(STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further
improving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark,
where it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative
increase), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with
5-60x faster inference.

Title: Convolutional Monge Mapping between EEG Datasets to Support Independent
  Component Labeling
Authors: Austin Meek, Carlos H. Mendoza-Cardenas, and Austin J. Brockmeier
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: Code available at: https://github.com/cniel-ud/ICWaves
\\
  EEG recordings contain rich information about neural activity but are subject
to artifacts, noise, and superficial differences due to sensors, amplifiers,
and filtering. Independent component analysis and automatic labeling of
independent components (ICs) enable artifact removal in EEG pipelines.
Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN) is a recent tool used to
achieve spectral conformity of EEG signals, which was shown to improve deep
neural network approaches for sleep staging. Here we propose a novel extension
of the CMMN method with two alternative approaches to computing the source
reference spectrum the target signals are mapped to: (1) channel-averaged and
$l_1$-normalized barycenter, and (2) a subject-to-subject mapping that finds
the source subject with the closest spectrum to the target subject. Notably,
our extension yields space-time separable filters that can be used to map
between datasets with different numbers of EEG channels. We apply these filters
in an IC classification task, and show significant improvement in recognizing
brain versus non-brain ICs.
  Clinical relevance - EEG recordings are used in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple neuropathologies, including epilepsy and psychosis. While EEG
analysis can benefit from automating artifact removal through independent
component analysis and labeling, differences in recording equipment and context
(the presence of noise from electrical wiring and other devices) may impact the
performance of machine learning models, but these differences can be minimized
by appropriate spectral normalization through filtering.

Title: BM-CL: Bias Mitigation through the lens of Continual Learning
Authors: Lucas Mansilla, Rodrigo Echeveste, Camila Gonzalez, Diego H. Milone,
  Enzo Ferrante
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

Title: Communication-Aware Knowledge Distillation for Federated LLM Fine-Tuning
  over Wireless Networks
Authors: Xinlu Zhang, Na Yan, Yang Su, Yansha Deng, Toktam Mahmoodi
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a
privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune
locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw
data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of
technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle
with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a
framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers
lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However,
transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients
due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM
distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first
propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying
logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the
dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design
an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial
and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods.
Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted
hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the
communication overhead further while providing richer representation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance
compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead
by approximately 50%.

Title: Toward a Unified Benchmark and Taxonomy of Stochastic Environments
Authors: Aryan Amit Barsainyan, Jing Yu Lim, Dianbo Liu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks
such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world
conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often
struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability,
despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely
capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly
simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further
hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI
(STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects
and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of
uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL
environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing
approaches.

Title: A Multi-target Bayesian Transformer Framework for Predicting
  Cardiovascular Disease Biomarkers during Pandemics
Authors: Trusting Inekwe, Emmanuel Agu, Winnie Mkandawire, Andres Colubri
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide,
disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and
behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of
these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding
preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction
of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning
(ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns,
and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target
Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to
jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The
model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties,
embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture
biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data
from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts
during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of
baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887,
RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model
uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via
its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance
highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support
clinical decision-making during pandemics.

Title: When LLM Meets Time Series: Can LLMs Perform Multi-Step Time Series
  Reasoning and Inference
Authors: Wen Ye, Jinbo Liu, Defu Cao, Wei Yang, Yan Liu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their
ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world
application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first
step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work,
we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as
time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical
relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33
real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of
challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with
threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and
multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be
dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task
types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt
task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure
meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight
state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals
limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis
workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for
domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to
changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing
vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple
origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic
graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big
maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination
pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to
select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete
action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind
resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System
(AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We
evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with
recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in
policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive
shaping rewards produces additional gains.

Title: Optimizing In-Context Learning for Efficient Full Conformal Prediction
Authors: Weicao Deng, Sangwoo Park, Min Li, and Osvaldo Simeone
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal
Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP
(SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP
(FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining
complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning
(ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training
procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction
sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP
(E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model
trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models
required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while
markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on
synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior
efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

  Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter
updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers
due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES,
a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer
components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found
that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES
tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during
training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence
threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates
individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow
converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters
when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by
1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early
prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.

  This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared
autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement
learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route
transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve
accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first
make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a
pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns
vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand
fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal
Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based
simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that
after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with
dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized
costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency
gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.
This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and
machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork
for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in
multimodal transit systems.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Drone Routing in Post-Disaster
  Road Assessment Without Domain Knowledge
Authors: Huatian Gong, Jiuh-Biing Sheu, Zheng Wang, Xiaoguang Yang, Ran Yan
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: 36 pages, 15 figures
\\
  Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is critical for effective
emergency response, yet traditional optimization methods suffer from excessive
computational time and require domain knowledge for algorithm design, making
them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios. This study proposes an
attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for real-time drone routing
decision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep
reinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes
without requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method
is developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based
formulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the
scarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy
optimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities
to handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two
key strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 16--69\% in
solution quality and achieves real-time inference (1--2 seconds) versus
100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong
generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time
constraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter
distributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively
balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly
suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid
decision-making is essential for saving lives.

Title: Predicting NCAP Safety Ratings: An Analysis of Vehicle Characteristics
  and ADAS Features Using Machine Learning
Authors: Raunak Kunwar and Aera Kim LeBoulluec (University of Texas at
  Arlington)
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures, Under review
\\
  Vehicle safety assessment is crucial for consumer information and regulatory
oversight. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety
ratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include
active safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).
It is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically.
This study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision
Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot
Detection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight,
Model Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's
likelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a
publicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately
5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four
different machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified
cross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest
and gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.
Analysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics,
specifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability,
contributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model.
However, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive
contributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a
held-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This
research reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data
and highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle
parameters and modern ADAS features to achieve top safety ratings.

Title: VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection for Adaptive
  Regularization
Authors: Tanvir Islam
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive
regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic
noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that
apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes
volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic
projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden
nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable
representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves
generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives.
In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral
properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that
VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters
a more robust feature representation.

Title: A Continuous Encoding-Based Representation for Efficient Multi-Fidelity
  Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Search
Authors: Zhao Wei, Chin Chun Ooi, and Yew-Soon Ong
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the
design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational
budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting
objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity
multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational
cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill
sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for
faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel
continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell
within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search
dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS
algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under
limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow
regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The
proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model
with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good
prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that
the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior
U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing
each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

Title: Knowledge distillation as a pathway toward next-generation intelligent
  ecohydrological modeling systems

Comments: 25 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Simulating ecohydrological processes is essential for understanding complex
environmental systems and guiding sustainable management amid accelerating
climate change and human pressures. Process-based models provide physical
realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and
complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and
flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a
unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and
progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge
distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via
surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower
computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process
equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling
multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III,
cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making
into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture.
Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability
to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model
outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based
decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway
toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the
potential extension to other process-based domains.

Title: Semantic and episodic memories in a predictive coding model of the
  neocortex

\\
  Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two
learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense,
overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory
is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations
and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this
duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by
predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the
neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on
auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic
capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this
paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore
its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall
the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small
number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not
generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic
learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall
capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded
gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in
a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated
representations as found in the hippocampus.

  Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between
projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and
quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for
scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the
distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the
performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize
spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution
information from serious time slices. However, learning future order
distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem
with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture
this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative
spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and
global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior
performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The
main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global
graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional
long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An
innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph
learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to
extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust
future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure
forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
in real-world production environments.

Title: Bouncy particle sampler with infinite exchanging parallel tempering
Authors: Yohei Saito, Shun Kimura, Koujin Takeda
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Bayesian inference is useful to obtain a predictive distribution with a small
generalization error. However, since posterior distributions are rarely
evaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or
sampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples
from a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely
used for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for
the discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle
sampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and
stochastic reflection to perform sampling. BPS was reported to have the
advantage of being easier to set simulation parameters than HMC. To accelerate
the convergence to a posterior distribution, we introduced parallel tempering
(PT) to BPS, and then proposed an algorithm when the inverse temperature
exchange rate is set to infinity. We performed numerical simulations and
demonstrated its effectiveness for multimodal distribution.

Title: Second-Order Tensorial Partial Differential Equations on Graphs
Authors: Aref Einizade, Fragkiskos D. Malliaros, Jhony H. Giraldo
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: 12 pages, 1 figure
\\
  Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is
increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are
mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential
equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such
multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous
approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen
high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these
TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and
heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs
(So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for
second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages
the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement
efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency
information. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph
perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties. Our
theoretical results establish a robust foundation for advancing continuous
graph learning across multiple practical domains.

Title: Genetic Programming with Model Driven Dimension Repair for Learning
  Interpretable Appointment Scheduling Rules
Authors: Huan Zhang, Yang Wang, Ya-Hui Jia, Yi Mei
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication
\\
  Appointment scheduling is a great challenge in healthcare operations
management. Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple
yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming
(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may
lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key
reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that
the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive
understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm
with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high
performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,
which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while
minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the
problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear
programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical
programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our
method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the
dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering
their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential
advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of
simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the
manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP
methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In
addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into
the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.

Title: Fantastic Pretraining Optimizers and Where to Find Them
Authors: Kaiyue Wen, David Hall, Tengyu Ma, Percy Liang

Comments: 108 pages, 8 figures, reproducible runs available at
  https://wandb.ai/marin-community/optimizer-scaling
\\
  AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining,
despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We
posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and
hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited
or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a
systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales
(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).
We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter
tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,
performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one
optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer
unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned
baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for
1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before
reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two
optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our
thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon
and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with
matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based
optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over
AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

Title: Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Data Publication: A Bilevel Optimization
  Framework with Curvature-Guided Perturbation
Authors: Yi Yin, Guangquan Zhang, Hua Zuo, and Jie Lu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR
\\
  Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly
sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference
attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data
perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly
utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and
diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data
utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation
and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework
for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on
data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the
upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that
perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining
fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs
local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of
individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted
privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our
method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are
vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we
achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances
resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in
terms of sample quality and diversity.

Title: LUCIE-3D: A three-dimensional climate emulator for forced responses
Authors: Haiwen Guan, Troy Arcomano, Ashesh Chattopadhyay, Romit Maulik
Categories: cs.LG physics.ao-ph physics.comp-ph
\\
  We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator
designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to
climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term
stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a
Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of
ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model
incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates
prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere
dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces
climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,
including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2
concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as
equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,
while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite
requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,
training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability,
physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid
experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate
dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and
future Earth system emulation.

Title: Data-Dependent Smoothing for Protein Discovery with Walk-Jump Sampling
Authors: Srinivas Anumasa, Barath Chandran.C, Tingting Chen, Dianbo Liu
Categories: cs.LG q-bio.QM
\\
  Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by
learning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate
high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other
complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse
and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,
we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the
majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing
approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we
introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel
density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale
$\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these
data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the
denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of
protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of
data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional
settings.

Title: Abex-rat: Synergizing Abstractive Augmentation and Adversarial Training
  for Classification of Occupational Accident Reports
Authors: Jian Chen, Jinbao Tian, Yunqi Xu, Zhou Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.IR
\\
  The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical
research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk
analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world
datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly
for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable
automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and
efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust
adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep
abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model
to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create
diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a
computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which
stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and
robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public
OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly
outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work
validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient
alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced
classification tasks. The code is publicly available

Title: Towards Comprehensive Information-theoretic Multi-view Learning
Authors: Long Shi, Yunshan Ye, Wenjie Wang, Tao Lei, Yu Zhao, Gang Kou, Badong
  Chen
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Information theory has inspired numerous advancements in multi-view learning.
Most multi-view methods incorporating information-theoretic principles rely an
assumption called multi-view redundancy which states that common information
between views is necessary and sufficient for down-stream tasks. This
assumption emphasizes the importance of common information for prediction, but
inherently ignores the potential of unique information in each view that could
be predictive to the task. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
information-theoretic multi-view learning framework named CIML, which discards
the assumption of multi-view redundancy. Specifically, CIML considers the
potential predictive capabilities of both common and unique information based
on information theory. First, the common representation learning maximizes
Gacs-Korner common information to extract shared features and then compresses
this information to learn task-relevant representations based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB). For unique representation learning, IB is employed
to achieve the most compressed unique representation for each view while
simultaneously minimizing the mutual information between unique and common
representations, as well as among different unique representations.
Importantly, we theoretically prove that the learned joint representation is
predictively sufficient for the downstream task. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated the superiority of our model over several state-of-art
methods. The code is released on CIML.

  Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before
fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new
approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this
setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases.
We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single
model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages
Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring
additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike
existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and
consistently outperforms prior work.

  The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics
and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a
non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning
pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we
present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full
automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and
computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable
EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$
between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in
imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of
$\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides
theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also
introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments
on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and
texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed
approach in different settings.

aiming to select an arm based on its relation to a prescribed threshold \(\tau

\(k^{th}\) arm above or below it, or the closest to it, under a monotonic
structure of arm means. We derive asymptotic regret lower bounds, showing
dependence only on arms adjacent to \(\tau\). Motivated by applications in

  Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high
computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when

framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'
vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior
generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$
computational efficiency gains.

Title: Online Identification of IT Systems through Active Causal Learning
Authors: Kim Hammar and Rolf Stadler
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC cs.NI
\\
  Identifying a causal model of an IT system is fundamental to many branches of
systems engineering and operation. Such a model can be used to predict the
effects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect
intrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of
automating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models
have been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves
increasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT
systems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online,
data-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The
method, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that
capture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using
Gaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected
through a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is
optimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.
Experimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate
identification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with
system operations.

Title: Conditional-$t^3$VAE: Equitable Latent Space Allocation for Fair
  Generation
Authors: Aymene Mohammed Bouayed and Samuel Deslauriers-Gauthier and Adrian
  Iaccovelli and David Naccache
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

Title: Simulating classification models to evaluate Predict-Then-Optimize
  methods
Authors: Pieter Smet
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Uncertainty in optimization is often represented as stochastic parameters in
the optimization model. In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a
machine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively
transforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This
two-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions
result in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,
providing evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained
optimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.
Simulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to
(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without
the need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature
for simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for
simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers. We conduct a computational
study to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and show that classifier
performance can be simulated with reasonable accuracy, although some
variability is observed. Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the
performance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling
problem. The experiments demonstrate that the relationship between prediction
error and how close solutions are to the actual optimum is non-trivial,
highlighting important considerations for the design and evaluation of
decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions.

Title: DaCe AD: Unifying High-Performance Automatic Differentiation for Machine
  Learning and Scientific Computing
Authors: Afif Boudaoud, Alexandru Calotoiu, Marcin Copik, Torsten Hoefler
Categories: cs.LG cs.PF cs.PL
\\
  Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques that systematically
applies the chain rule to compute the gradients of functions without requiring
human intervention. Although the fundamentals of this technology were
established decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key
role in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning
algorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing
domains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning
models within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have
four main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code
modifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing
codes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for
gradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually
compute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a
general, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code
modifications. DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the
trade-off between storing and recomputing to achieve maximum performance within
a given memory constraint. We showcase the generality of our method by applying
it to NPBench, a suite of HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing
patterns, where we outperform JAX, a Python framework with state-of-the-art
general AD capabilities, by more than 92 times on average without requiring any
code changes.

Comments: Baichuan-M2 Technical Report
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning
capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical
research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of
medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world
clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams
fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework
that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,
high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework
comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic
clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical
Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation
metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter
medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement
learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other
open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a
score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously
exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier
system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical
applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter
trade-off for medical AI deployment.

Title: ST-Hyper: Learning High-Order Dependencies Across Multiple
  Spatial-Temporal Scales for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
Authors: Binqing Wu, Jianlong Huang, Zongjiang Shang, Ling Chen
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Accepted by CIKM 2025
\\
  In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based
methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial
(inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods
may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales
(ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In
this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across
multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we
introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features
at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph
Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust
high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these
features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively
capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of
3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.

Title: VariAntNet: Learning Decentralized Control of Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Yigal Koifman, Erez Koifman, Eran Iceland, Ariel Barel and Alfred M.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.MA
\\
  A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response
applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in
complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent
communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known
as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing
capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate
explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in
maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.
Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the
classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep
learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent
swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric
features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It
incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,
differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that
promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph
Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent
gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must
gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing
analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while
maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the
analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In
time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are
at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some
agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in
detail.

Title: Calibration through the Lens of Indistinguishability
Authors: Parikshit Gopalan, Lunjia Hu
Categories: cs.LG cs.GT stat.ML
Comments: This is the full version of a survey that appears in the ACM SIGecom
  Exchanges
\\
  Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims
to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In
a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we
evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible
outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given
the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey
describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and
measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision
makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint
that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between
the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature
or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures
quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain
classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.

Title: Balanced Multimodal Learning: An Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction
  Perspective
Authors: Shijie Wang, Li Zhang, Xinyan Liang, Yuhua Qian, Shen Hu
Categories: cs.LG cs.MM
\\
  Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate
different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint
learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities
overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from
each modality and the inter-modality interaction information.Existing
strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient
modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods
remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it
arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This
limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance
learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective
interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from
individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce
Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the
conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.
UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned
representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,
the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to
the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By
decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI
prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal
feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms
existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance
improvement in multimodal learning tasks.

Title: AdaSwitch: An Adaptive Switching Meta-Algorithm for Learning-Augmented
  Bounded-Influence Problems
Authors: Xi Chen, Yuze Chen, Yuan Zhou
Categories: cs.LG math.OC
Comments: 62 pages, 7 figures
\\
  We study a class of multi-period online decision-making problems with
sequence-based predictions, which may be generated by machine learning models
but whose accuracy is not guaranteed. In each period, the decision-maker
observes the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a
reward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a
bounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only
limited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose
the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance
close to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving
classical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions. Our
framework and meta-algorithm apply to diverse settings, including lead-time
quotation in processing systems, the $k$-server problem, and online allocation
of reusable resources. These applications illustrate the flexibility and broad
applicability of our approach to learning-augmented online decision-making.

Title: Extrapolated Markov Chain Oversampling Method for Imbalanced Text
  Classification
Authors: Aleksi Avela, Pauliina Ilmonen
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Text classification is the task of automatically assigning text documents
correct labels from a predefined set of categories. In real-life (text)
classification tasks, observations and misclassification costs are often
unevenly distributed between the classes - known as the problem of imbalanced
data. Synthetic oversampling is a popular approach to imbalanced
classification. The idea is to generate synthetic observations in the minority
class to balance the classes in the training set. Many general-purpose
oversampling methods can be applied to text data; however, imbalanced text data
poses a number of distinctive difficulties that stem from the unique nature of
text compared to other domains. One such factor is that when the sample size of
text increases, the sample vocabulary (i.e., feature space) is likely to grow
as well. We introduce a novel Markov chain based text oversampling method. The
transition probabilities are estimated from the minority class but also partly
from the majority class, thus allowing the minority feature space to expand in
oversampling. We evaluate our approach against prominent oversampling methods
and show that our approach is able to produce highly competitive results
against the other methods in several real data examples, especially when the
imbalance is severe.

Title: RDIT: Residual-based Diffusion Implicit Models for Probabilistic Time
  Series Forecasting
Authors: Chih-Yu Lai, Yu-Chien Ning, and Duane S. Boning
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains
requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making.
However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer
from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found
that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose
standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art
performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework
that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a
bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard
deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.
Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons
demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved
coverage compared to strong baselines.

Authors: Dongseok Kim, Wonjun Jeong, Gisung Oh
Categories: cs.LG cs.GT stat.ML
Comments: 51 pages, 7 figures
\\
  The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants
take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task
but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this
perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to
clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge
from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that
respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss,
and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of
operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure,
evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds,
auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be
applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for
allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations
conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns
predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full
reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several
assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and
connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of
real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational
guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and
expanding stable cooperation.

Title: Evaluating Cumulative Spectral Gradient as a Complexity Measure
Authors: Haji Gul, Abdul Ghani Naim, Ajaz Ahmad Bhat
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

\\
  The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central
role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such
estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how
information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and
determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is
essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant
information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher
information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it
from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance
corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that
training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This
provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the
need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance
of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging
experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

Title: Cache Management for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs -- extended version

DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-99872-0_2
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful
deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions
of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been
proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated
when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently
managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts
should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.
  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert
management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture
of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first
present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like
policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a
layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.
  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE
usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging
problem, such as the standard LRU.

Title: Learnable Loss Geometries with Mirror Descent for Scalable and
  Convergent Meta-Learning
Authors: Yilang Zhang, Bingcong Li, Georgios B. Giannakis
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Utilizing task-invariant knowledge acquired from related tasks as prior
information, meta-learning offers a principled approach to learning a new task
with limited data records. Sample-efficient adaptation of this prior
information is a major challenge facing meta-learning, and plays an important
role because it facilitates training the sought task-specific model with just a
few optimization steps. Past works deal with this challenge through
preconditioning that speeds up convergence of the per-task training. Though
effective in representing locally quadratic loss curvatures, simple linear
preconditioning can be hardly potent with complex loss geometries. Instead of
relying on a quadratic distance metric, the present contribution copes with
complex loss metrics by learning a versatile distance-generating function,
which induces a nonlinear mirror map to effectively capture and optimize a wide
range of loss geometries. With suitable parameterization, this generating
function is effected by an expressive neural network that is provably a valid
distance. Analytical results establish convergence of not only the proposed
method, but also all meta-learning approaches based on preconditioning. To
attain gradient norm less than $\epsilon$, the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ is on par with standard gradient-based
meta-learning methods. Numerical tests on few-shot learning datasets
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the novel algorithm, as well
as its rapid per-task convergence, which markedly reduces the number of
adaptation steps, hence also accommodating large-scale meta-learning models.

Title: VASSO: Variance Suppression for Sharpness-Aware Minimization
Authors: Bingcong Li, Yilang Zhang, Georgios B. Giannakis
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well-documented merits in enhancing
generalization of deep neural network models. Accounting for sharpness in the
loss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten
generalization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss
provoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although
critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers
from `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters
stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers
a general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when
integrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated
on extensive vision and language tasks. Once applied on top of a
computationally efficient SAM variant, VASSO offers a desirable
generalization-computation tradeoff.

  Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely
and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex
sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility
and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face
practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to
distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with
explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a
Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as
return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and
modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with
CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile
regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system
with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference.
Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show
that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity
while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent,
the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification
decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more
relevant.

Title: Exploring Variational Graph Autoencoders for Distribution Grid Data
  Generation
Authors: Syed Zain Abbas and Ehimare Okoyomon
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  To address the lack of public power system data for machine learning research
in energy networks, we investigate the use of variational graph autoencoders
(VGAEs) for synthetic distribution grid generation. Using two open-source
datasets, ENGAGE and DINGO, we evaluate four decoder variants and compare
generated networks against the original grids using structural and spectral
metrics. Results indicate that simple decoders fail to capture realistic
topologies, while GCN-based approaches achieve strong fidelity on ENGAGE but
struggle on the more complex DINGO dataset, producing artifacts such as

Title: SimpleTIR: End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn
  Tool-Integrated Reasoning
Authors: Zhenghai Xue, Longtao Zheng, Qian Liu, Yingru Li, Xiaosen Zheng, Zejun

Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning
capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios
using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and
performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by
a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation
of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing
catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To
address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that
stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter
out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code
block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the
policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude
gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math
reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only
baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.
Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR
encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,
such as self-correction and cross-validation.

Title: HydroGAT: Distributed Heterogeneous Graph Attention Transformer for
  Spatiotemporal Flood Prediction

  Geographic Information Systems (SIGSPATIAL 25)
DOI: 10.1145/3748636.3764172
\\
  Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management,
as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g.,
rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions
across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as
convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological
information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate
information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning
hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction
models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training
explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing
methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying
GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,
thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for
accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every
land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow
directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a
spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the
most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and
across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),
improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly
discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal
sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution
basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that
scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,
demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at

\\
  B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal
specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the
verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when
handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are
increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model
checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data
becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages
derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word
sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize
to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas
corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from
3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target
$\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer
than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or
near-perfect generalization. These results establish the feasibility of neural
approaches for learning complex $\omega$-regular languages, suggesting their
potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.

Title: MoPEQ: Mixture of Mixed Precision Quantized Experts
Authors: Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata, Jie Ye, Murali Emani
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: Accepted by ICCV Bivision Workshop 2025
\\
  Large Language and Vision Models using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture pose significant challenges for deployment due to their
computational and memory demands. Mixed Precision Quantization assigns
different precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer
sensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post
Training Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each
expert. Our method balances accuracy and model size by analyzing each expert's
sensitivity using Hessian trace approximation instead of relying on the
activation frequency of the expert. This per-expert granularity approach
clusters similar experts to maintain model performance while reducing memory
requirements. The experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmark datasets using
State-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 -tiny, -small, -base, and MolmoE models
demonstrate that our mixed precision quantized MoEs achieve competitive
accuracy with substantial improvements in memory footprint compared to
uniform-precision baseline methods. We perform a comprehensive study to analyze
the impact of expert activation frequency and sensitivity using Hessian trace
approximation at both layer-wise and model-wide expert precision allocation of
2, 3, and 4 bits to provide a thorough understanding of mixed precision
quantization of VLM-MoEs.

Authors: Wenlong Mou

  We study the problem of learning the optimal control policy for fine-tuning a
given diffusion process, using general value function approximation. We develop
a new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates
for the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity
and approximation errors of the function class. In contrast to generic
reinforcement learning problems, our approach shows that fine-tuning can be
achieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees.

  Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models
into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and
their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several
existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance
the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for
model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is
computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we
develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to
realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define
two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to
predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate
that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and
simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

  Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing
chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian
models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We
propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined
policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not
addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that
articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match
static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while
identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to
frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

Title: Understanding sparse autoencoder scaling in the presence of feature
  manifolds
Authors: Eric J. Michaud, Liv Gorton, Tom McGrath
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: 13 pages, 8 figures, short workshop submission
\\
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as
linear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents).
The ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the
number of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the
neural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in
particular, to understand how "feature manifolds" (multi-dimensional features)
influence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers
distinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the
pathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than
there are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether
or not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.

  Despite recent progress, Graphic User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex mobile tasks due to limited
app-specific knowledge. While UI Transition Graphs (UTGs) offer structured
navigation representations, they are underutilized due to poor extraction and
inefficient integration. We introduce KG-RAG, a Knowledge Graph-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that transforms fragmented UTGs into
structured vector databases for efficient real-time retrieval. By leveraging an
intent-guided LLM search method, KG-RAG generates actionable navigation paths,
enhancing agent decision-making. Experiments across diverse mobile apps show
that KG-RAG outperforms existing methods, achieving a 75.8% success rate (8.9%
improvement over AutoDroid), 84.6% decision accuracy (8.1% improvement), and
reducing average task steps from 4.5 to 4.1. Additionally, we present
KG-Android-Bench and KG-Harmony-Bench, two benchmarks tailored to the Chinese
mobile ecosystem for future research. Finally, KG-RAG transfers to web/desktop
(+40% SR on Weibo-web; +20% on QQ Music-desktop), and a UTG cost ablation shows
accuracy saturates at ~4h per complex app, enabling practical deployment
trade-offs.

  With the rapid advancement of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), GUI-based mobile

Title: Nash Q-Network for Multi-Agent Cybersecurity Simulation
Authors: Qintong Xie, Edward Koh, Xavier Cadet, Peter Chin

Comments: Accepted at GameSec 2025
\\
  Cybersecurity defense involves interactions between adversarial parties
(namely defenders and hackers), making multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) an ideal approach for modeling and learning strategies for these
scenarios. This paper addresses one of the key challenges to MARL, the
complexity of simultaneous training of agents in nontrivial environments, and
presents a novel policy-based Nash Q-learning to directly converge onto a
steady equilibrium. We demonstrate the successful implementation of this
algorithm in a notable complex cyber defense simulation treated as a two-player
zero-sum Markov game setting. We propose the Nash Q-Network, which aims to
learn Nash-optimal strategies that translate to robust defenses in
cybersecurity settings. Our approach incorporates aspects of proximal policy
optimization (PPO), deep Q-network (DQN), and the Nash-Q algorithm, addressing
common challenges like non-stationarity and instability in multi-agent
learning. The training process employs distributed data collection and
carefully designed neural architectures for both agents and critics.

Title: Controller synthesis method for multi-agent system based on temporal
  logic specification
Authors: Ruohan Huang, Zining Cao
Categories: cs.MA cs.FL cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Controller synthesis is a theoretical approach to the systematic design of
discrete event systems. It constructs a controller to provide feedback and
control to the system, ensuring it meets specified control specifications.
Traditional controller synthesis methods often use formal languages to describe
control specifications and are mainly oriented towards single-agent and
non-probabilistic systems. With the increasing complexity of systems, the
control requirements that need to be satisfied also become more complex. Based
on this, this paper proposes a controller synthesis method for semi-cooperative
semi-competitive multi-agent probabilistic discrete event systems to solve the
controller synthesis problem based on temporal logic specifications. The
controller can ensure the satisfaction of specifications to a certain extent.
The specification is given in the form of a linear temporal logic formula. This
paper designs a controller synthesis algorithm that combines probabilistic
model checking. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified through a
case study.

Comments: 21 Pages
\\
  Drug shortages pose critical risks to patient care and healthcare systems
worldwide, yet the effectiveness of regulatory interventions remains poorly
understood due to fundamental information asymmetries in pharmaceutical supply
chains. We present \textbf{ShortageSim}, the first Large Language Model
(LLM)-based multi-agent simulation framework that captures the complex,
strategic interactions between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and
regulatory agencies in response to shortage alerts. Unlike traditional
game-theoretic models that assume perfect rationality and complete information,
\textbf{ShortageSim} leverages LLMs to simulate bounded-rational
decision-making under uncertainty. Through a sequential production game
spanning multiple quarters, we model how FDA announcements, both reactive
alerts about existing shortages and proactive warnings about potential
disruptions, propagate through the supply chain and influence capacity
investment and procurement decisions. Our experiments on historical shortage
events reveal that \textbf{ShortageSim} reduces the resolution-lag percentage
for discontinued-disclosed cases by 83\%, bringing simulated durations more
aligned to ground truth than the zero-shot baseline. We open-source
\textbf{ShortageSim} and a dataset of 2,925 FDA shortage events at
https://github.com/Lemutisme/Sortage_Management, providing a novel
computational framework for designing and testing interventions in complex,
information-scarce supply chains.

Title: Traj-MLLM: Can Multimodal Large Language Models Reform Trajectory Data
  Mining?
Authors: Shuo Liu, Di Yao, Yan Lin, Gao Cong, Jingping Bi
Categories: cs.MM cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: 20 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Building a general model capable of analyzing human trajectories across
different geographic regions and different tasks becomes an emergent yet
important problem for various applications. However, existing works suffer from
the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for
specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs
reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due
to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal
trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain
the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}},
which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By
integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories
into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal
characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for
trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to
finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on
four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on
travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and
transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves
these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning
the MLLM backbones.

  Recognition

\\
  Understanding human intents from multimodal signals is critical for analyzing
human behaviors and enhancing human-machine interactions in real-world
scenarios. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in their
modality-level reliance, constraining relational reasoning over fine-grained
semantics for complex intent understanding. This paper proposes a novel
LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning (LGSRR) method, which harnesses the
expansive knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to establish semantic
foundations that boost smaller models' relational reasoning performance.
Specifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained
semantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks
semantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors.
Besides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations
grounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable
more effective relational reasoning. Extensive experiments on multimodal intent
and dialogue act recognition tasks demonstrate LGSRR's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods, with consistent performance gains across diverse
semantic understanding scenarios. The complete data and code are available at

  Storage and transmission challenges in dynamic 3D scene representation based
on the i3DV platform, With increasing scene complexity, the explosive growth of
3D Gaussian data volume causes excessive storage space occupancy. To address
this issue, we propose adopting the AVS PCRM reference software for efficient
compression of Gaussian point cloud geometry data. The strategy deeply
integrates the advanced encoding capabilities of AVS PCRM into the i3DV
platform, forming technical complementarity with the original rate-distortion
optimization mechanism based on binary hash tables. On one hand, the hash table
efficiently caches inter-frame Gaussian point transformation relationships,
which allows for high-fidelity transmission within a 40 Mbps bandwidth
constraint. On the other hand, AVS PCRM performs precise compression on
geometry data. Experimental results demonstrate that the joint framework
maintains the advantages of fast rendering and high-quality synthesis in 3D
Gaussian technology while achieving significant 10\%-25\% bitrate savings on
universal test sets. It provides a superior rate-distortion tradeoff solution
for the storage, transmission, and interaction of 3D volumetric video.

Title: Per-sender neural network classifiers for email authorship validation
Authors: Rohit Dube

Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables
\\
  Business email compromise and lateral spear phishing attacks are among modern
organizations' most costly and damaging threats. While inbound phishing
defenses have improved significantly, most organizations still trust internal
emails by default, leaving themselves vulnerable to attacks from compromised
employee accounts. In this work, we define and explore the problem of
authorship validation: verifying whether a claimed sender actually authored a
given email. Authorship validation is a lightweight, real-time defense that
complements traditional detection methods by modeling per-sender writing style.
Further, the paper presents a collection of new datasets based on the Enron
corpus. These simulate inauthentic messages using both human-written and large
language model-generated emails. The paper also evaluates two classifiers -- a
Naive Bayes model and a character-level convolutional neural network (Char-CNN)
-- for the authorship validation task. Our experiments show that the Char-CNN
model achieves high accuracy and F1 scores under various circumstances.
Finally, we discuss deployment considerations and show that per-sender
authorship classifiers are practical for integrating into existing commercial
email security systems with low overhead.

Numerical experiments compare the MDP-based approach against baseline policies
including random allocation, greedy renewable expansion, and expert heuristics.
Results demonstrate that equity-focused optimization can achieve 32.9%
renewable energy penetration while reducing underserved low-income populations
by 55% compared to conventional approaches. The expert policy achieved the
highest reward, while the Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline provided competitive
performance with significantly lower budget utilization, demonstrating that
fair distribution of clean energy resources is achievable without sacrificing
overall system performance and providing ways for integrating social equity
considerations with climate goals and inclusive access to clean power
infrastructure.

Title: A Fluid Antenna Enabled Physical Layer Key Generation for Next-G
  Wireless Networks
Authors: Jiacheng Guo and Ning Gao and Yiping Zuo and Hao Xu and Shi Jin and
  Kai Kit Wong
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI cs.CR cs.IT math.IT
\\
  As a promising physical layer security technique, physical layer key
generation (PLKG) enables legitimate users to obtain secret keys from wireless
channel without security infrastructures. However, in harsh propagation
environments, the channel characteristic becomes unsatisfactory, the key
generation rate (KGR) is significantly deteriorated. In this paper, we propose
a novel fluid antenna (FA) enabled PLKG system to address this challenge.
Specifically, we first derive the closed-form expression of the KGR for FA
array, and then jointly optimize the precoding matrix and the antenna positions
via a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Next, to further reduce the
computational complexity of the optimization procedure, we develop an
alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which combines the projected gradient
descent (PGD) and the PSO. Simulation results demonstrate that by exploiting
the additional spatial degree of freedom (DoF), our FA enabled PLKG system is
superior to the benchmarks, such as the conventional fixed-position antenna
(FPA) array and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). It is worth
highlighting that compared to the conventional uniform planar antenna (UPA),
the FA enabled PLKG achieves a 35.42\% KGR performance improvement under PSO
algorithm and a 67.73\% KGR performance improvement under AO algorithm,
respectively.

Title: DeepEmoNet: Building Machine Learning Models for Automatic Emotion
  Recognition in Human Speeches
Authors: Tai Vu
Categories: eess.AS cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Speech emotion recognition (SER) has been a challenging problem in spoken
language processing research, because it is unclear how human emotions are
connected to various components of sounds such as pitch, loudness, and energy.
This paper aims to tackle this problem using machine learning. Particularly, we
built several machine learning models using SVMs, LTSMs, and CNNs to classify
emotions in human speeches. In addition, by leveraging transfer learning and
data augmentation, we efficiently trained our models to attain decent
performances on a relatively small dataset. Our best model was a ResNet34
network, which achieved an accuracy of $66.7\%$ and an F1 score of $0.631$.

\\
  Conventional music visualisation systems rely on handcrafted ad hoc
transformations of shapes and colours that offer only limited expressiveness.
We propose two novel pipelines for automatically generating music videos from
any user-specified, vocal or instrumental song using off-the-shelf deep
learning models. Inspired by the manual workflows of music video producers, we
experiment on how well latent feature-based techniques can analyse audio to
detect musical qualities, such as emotional cues and instrumental patterns, and
distil them into textual scene descriptions using a language model. Next, we
employ a generative model to produce the corresponding video clips. To assess
the generated videos, we identify several critical aspects and design and
conduct a preliminary user evaluation that demonstrates storytelling potential,
visual coherency and emotional alignment with the music. Our findings
underscore the potential of latent feature techniques and deep generative
models to expand music visualisation beyond traditional approaches.

Title: Lightning Fast Caching-based Parallel Denoising Prediction for
  Accelerating Talking Head Generation
Authors: Jianzhi Long, Wenhao Sun, Rongcheng Tu, Dacheng Tao
Categories: cs.GR cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic
videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications.
Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the
temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this
paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies
through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based
Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass
most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using
cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing
sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to
further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in
talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions.
Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra
speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

  An LLM-Driven Approach with Graph Chain-of-Thought
Authors: Haimei Pan, Jiyun Zhang, Qinxi Wei, Xiongnan Jin, Chen Xinkai, Jie

Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Fire is a highly destructive disaster, but effective prevention can
significantly reduce its likelihood of occurrence. When it happens, deploying
emergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human
responders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and
disaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete
perception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To
enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire
scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire
prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency
response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph
(IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs
from real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide
interpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component
configuration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and
real-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical
application value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making.

  Long-horizon Tasks
Authors: Tongtong Feng, Xin Wang, Feilin Han, Leping Zhang, Wenwu Zhu
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.MA cs.MM
\\
  Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for
advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on
specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world
deployment for LH tasks. LH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks,
requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining persistent states, and
adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData-2, the first
large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for LH tasks and the first
scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop
verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous
collaborative flights for LH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120
hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames.
This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and
airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the
customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes,
and LH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to
collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify
algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData-2 also introduces an LH task for
wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models.

  Error Detection, Localization, Explanation, and Revision
Authors: Yuyang Wu, Jinhui Ye, Shuhao Zhang, Lu Dai, Yonatan Bisk, Olexandr

Categories: physics.chem-ph cs.AI
Comments: 9 pages
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown growing potential in molecular
sciences, but they often produce chemically inaccurate descriptions and
struggle to recognize or justify potential errors. This raises important
concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To
support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the
MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction
in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on
molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes
fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying,
localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors
in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193
fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple
annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the
correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and
verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of
current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the
need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities. MolErr2Fix provides a
focused benchmark for evaluating such capabilities and aims to support progress
toward more reliable and chemically informed language models. All annotations
and an accompanying evaluation API will be publicly released to facilitate
future research.

Title: Amplifying Emotional Signals: Data-Efficient Deep Learning for Robust
  Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Tai Vu
Categories: eess.AS cs.AI cs.CL cs.SD
\\
  Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) presents a significant yet persistent
challenge in human-computer interaction. While deep learning has advanced
spoken language processing, achieving high performance on limited datasets
remains a critical hurdle. This paper confronts this issue by developing and
evaluating a suite of machine learning models, including Support Vector
Machines (SVMs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), for automated emotion classification in human speech.
We demonstrate that by strategically employing transfer learning and innovative
data augmentation techniques, our models can achieve impressive performance
despite the constraints of a relatively small dataset. Our most effective
model, a ResNet34 architecture, establishes a new performance benchmark on the
combined RAVDESS and SAVEE datasets, attaining an accuracy of 66.7% and an F1
score of 0.631. These results underscore the substantial benefits of leveraging
pre-trained models and data augmentation to overcome data scarcity, thereby
paving the way for more robust and generalizable SER systems.

\\
  Effective Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) relies upon accurately structured
and semantically enriched information extracted from cybersecurity system logs.
However, current methodologies often struggle to identify and interpret
malicious events reliably and transparently, particularly in cases involving
unstructured or ambiguous log entries. In this work, we propose a novel
methodology that combines ontology-driven structured outputs with Large
Language Models (LLMs), to build an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that
improves the accuracy and explainability of information extraction from
cybersecurity logs. Central to our approach is the integration of domain
ontologies and SHACL-based constraints to guide the language model's output
structure and enforce semantic validity over the resulting graph. Extracted
information is organized into an ontology-enriched graph database, enabling
future semantic analysis and querying. The design of our methodology is
motivated by the analytical requirements associated with honeypot log data,
which typically comprises predominantly malicious activity. While our case
study illustrates the relevance of this scenario, the experimental evaluation
is conducted using publicly available datasets. Results demonstrate that our
method achieves higher accuracy in information extraction compared to
traditional prompt-only approaches, with a deliberate focus on extraction
quality rather than processing speed.

Title: Private, Verifiable, and Auditable AI Systems
Authors: Tobin South
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.CY
Comments: PhD thesis
\\
  The growing societal reliance on artificial intelligence necessitates robust
frameworks for ensuring its security, accountability, and trustworthiness. This
thesis addresses the complex interplay between privacy, verifiability, and
auditability in modern AI, particularly in foundation models. It argues that
technical solutions that integrate these elements are critical for responsible
AI innovation. Drawing from international policy contributions and technical
research to identify key risks in the AI pipeline, this work introduces novel
technical solutions for critical privacy and verifiability challenges.
Specifically, the research introduces techniques for enabling verifiable and
auditable claims about AI systems using zero-knowledge cryptography; utilizing
secure multi-party computation and trusted execution environments for
auditable, confidential deployment of large language models and information
retrieval; and implementing enhanced delegation mechanisms, credentialing
systems, and access controls to secure interactions with autonomous and
multi-agent AI systems. Synthesizing these technical advancements, this
dissertation presents a cohesive perspective on balancing privacy,
verifiability, and auditability in foundation model-based AI systems, offering
practical blueprints for system designers and informing policy discussions on
AI safety and governance.

Title: AEGIS : Automated Co-Evolutionary Framework for Guarding Prompt
  Injections Schema
Authors: Ting-Chun Liu and Ching-Yu Hsu and Kuan-Yi Lee and Chi-An Fu and
  Hung-yi Lee
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Prompt injection attacks pose a significant challenge to the safe deployment
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. While prompt-based
detection offers a lightweight and interpretable defense strategy, its
effectiveness has been hindered by the need for manual prompt engineering. To
address this issue, we propose AEGIS , an Automated co-Evolutionary framework
for Guarding prompt Injections Schema. Both attack and defense prompts are
iteratively optimized against each other using a gradient-like natural language
prompt optimization technique. This framework enables both attackers and
defenders to autonomously evolve via a Textual Gradient Optimization (TGO)
module, leveraging feedback from an LLM-guided evaluation loop. We evaluate our
system on a real-world assignment grading dataset of prompt injection attacks
and demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines,
achieving superior robustness in both attack success and detection.
Specifically, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 1.0, representing an
improvement of 0.26 over the baseline. For detection, the true positive rate
(TPR) improves by 0.23 compared to the previous best work, reaching 0.84, and
the true negative rate (TNR) remains comparable at 0.89. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of co-evolution, gradient buffering, and multi-objective
optimization. We also confirm that this framework is effective in different
LLMs. Our results highlight the promise of adversarial training as a scalable
and effective approach for guarding prompt injections.

\\
  Assessing spoken language is challenging, and quantifying pronunciation
metrics for machine learning models is even harder. However, for the Holy
Quran, this task is simplified by the rigorous recitation rules (tajweed)
established by Muslim scholars, enabling highly effective assessment. Despite
this advantage, the scarcity of high-quality annotated data remains a
significant barrier.
  In this work, we bridge these gaps by introducing: (1) A 98% automated
pipeline to produce high-quality Quranic datasets -- encompassing: Collection
of recitations from expert reciters, Segmentation at pause points (waqf) using
our fine-tuned wav2vec2-BERT model, Transcription of segments, Transcript
verification via our novel Tasmeea algorithm; (2) 850+ hours of audio (~300K
annotated utterances); (3) A novel ASR-based approach for pronunciation error
detection, utilizing our custom Quran Phonetic Script (QPS) to encode Tajweed
rules (unlike the IPA standard for Modern Standard Arabic). QPS uses a
two-level script: (Phoneme level): Encodes Arabic letters with short/long
vowels. (Sifa level): Encodes articulation characteristics of every phoneme. We
further include comprehensive modeling with our novel multi-level CTC Model
which achieved 0.16% average Phoneme Error Rate (PER) on the testset. We
release all code, data, and models as open-source:

  This study explores how virtual environments and artificial intelligence can
enhance university students' learning experiences, with particular attention to
the digital preferences of Generation Z. An experiment was conducted at the
Faculty of Pedagogy, Humanities, and Social Sciences at University of Gyor,
where Walter's Cube technology and a trained AI mediator were integrated into
the instruction of ten philosophical topics. The curriculum was aligned with
the official syllabus and enriched with visual content, quotations, and
explanatory texts related to iconic figures in philosophy. A total of 77
first-year undergraduate students from full-time humanities and social sciences
programs participated in the study. Following their end-of-semester offline
written examination, students voluntarily completed a paper-based, anonymous
ten-question test and provided feedback on the method's effectiveness. No
sensitive personal data were collected, and the research was conducted with
formal approval from the Faculty Dean. Descriptive statistics and inferential
tests were applied to evaluate the impact of the virtual environment and AI
mediation on learning outcomes. Results indicate that 80 percent of
participants achieved good or excellent final exam grades, and the majority
rated the virtual material as highly effective. Qualitative feedback emphasized
increased motivation and deeper engagement, attributed to the immersive 3D
presentation and interactive AI support. This research contributes to the
advancement of digital pedagogy and suggests new directions for applying
virtual and AI-based methods in higher education, particularly in disciplines
where abstract reasoning and conceptual understanding are central.

Title: Meta-learning ecological priors from large language models explains
  human learning and decision making
Authors: Akshay K. Jagadish, Mirko Thalmann, Julian Coda-Forno, Marcel Binz,
  and Eric Schulz
Categories: q-bio.NC cs.AI
\\
  Human cognition is profoundly shaped by the environments in which it unfolds.
Yet, it remains an open question whether learning and decision making can be
explained as a principled adaptation to the statistical structure of real-world
tasks. We introduce ecologically rational analysis, a computational framework
that unifies the normative foundations of rational analysis with ecological
grounding. Leveraging large language models to generate ecologically valid
cognitive tasks at scale, and using meta-learning to derive rational models
optimized for these environments, we develop a new class of learning
algorithms: Ecologically Rational Meta-learned Inference (ERMI). ERMI
internalizes the statistical regularities of naturalistic problem spaces and
adapts flexibly to novel situations, without requiring hand-crafted heuristics
or explicit parameter updates. We show that ERMI captures human behavior across
15 experiments spanning function learning, category learning, and decision
making, outperforming several established cognitive models in trial-by-trial
prediction. Our results suggest that much of human cognition may reflect
adaptive alignment to the ecological structure of the problems we encounter in
everyday life.

Title: Embodied AI: Emerging Risks and Opportunities for Policy Action

Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.RO
\\
  The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI
can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. Given
recent innovations in large language and multimodal models, along with
increasingly advanced and responsive hardware, EAI systems are rapidly growing
in capabilities and operational domains. These advances present significant
risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, and
economic and societal disruption. However, these risks have been severely
overlooked by policymakers. Existing policies, such as international standards
for industrial robots or statutes governing autonomous vehicles, are
insufficient to address the full range of concerns. While lawmakers are
increasingly focused on AI, there is now an urgent need to extend and adapt
existing frameworks to account for the unique risks of EAI. To help bridge this
gap, this paper makes three contributions: first, we provide a foundational
taxonomy of key physical, informational, economic, and social EAI risks.
Secondly, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to identify how existing
frameworks address these risks and where these policies leave critical gaps. We
conclude by offering concrete policy recommendations to address the coming wave
of EAI innovation, including mandatory testing and certification for EAI
systems, clarified liability frameworks, and forward-looking strategies to
manage and prepare for transformative economic and societal impacts.

Title: A Whole New World: Creating a Parallel-Poisoned Web Only AI-Agents Can
  See
Authors: Shaked Zychlinski
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.CY
Comments: 10 pages, 1 figure
\\
  This paper introduces a novel attack vector that leverages website cloaking
techniques to compromise autonomous web-browsing agents powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs). As these agents become more prevalent, their unique and
often homogenous digital fingerprints - comprising browser attributes,
automation framework signatures, and network characteristics - create a new,
distinguishable class of web traffic. The attack exploits this
fingerprintability. A malicious website can identify an incoming request as
originating from an AI agent and dynamically serve a different, "cloaked"
version of its content. While human users see a benign webpage, the agent is
presented with a visually identical page embedded with hidden, malicious
instructions, such as indirect prompt injections. This mechanism allows
adversaries to hijack agent behavior, leading to data exfiltration, malware
execution, or misinformation propagation, all while remaining completely
invisible to human users and conventional security crawlers. This work
formalizes the threat model, details the mechanics of agent fingerprinting and
cloaking, and discusses the profound security implications for the future of
agentic AI, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses against this
stealthy and scalable attack.

  Existing AI Music composition tools are limited in generation duration,
musical quality, and controllability. We introduce CoComposer, a multi-agent
system that consists of five collaborating agents, each with a task based on
the traditional music composition workflow. Using the AudioBox-Aesthetics
system, we experimentally evaluate CoComposer on four compositional criteria.
We test with three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3-0324, Gemini-2.5-Flash), and find
(1) that CoComposer outperforms existing multi-agent LLM-based systems in music
quality, and (2) compared to a single-agent system, in production complexity.
Compared to non- LLM MusicLM, CoComposer has better interpretability and
editability, although MusicLM still produces better music.

unstructured text (with high noise) and paragraphs with domain-specific terms.
In this setting, relation triple extraction (RTE), together with term
extraction, constitutes the first stage toward AOG. This work proposes an
open-source large language model (LLM)-assisted approach to RTE for SES.
Instead of solely relying on prompt-engineering-based methods, this study
promotes the use of LLMs as an aid in constructing ontologies and explores an
effective AOG workflow that includes document segmentation, candidate term
mining, LLM-based relation inference, term normalization, and cross-section
alignment. Golden-standard benchmarks at three granularities are constructed
and used to evaluate the ontology generated from the study. The results show
that it is comparable and potentially superior to the OpenIE method of triple
extraction.

Title: Scaling Legal AI: Benchmarking Mamba and Transformers for Statutory
  Classification and Case Law Retrieval
Authors: Anuraj Maurya
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  The rapid growth of statutory corpora and judicial decisions requires
scalable legal AI systems capable of classification and retrieval over
extremely long contexts. Transformer-based architectures (e.g., Longformer,
DeBERTa) dominate current legal NLP benchmarks but struggle with quadratic
attention costs, limiting efficiency and scalability. In this work, we present
the first comprehensive benchmarking of Mamba, a state-space model (SSM) with
linear-time selective mechanisms, against leading transformer models for
statutory classification and case law retrieval. We evaluate models on
open-source legal corpora including LexGLUE, EUR-Lex, and ILDC, covering
statutory tagging, judicial outcome prediction, and case retrieval tasks.
Metrics include accuracy, recall at k, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and
normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG), alongside throughput measured in
tokens per second and maximum context length. Results show that Mamba's linear
scaling enables processing of legal documents several times longer than
transformers, while maintaining or surpassing retrieval and classification
performance. This study introduces a new legal NLP benchmark suite for
long-context modeling, along with open-source code and datasets to support
reproducibility. Our findings highlight trade-offs between state-space models
and transformers, providing guidance for deploying scalable legal AI in
statutory analysis, judicial decision support, and policy research.

Title: Pilot Study on Generative AI and Critical Thinking in Higher Education
  Classrooms

\\
  Generative AI (GAI) tools have seen rapid adoption in educational settings,
yet their role in fostering critical thinking remains underexplored. While
previous studies have examined GAI as a tutor for specific lessons or as a tool
for completing assignments, few have addressed how students critically evaluate
the accuracy and appropriateness of GAI-generated responses. This pilot study
investigates students' ability to apply structured critical thinking when
assessing Generative AI outputs in introductory Computational and Data Science
courses. Given that GAI tools often produce contextually flawed or factually
incorrect answers, we designed learning activities that require students to
analyze, critique, and revise AI-generated solutions. Our findings offer
initial insights into students' ability to engage critically with GAI content
and lay the groundwork for more comprehensive studies in future semesters.

  Rapid advancements in generative modeling have made synthetic audio
generation easy, making speech-based services vulnerable to spoofing attacks.
Consequently, there is a dire need for robust countermeasures more than ever.
Existing solutions for deepfake detection are often criticized for lacking
generalizability and fail drastically when applied to real-world data. This
study proposes a novel method for generalizable spoofing detection leveraging
non-semantic universal audio representations. Extensive experiments have been
performed to find suitable non-semantic features using TRILL and TRILLsson
models. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves comparable
performance on the in-domain test set while significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches on out-of-domain test sets. Notably, it
demonstrates superior generalization on public-domain data, surpassing methods
based on hand-crafted features, semantic embeddings, and end-to-end
architectures.

  There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that
leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While
early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared
to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical
due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can
approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver
efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,
which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples
trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled
using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a
learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables
efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator
gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation
rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and
speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality
of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other
first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark
control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot,
across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.

\\
  As organizations face increasing pressure to understand their corporate and
products' carbon footprints, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted calculation
systems for footprinting are proliferating, but with widely varying levels of
rigor and transparency. Standards and guidance have not kept pace with the
technology; evaluation datasets are nascent; and statistical approaches to
uncertainty analysis are not yet practical to apply to scaled systems. We
present a set of criteria to validate AI-assisted systems that calculate
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for products and materials. We implement a
three-step approach: (1) Identification of needs and constraints, (2) Draft
criteria development and (3) Refinements through pilots. The process identifies
three use cases of AI applications: Case 1 focuses on AI-assisted mapping to
existing datasets for corporate GHG accounting and product hotspotting,
automating repetitive manual tasks while maintaining mapping quality. Case 2
addresses AI systems that generate complete product models for corporate
decision-making, which require comprehensive validation of both component tasks
and end-to-end performance. We discuss the outlook for Case 3 applications,
systems that generate standards-compliant models. We find that credible AI
systems can be built and that they should be validated using system-level
evaluations rather than line-item review, with metrics such as benchmark
performance, indications of data quality and uncertainty, and transparent
documentation. This approach may be used as a foundation for practitioners,
auditors, and standards bodies to evaluate AI-assisted environmental assessment
tools. By establishing evaluation criteria that balance scalability with
credibility requirements, our approach contributes to the field's efforts to
develop appropriate standards for AI-assisted carbon footprinting systems.

  Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in
science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors
should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world
seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature
or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive
frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent
frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and
normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic
records from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku
and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory
signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging
hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic
settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental
strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate
that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a
pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake
forecasting.

Title: SABER: A SQL-Compatible Semantic Document Processing System Based on
  Extended Relational Algebra
Authors: Changjae Lee, Zhuoyue Zhao and Jinjun Xiong
Categories: cs.DB cs.AI
Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures
\\
  The emergence of large-language models (LLMs) has enabled a new class of
semantic data processing systems (SDPSs) to support declarative queries against
unstructured documents. Existing SDPSs are, however, lacking a unified
algebraic foundation, making their queries difficult to compose, reason, and
optimize. We propose a new semantic algebra, SABER (Semantic Algebra Based on
Extended Relational algebra), opening the possibility of semantic operations'
logical plan construction, optimization, and formal correctness guarantees. We
further propose to implement SABER in a SQL-compatible syntax so that it
natively supports mixed structured/unstructured data processing. With SABER, we
showcase the feasibility of providing a unified interface for existing SDPSs so
that it can effectively mix and match any semantically-compatible operator
implementation from any SDPS, greatly enhancing SABER's applicability for
community contributions.

  Satellite Communication (SatCom) networks represent a fundamental pillar in
modern global connectivity, facilitating reliable service and extensive
coverage across a plethora of applications. The expanding demand for
high-bandwidth services and the proliferation of mega satellite constellations
highlight the limitations of traditional exclusive satellite spectrum
allocation approaches. Cognitive Radio (CR) leading to Cognitive Satellite
(CogSat) networks through Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM), which enables the
dynamic adaptability of radio equipment to environmental conditions for optimal
performance, presents a promising solution for the emerging spectrum scarcity.
In this survey, we explore the adaptation of intelligent DSM methodologies to
SatCom, leveraging satellite network integrations. We discuss contributions and
hurdles in regulations and standardizations in realizing intelligent DSM in
SatCom, and deep dive into DSM techniques, which enable CogSat networks.
Furthermore, we extensively evaluate and categorize state-of-the-art Artificial
Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) methods leveraged for DSM while
exploring operational resilience and robustness of such integrations. In
addition, performance evaluation metrics critical for adaptive resource
management and system optimization in CogSat networks are thoroughly
investigated. This survey also identifies open challenges and outlines future
research directions in regulatory frameworks, network architectures, and
intelligent spectrum management, paving the way for sustainable and scalable
SatCom networks for enhanced global connectivity.

  We present the LLM ORDER BY operator as a logical abstraction and study its
physical implementations within a unified evaluation framework. Our experiments
show that no single approach is universally optimal, with effectiveness
depending on query characteristics and data. We introduce three new designs: an
agreement-based batch-size policy, a majority voting mechanism for pairwise
sorting, and a two-way external merge sort adapted for LLMs. With extensive
experiments, our agreement-based procedure is effective at determining batch
size for value-based methods, the majority-voting mechanism consistently
strengthens pairwise comparisons on GPT-4o, and external merge sort achieves
high accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across datasets and models. We further
observe a log-linear scaling between compute cost and ordering quality,
offering the first step toward principled cost models for LLM powered data
systems.

Title: TReF-6: Inferring Task-Relevant Frames from a Single Demonstration for
  One-Shot Skill Generalization
Authors: Yuxuan Ding, Shuangge Wang, Tesca Fitzgerald
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the
lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work,
we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF
Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an
influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a
local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement
Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure,
extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The
inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and
localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent
skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate
robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on
real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation
learning that preserves task intent across diverse object configurations.

Title: A Framework for Task and Motion Planning based on Expanding AND/OR
  Graphs
Authors: Fulvio Mastrogiovanni and Antony Thomas
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
Comments: Accepted for an oral presentation at ASTRA Conference, 2025
\\
  Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including
high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and
limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion
Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or
even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete
action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In
this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,
referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different
scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,
which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop
motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,
TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a
certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate
for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled
autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)
bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of
unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative
paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We
use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous
robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of
challenges in the benchmarks.

Title: Contact-Aided Navigation of Flexible Robotic Endoscope Using Deep
  Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Stomach
Authors: Chi Kit Ng, Huxin Gao, Tian-Ao Ren, Jiewen Lai, Hongliang Ren
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal
tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in
the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to
effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target
locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact
force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The
training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method
(FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success
rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and
significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach
environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average
error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios
with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based
CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior
methods.

Title: Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic
  Endoluminal Navigation of Deformable Continuum Robots
Authors: Yu Tian, Chi Kit Ng, Hongliang Ren
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to
nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the
Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While
Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators,
their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and
underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory
Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased
Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first
perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation
Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features
to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic
simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy
optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy
convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the
target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material
property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the
unseen tissue environment.

Title: Beyond Negative Transfer: Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion for
  Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation
Authors: Xiaoxin Ye, Chengkai Huang, Hongtao Huang, Lina Yao
Categories: cs.IR cs.AI
\\
  Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) leverages user behaviors across
domains to enhance recommendation quality. However, naive aggregation of
sequential signals can introduce conflicting domain-specific preferences,
leading to negative transfer. While Sequential Recommendation (SR) already
suffers from noisy behaviors such as misclicks and impulsive actions, CDSR
further amplifies this issue due to domain heterogeneity arising from diverse
item types and user intents. The core challenge is disentangling three
intertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences,
and noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework
well-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness
to noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making
them effective at capturing subtle preference signals. However, existing
applications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often
conflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain
collaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability
to model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose
\textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the
first diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge.
DPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This
disentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates
negative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.

Title: A Study on the Framework for Evaluating the Ethics and Trustworthiness
  of Generative AI

\\
  This study provides an in_depth analysis of the ethical and trustworthiness
challenges emerging alongside the rapid advancement of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies and proposes a comprehensive framework for their
systematic evaluation. While generative AI, such as ChatGPT, demonstrates
remarkable innovative potential, it simultaneously raises ethical and social
concerns, including bias, harmfulness, copyright infringement, privacy
violations, and hallucination. Current AI evaluation methodologies, which
mainly focus on performance and accuracy, are insufficient to address these
multifaceted issues. Thus, this study emphasizes the need for new
human_centered criteria that also reflect social impact. To this end, it
identifies key dimensions for evaluating the ethics and trustworthiness of
generative AI_fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, privacy,
accuracy, consistency, robustness, explainability, copyright and intellectual
property protection, and source traceability and develops detailed indicators
and assessment methodologies for each. Moreover, it provides a comparative
analysis of AI ethics policies and guidelines in South Korea, the United
States, the European Union, and China, deriving key approaches and implications
from each. The proposed framework applies across the AI lifecycle and
integrates technical assessments with multidisciplinary perspectives, thereby
offering practical means to identify and manage ethical risks in real_world
contexts. Ultimately, the study establishes an academic foundation for the
responsible advancement of generative AI and delivers actionable insights for
policymakers, developers, users, and other stakeholders, supporting the
positive societal contributions of AI technologies.

  This thesis introduces "Embodied Spatial Intelligence" to address the
challenge of creating robots that can perceive and act in the real world based
on natural language instructions. To bridge the gap between Large Language
Models (LLMs) and physical embodiment, we present contributions on two fronts:
scene representation and spatial reasoning. For perception, we develop robust,
scalable, and accurate scene representations using implicit neural models, with
contributions in self-supervised camera calibration, high-fidelity depth field
generation, and large-scale reconstruction. For spatial reasoning, we enhance
the spatial capabilities of LLMs by introducing a novel navigation benchmark, a
method for grounding language in 3D, and a state-feedback mechanism to improve
long-horizon decision-making. This work lays a foundation for robots that can
robustly perceive their surroundings and intelligently act upon complex,

  The escalating sophistication of malware necessitates robust detection
mechanisms that generalize across diverse data sources. Traditional
single-dataset models struggle with cross-domain generalization and often incur
high computational costs. This paper presents a novel, lightweight framework
for malware detection that employs probability-level fusion across three
distinct datasets: EMBER (static features), API Call Sequences (behavioral
features), and CIC Obfuscated Memory (memory patterns). Our method trains
individual LightGBM classifiers on each dataset, selects top predictive
features to ensure efficiency, and fuses their prediction probabilities using
optimized weights determined via grid search. Extensive experiments demonstrate

Title: A Novel Method to Determine Total Oxidant Concentration Produced by

  Accurate determination of total oxidant concentration ([Ox]_{tot}) in
non-thermal plasma (NTP)-treated aqueous systems remains a critical challenge
due to the transient nature of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and the
subjectivity of conventional titration methods used for [Ox]_{tot}
determination. This study introduces a novel, color-based computer analysis
(CBCA) method that integrates advanced image processing with machine learning
(ML) to quantify colorimetric shifts in potassium iodide (KI) solutions during
oxidation. First, a custom-built visual data acquisition system captured
high-resolution video of the color transitions in a KI solution during
oxidation with an NTP system. The change in [Ox]_{tot} during the experiments
was monitored with a standard titrimetric method. Second, the captured frames
were processed using a robust image processing pipeline to extract RGB, HSV,
and Lab color features. The extracted features were statistically evaluated,
and the results revealed strong linear correlations with the measured
[Ox]_{tot} values, particularly in the saturation (HSV), a and b (Lab), and
blue (RGB) channels. Subsequently, the [Ox]_{tot} measurements and the
extracted color features were used to train and validate five ML models. Among
them, linear regression and gradient boosting models achieved the highest
predictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.990). It was also found that reducing the feature
set from nine to four resulted in comparable performance with improved
prediction efficiency, especially for gradient boosting. Finally, comparison of
the model predictions with real titration measurements revealed that the CBCA
system successfully predicts the [Ox]_{tot} in KI solution with high accuracy
(R^2 > 0.998) even with a reduced number of features.

Title: NeuralSVCD for Efficient Swept Volume Collision Detection
Authors: Dongwon Son, Hojin Jung, Beomjoon Kim
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: CoRL 2025
\\
  Robot manipulation in unstructured environments requires efficient and
reliable Swept Volume Collision Detection (SVCD) for safe motion planning.
Traditional discrete methods potentially miss collisions between these points,
whereas SVCD continuously checks for collisions along the entire trajectory.
Existing SVCD methods typically face a trade-off between efficiency and
accuracy, limiting practical use. In this paper, we introduce NeuralSVCD, a
novel neural encoder-decoder architecture tailored to overcome this trade-off.
Our approach leverages shape locality and temporal locality through distributed
geometric representations and temporal optimization. This enhances
computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Comprehensive
experiments show that NeuralSVCD consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art SVCD methods in terms of both collision detection accuracy and
computational efficiency, demonstrating its robust applicability across diverse
robotic manipulation scenarios. Code and videos are available at

Title: LatentEdit: Adaptive Latent Control for Consistent Semantic Editing
Authors: Siyi Liu, Weiming Chen, Yushun Tang, Zhihai He
Categories: cs.GR cs.AI cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by PRCV 2025
\\
  Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent
years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing
while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory
efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion
framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference
latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source
features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating
target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables
fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal
model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight,
plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based
architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that
our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and
editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps.
Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural
function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate
variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.

Title: Can AI be Auditable?
Authors: Himanshu Verma, Kirtan Path, Eva Thelisson
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.HC
\\
  Auditability is defined as the capacity of AI systems to be independently
assessed for compliance with ethical, legal, and technical standards throughout
their lifecycle. The chapter explores how auditability is being formalized
through emerging regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, which mandate
documentation, risk assessments, and governance structures. It analyzes the
diverse challenges facing AI auditability, including technical opacity,
inconsistent documentation practices, lack of standardized audit tools and
metrics, and conflicting principles within existing responsible AI frameworks.
The discussion highlights the need for clear guidelines, harmonized
international regulations, and robust socio-technical methodologies to
operationalize auditability at scale. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the
importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration and auditor empowerment in
building an effective AI audit ecosystem. It argues that auditability must be
embedded in AI development practices and governance infrastructures to ensure
that AI systems are not only functional but also ethically and legally aligned.

Title: KVComp: A High-Performance, LLM-Aware, Lossy Compression Framework for
  KV Cache
Authors: Bo Jiang, Taolue Yang, Youyuan Liu, Chengming Zhang, Xubin He, Sian

Categories: cs.DC cs.AI
\\
  Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive
potential in various practical applications. However, long context inference
poses a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the
key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to multiple gigabytes as sequence length
and batch size increase. In this paper, we present KVComp, a generic and
efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-text generation that
synergistically works with both latency-critical and throughput-critical
inference systems. KVComp employs novel lossy compression techniques
specifically designed for KV cache data characteristics, featuring careful
co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach
maintains compatibility with the growing nature of KV cache while preserving
high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that KVComp achieves
on average 47\% and up to 83\% higher memory reduction rate compared to
existing methods with little/no model accuracy degradation. Furthermore, KVComp
achieves extremely high execution throughput, effectively reducing
decompression overhead and, in some cases, even accelerating the matrix-vector
multiplication operation and outperform cuBLAS-based attention kernels with
less data movement.

\\
  We investigate how to calculate Kaplan-Meier survival curves across multiple
health-care jurisdictions while protecting patient privacy with node-level
differential privacy. Each site discloses its curve only once, adding Laplace
noise whose scale is determined by the length of the common time grid; the
server then averages the noisy curves, so the overall privacy budget remains
unchanged. We benchmark four one-shot smoothing techniques: Discrete Cosine
Transform, Haar Wavelet shrinkage, adaptive Total-Variation denoising, and a
parametric Weibull fit on the NCCTG lung-cancer cohort under five privacy
levels and three partition scenarios (uniform, moderately skewed, highly
imbalanced). Total-Variation gives the best mean accuracy, whereas the
frequency-domain smoothers offer stronger worst-case robustness and the Weibull
model shows the most stable behaviour at the strictest privacy setting. Across
all methods the released curves keep the empirical log-rank type-I error below
fifteen percent for privacy budgets of 0.5 and higher, demonstrating that
clinically useful survival information can be shared without iterative training
or heavy cryptography.

Title: Enabling Trustworthy Federated Learning via Remote Attestation for
  Mitigating Byzantine Threats
Authors: Chaoyu Zhang and Heng Jin and Shanghao Shi and Hexuan Yu and Sydney
  Johns and Y. Thomas Hou and Wenjing Lou
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention for its
privacy-preserving capabilities, enabling distributed devices to
collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, its
distributed nature forces the central server to blindly trust the local
training process and aggregate uncertain model updates, making it susceptible
to Byzantine attacks from malicious participants, especially in
mission-critical scenarios. Detecting such attacks is challenging due to the
diverse knowledge across clients, where variations in model updates may stem
from benign factors, such as non-IID data, rather than adversarial behavior.
Existing data-driven defenses struggle to distinguish malicious updates from
natural variations, leading to high false positive rates and poor filtering
performance.
  To address this challenge, we propose Sentinel, a remote attestation
(RA)-based scheme for FL systems that regains client-side transparency and
mitigates Byzantine attacks from a system security perspective. Our system
employs code instrumentation to track control-flow and monitor critical
variables in the local training process. Additionally, we utilize a trusted
training recorder within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to generate an
attestation report, which is cryptographically signed and securely transmitted
to the server. Upon verification, the server ensures that legitimate client
training processes remain free from program behavior violation or data
manipulation, allowing only trusted model updates to be aggregated into the
global model. Experimental results on IoT devices demonstrate that Sentinel
ensures the trustworthiness of the local training integrity with low runtime
and memory overhead.

\\
  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful and
widely used tools for molecular structure elucidation in organic chemistry.
However, the interpretation of NMR spectra to determine unknown molecular
structures remains a labor-intensive and expertise-dependent process,
particularly for complex or novel compounds. Although recent methods have been
proposed for molecular structure elucidation, they often underperform in
real-world applications due to inherent algorithmic limitations and limited
high-quality data. Here, we present NMR-Solver, a practical and interpretable
framework for the automated determination of small organic molecule structures
from $^1$H and $^{13}$C NMR spectra. Our method introduces an automated
framework for molecular structure elucidation, integrating large-scale spectral
matching with physics-guided fragment-based optimization that exploits
atomic-level structure-spectrum relationships in NMR. We evaluate NMR-Solver on
simulated benchmarks, curated experimental data from the literature, and
real-world experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization, robustness,
and practical utility in challenging, real-life scenarios. NMR-Solver unifies
computational NMR analysis, deep learning, and interpretable chemical reasoning
into a coherent system. By incorporating the physical principles of NMR into
molecular optimization, it enables scalable, automated, and chemically
meaningful molecular identification, establishing a generalizable paradigm for
solving inverse problems in molecular science.

  The rapid digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)
systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially for older
workers. With growing emphasis on STEM skills such as robotics, automation,
artificial intelligence (AI), and security, large-scale re-skilling and
up-skilling are required. Training programs must address diverse backgrounds,
learning styles, and motivations to improve persistence and success, while
ensuring rapid, cost-effective workforce development through experiential
learning. To meet these challenges, we present an adaptive tutoring framework
that combines generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
deliver personalized training. The framework leverages document hit rate and
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to optimize content for each learner, and is
benchmarked against human-generated training for alignment and relevance. We
demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic
QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated
cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with
manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses
are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4,
assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best
performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode
approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic
recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid,
tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development.

  The rapid growth of hardware vulnerabilities has created an urgent need for
systematic and scalable analysis methods. Unlike software flaws, which are
often patchable post-deployment, hardware weaknesses remain embedded across
product lifecycles, posing persistent risks to processors, embedded devices,
and IoT platforms. Existing efforts such as the MITRE CWE Hardware List (2021)
relied on expert-driven Delphi surveys, which lack statistical rigor and
introduce subjective bias, while large-scale data-driven foundations for
hardware weaknesses have been largely absent. In this work, we propose
LLM-HyPZ, an LLM-assisted hybrid framework for zero-shot knowledge extraction
and refinement from vulnerability corpora. Our approach integrates zero-shot
LLM classification, contextualized embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and
prompt-driven summarization to mine hardware-related CVEs at scale. Applying
LLM-HyPZ to the 2021-2024 CVE corpus (114,836 entries), we identified 1,742
hardware-related vulnerabilities. We distilled them into five recurring themes,
including privilege escalation via firmware and BIOS, memory corruption in
mobile and IoT systems, and physical access exploits. Benchmarking across seven
LLMs shows that LLaMA 3.3 70B achieves near-perfect classification accuracy
(99.5%) on a curated validation set. Beyond methodological contributions, our
framework directly supported the MITRE CWE Most Important Hardware Weaknesses
(MIHW) 2025 update by narrowing the candidate search space. Specifically, our
pipeline surfaced 411 of the 1,026 CVEs used for downstream MIHW analysis,
thereby reducing expert workload and accelerating evidence gathering. These
results establish LLM-HyPZ as the first data-driven, scalable approach for
systematically discovering hardware vulnerabilities, thereby bridging the gap
between expert knowledge and real-world vulnerability evidence.

Title: The Name-Free Gap: Policy-Aware Stylistic Control in Music Generation
Authors: Ashwin Nagarajan, Hao-Wen Dong
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI cs.LG cs.MM eess.AS
Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Text-to-music models capture broad attributes such as instrumentation or
mood, but fine-grained stylistic control remains an open challenge. Existing
stylization methods typically require retraining or specialized conditioning,
which complicates reproducibility and limits policy compliance when artist
names are restricted. We study whether lightweight, human-readable modifiers
sampled from a large language model can provide a policy-robust alternative for
stylistic control. Using MusicGen-small, we evaluate two artists: Billie Eilish
(vocal pop) and Ludovico Einaudi (instrumental piano). For each artist, we use
fifteen reference excerpts and evaluate matched seeds under three conditions:
baseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and five descriptor sets. All prompts
are generated using a large language model. Evaluation uses both VGGish and
CLAP embeddings with distributional and per-clip similarity measures, including
a new min-distance attribution metric. Results show that artist names are the
strongest control signal across both artists, while name-free descriptors
recover much of this effect. This highlights that existing safeguards such as
the restriction of artist names in music generation prompts may not fully
prevent style imitation. Cross-artist transfers reduce alignment, showing that
descriptors encode targeted stylistic cues. We also present a descriptor table
across ten contemporary artists to illustrate the breadth of the tokens.
Together these findings define the name-free gap, the controllability
difference between artist-name prompts and policy-compliant descriptors, shown
through a reproducible evaluation protocol for prompt-level controllability.

Title: Queuing for Civility: Regulating Emotions and Reducing Toxicity in
  Digital Discourse
Authors: Akriti Verma, Shama Islam, Valeh Moghaddam and Adnan Anwar
Categories: cs.HC cs.AI cs.CY cs.LG cs.SI
\\
  The pervasiveness of online toxicity, including hate speech and trolling,
disrupts digital interactions and online well-being. Previous research has
mainly focused on post-hoc moderation, overlooking the real-time emotional
dynamics of online conversations and the impact of users' emotions on others.
This paper presents a graph-based framework to identify the need for emotion
regulation within online conversations. This framework promotes self-reflection
to manage emotional responses and encourage responsible behaviour in real time.
Additionally, a comment queuing mechanism is proposed to address intentional
trolls who exploit emotions to inflame conversations. This mechanism introduces
a delay in publishing comments, giving users time to self-regulate before
further engaging in the conversation and helping maintain emotional balance.
Analysis of social media data from Twitter and Reddit demonstrates that the
graph-based framework reduced toxicity by 12%, while the comment queuing
mechanism decreased the spread of anger by 15%, with only 4% of comments being
temporarily held on average. These findings indicate that combining real-time
emotion regulation with delayed moderation can significantly improve well-being
in online environments.

Title: Unsupervised Dataset Cleaning Framework for Encrypted Traffic
  Classification
Authors: Kun Qiu, Ying Wang, Baoqian Li, Wenjun Zhu
Categories: cs.NI cs.AI
Comments: Accepted in IEEE ICNP 2025 Poster
\\
  Traffic classification, a technique for assigning network flows to predefined
categories, has been widely deployed in enterprise and carrier networks. With
the massive adoption of mobile devices, encryption is increasingly used in
mobile applications to address privacy concerns. Consequently, traditional
methods such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) fail to distinguish encrypted
traffic. To tackle this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular
Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a promising solution for encrypted
traffic classification. A crucial prerequisite for any ML-based approach is
traffic data cleaning, which removes flows that are not useful for training
(e.g., irrelevant protocols, background activity, control-plane messages, and
long-lived sessions). Existing cleaning solutions depend on manual inspection
of every captured packet, making the process both costly and time-consuming. In
this poster, we present an unsupervised framework that automatically cleans
encrypted mobile traffic. Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our
framework incurs only a 2%~2.5% reduction in classification accuracy compared
with manual cleaning. These results demonstrate that our method offers an
efficient and effective preprocessing step for ML-based encrypted traffic
classification.

  Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) promises compact function approximators
with access to vast Hilbert spaces, but its practical progress is slowed by
NISQ-era constraints such as limited qubits and noise accumulation. We
introduce a multi-chip ensemble framework using multiple small Quantum
Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) to overcome these constraints. Our
approach partitions complex, high-dimensional observations from the Super Mario
Bros environment across independent quantum circuits, then classically
aggregates their outputs within a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) framework. This
modular architecture enables QRL in complex environments previously
inaccessible to quantum agents, achieving superior performance and learning
stability compared to classical baselines and single-chip quantum models. The
multi-chip ensemble demonstrates enhanced scalability by reducing information
loss from dimensionality reduction while remaining implementable on near-term
quantum hardware, providing a practical pathway for applying QRL to real-world
problems.

The ERI aggregates six signals -- Mastery (M), Coverage (C), Retention (R),
Pace (P), Volatility (V), and Endurance (E) -- each derived from a stream of
practice and mock-test interactions. We formalize axioms for component maps and
the composite, prove monotonicity, Lipschitz stability, and bounded drift under
blueprint re-weighting, and show existence and uniqueness of the optimal linear
composite under convex design constraints. We further characterize confidence
bands via blueprint-weighted concentration and prove compatibility with
prerequisite-admissible curricula (knowledge spaces / learning spaces). The
paper focuses on theory; empirical study is left to future work.

Title: Quantum Causality: Resolving Simpson's Paradox with
  $\mathcal{DO}$-Calculus
Authors: Pilsung Kang
Categories: quant-ph cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Distinguishing correlation from causation is a fundamental challenge in
machine intelligence, often representing a critical barrier to building robust
and trustworthy systems. While Pearl's $\mathcal{DO}$-calculus provides a
rigorous framework for causal inference, a parallel challenge lies in its
physical implementation. Here, we apply and experimentally validate a quantum
algorithmic framework for performing causal interventions. Our approach maps
causal networks onto quantum circuits where probabilistic links are encoded by
controlled-rotation gates, and interventions are realized by a structural
remodeling of the circuit -- a physical analogue to Pearl's ``graph surgery''.
We demonstrate the method's efficacy by resolving Simpson's Paradox in a
3-qubit model, and show its scalability by quantifying confounding bias in a
10-qubit healthcare simulation. Critically, we provide a proof-of-principle
experimental validation on an IonQ Aria quantum computer, successfully
reproducing the paradox and its resolution in the presence of real-world noise.
This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum causal inference,
offering a new computational tool to address deep-rooted challenges in
algorithmic fairness and explainable AI (XAI).

Journal-ref: 29th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test, 2025
\\
  This paper proposes an low power approximate multiplier architecture for deep
neural network (DNN) applications. A 4:2 compressor, introducing only a single
combination error, is designed and integrated into an 8x8 unsigned multiplier.
This integration significantly reduces the usage of exact compressors while
preserving low error rates. The proposed multiplier is employed within a custom
convolution layer and evaluated on neural network tasks, including image
recognition and denoising. Hardware evaluation demonstrates that the proposed
design achieves up to 30.24% energy savings compared to the best among existing
multipliers. In image denoising, the custom approximate convolution layer
achieves improved Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) compared to other approximate designs. Additionally, when
applied to handwritten digit recognition, the model maintains high
classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed
architecture offers a favorable balance between energy efficiency and
computational precision, making it suitable for low-power AI hardware
implementations.

\\
  Recent advances in text-to-music (TTM) generation have enabled controllable
and expressive music creation using natural language prompts. However, the
emotional fidelity of TTM systems remains largely underexplored compared to
human preference or text alignment. In this study, we introduce AImoclips, a
benchmark for evaluating how well TTM systems convey intended emotions to human
listeners, covering both open-source and commercial models. We selected 12
emotion intents spanning four quadrants of the valence-arousal space, and used
six state-of-the-art TTM systems to generate over 1,000 music clips. A total of
111 participants rated the perceived valence and arousal of each clip on a
9-point Likert scale. Our results show that commercial systems tend to produce
music perceived as more pleasant than intended, while open-source systems tend
to perform the opposite. Emotions are more accurately conveyed under
high-arousal conditions across all models. Additionally, all systems exhibit a
bias toward emotional neutrality, highlighting a key limitation in affective
controllability. This benchmark offers valuable insights into model-specific

Title: Adaptive Vehicle Speed Classification via BMCNN with Reinforcement
  Learning-Enhanced Acoustic Processing

\\
  Traffic congestion remains a pressing urban challenge, requiring intelligent
transportation systems for real-time management. We present a hybrid framework
that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning for acoustic vehicle
speed classification. A dual-branch BMCNN processes MFCC and wavelet features
to capture complementary frequency patterns. An attention-enhanced DQN
adaptively selects the minimal number of audio frames and triggers early
decisions once confidence thresholds are reached. Evaluations on IDMT-Traffic
and our SZUR-Acoustic (Suzhou) datasets show 95.99% and 92.3% accuracy, with up
to 1.63x faster average processing via early termination. Compared with A3C,
DDDQN, SA2C, PPO, and TD3, the method provides a superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-off and is suitable for real-time ITS deployment in heterogeneous urban
environments.

  Students routinely use ChatGPT and the like now to help them with their
homework, such as writing an essay. It takes less effort to complete and is
easier to do than by hand. It can even produce as good if not better output
than the student's own work. However, there is a growing concern that
over-reliance on using GenAI in this way will stifle the development of
learning writing and critical thinking skills. How might this trend be
reversed? What if students were required to make more effort when using GenAI
to do their homework? It might be more challenging, but the additional effort
involved could result in them learning more and having a greater sense of
achievement. This tension can be viewed as a form of effort paradox; where
effort is both viewed as something to be avoided but at the same time is
valued. Is it possible to let students learn sometimes with less and other
times more effort? Students are already adept at the former but what about the
latter? Could we design new kinds of AI tools that deliberately require more
effort to use to deepen the learning experience? In this paper, I begin to
outline what form these might take, for example, asking students to use a
combination of GenAI tools with traditional learning approaches (e.g.
note-taking while reading). I also discuss how else to design tools to think
with that augments human cognition; where students learn more the skills of
metacognition and reflection.

Title: Speech Command Recognition Using LogNNet Reservoir Computing for
  Embedded Systems
Authors: Yuriy Izotov and Andrei Velichko
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI cs.LG eess.AS
Comments: 20 pages, 6 figures
\\
  This paper presents a low-resource speech-command recognizer combining
energy-based voice activity detection (VAD), an optimized Mel-Frequency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) pipeline, and the LogNNet reservoir-computing
classifier. Using four commands from the Speech Commands da-taset downsampled
to 8 kHz, we evaluate four MFCC aggregation schemes and find that adaptive
binning (64-dimensional feature vector) offers the best accuracy-to-compactness
trade-off. The LogNNet classifier with architecture 64:33:9:4 reaches 92.04%
accuracy under speaker-independent evaluation, while requiring significantly
fewer parameters than conventional deep learn-ing models. Hardware
implementation on Arduino Nano 33 IoT (ARM Cor-tex-M0+, 48 MHz, 32 KB RAM)
validates the practical feasibility, achieving ~90% real-time recognition
accuracy while consuming only 18 KB RAM (55% utilization). The complete
pipeline (VAD -> MFCC -> LogNNet) thus enables reliable on-device
speech-command recognition under strict memory and compute limits, making it
suitable for battery-powered IoT nodes, wire-less sensor networks, and
hands-free control interfaces.

Title: Can General-Purpose Omnimodels Compete with Specialists? A Case Study in
  Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Yizhe Zhang, Qiang Chen, Tao Zhou
Categories: eess.IV cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 15 pages, 7 figures
\\
  The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing
diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these
``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in
knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the
high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study
analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5
Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on
three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast
tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the
extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on
the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and
task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist
models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness
on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the
fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model
maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly,
qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity,
identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results
indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for
specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with
specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge
cases.

Title: Accelerating Latency-Critical Applications with AI-Powered
  Semi-Automatic Fine-Grained Parallelization on SMT Processors

\\
  Latency-critical applications tend to show low utilization of functional
units due to frequent cache misses and mispredictions during speculative
execution in high-performance superscalar processors. However, due to
significant impact on single-thread performance, Simultaneous Multithreading
(SMT) technology is rarely used with heavy threads of latency-critical
applications. In this paper, we explore utilization of SMT technology to
support fine-grained parallelization of latency-critical applications.
Following the advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs),
we introduce Aira, an AI-powered Parallelization Adviser. To implement Aira, we
extend AI Coding Agent in Cursor IDE with additional tools connected through
Model Context Protocol, enabling end-to-end AI Agent for parallelization.
Additional connected tools enable LLM-guided hotspot detection, collection of
dynamic dependencies with Dynamic Binary Instrumentation, SMT-aware performance
simulation to estimate performance gains. We apply Aira with Relic parallel
framework for fine-grained task parallelism on SMT cores to parallelize
latency-critical benchmarks representing real-world applications used in
industry. We show 17% geomean performance gain from parallelization of
latency-critical benchmarks using Aira with Relic framework.

\\
  The success of the generative model has gained unprecedented attention in the
music generation area. Transformer-based architectures have set new benchmarks
for model performance. However, their practical adoption is hindered by some
critical challenges: the demand for massive computational resources and
inference time, due to their large number of parameters. These obstacles make
them infeasible to deploy on edge devices, such as smartphones and wearables,
with limited computational resources. In this work, we present TinyMusician, a
lightweight music generation model distilled from MusicGen (a State-of-the-art
music generation model). TinyMusician integrates two innovations: (i)
Stage-mixed Bidirectional and Skewed KL-Divergence and (ii) Adaptive
Mixed-Precision Quantization. The experimental results demonstrate that
TinyMusician retains 93% of the MusicGen-Small performance with 55% less model
size. TinyMusician is the first mobile-deployable music generation model that
eliminates cloud dependency while maintaining high audio fidelity and efficient
resource usage

Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for accessibility
guidance, yet many disability groups remain underserved by their advice. To
address this gap, we present taxonomy aligned benchmark1 of human validated,
general purpose accessibility questions, designed to systematically audit
inclusivity across disabilities. Our benchmark evaluates models along three
dimensions: Question-Level Coverage (breadth within answers), Disability-Level
Coverage (balance across nine disability categories), and Depth (specificity of
support). Applying this framework to 17 proprietary and open-weight models
reveals persistent inclusivity gaps: Vision, Hearing, and Mobility are
frequently addressed, while Speech, Genetic/Developmental, Sensory-Cognitive,
and Mental Health remain under served. Depth is similarly concentrated in a few
categories but sparse elsewhere. These findings reveal who gets left behind in
current LLM accessibility guidance and highlight actionable levers:
taxonomy-aware prompting/training and evaluations that jointly audit breadth,
balance, and depth.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical
systems, facilitating tasks such as satellite operations, command-and-control,
military decision support, and cyber defense. Many of these systems are
accessed through application programming interfaces (APIs). When such APIs lack
robust access controls, they can expose full or top-k logits, creating a
significant and often overlooked attack surface. Prior art has mainly focused
on reconstructing the output projection layer or distilling surface-level
behaviors. However, regenerating a black-box model under tight query
constraints remains underexplored. We address that gap by introducing a
constrained replication pipeline that transforms partial logit leakage into a
functional deployable substitute model clone. Our two-stage approach (i)
reconstructs the output projection matrix by collecting top-k logits from under
10k black-box queries via singular value decomposition (SVD) over the logits,
then (ii) distills the remaining architecture into compact student models with
varying transformer depths, trained on an open source dataset. A 6-layer
student recreates 97.6% of the 6-layer teacher model's hidden-state geometry,
with only a 7.31% perplexity increase, and a 7.58 Negative Log-Likelihood
(NLL). A 4-layer variant achieves 17.1% faster inference and 18.1% parameter
reduction with comparable performance. The entire attack completes in under 24
graphics processing unit (GPU) hours and avoids triggering API rate-limit
defenses. These results demonstrate how quickly a cost-limited adversary can
clone an LLM, underscoring the urgent need for hardened inference APIs and
secure on-premise defense deployments.

Title: Q-Learning--Driven Adaptive Rewiring for Cooperative Control in
  Heterogeneous Networks
Authors: Yi-Ning Weng and Hsuan-Wei Lee
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.AI
Comments: 40 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Cooperation emergence in multi-agent systems represents a fundamental
statistical physics problem where microscopic learning rules drive macroscopic
collective behavior transitions. We propose a Q-learning-based variant of
adaptive rewiring that builds on mechanisms studied in the literature. This
method combines temporal difference learning with network restructuring so that
agents can optimize strategies and social connections based on interaction
histories. Through neighbor-specific Q-learning, agents develop sophisticated
partnership management strategies that enable cooperator cluster formation,
creating spatial separation between cooperative and defective regions. Using
power-law networks that reflect real-world heterogeneous connectivity patterns,
we evaluate emergent behaviors under varying rewiring constraint levels,
revealing distinct cooperation patterns across parameter space rather than
sharp thermodynamic transitions. Our systematic analysis identifies three
behavioral regimes: a permissive regime (low constraints) enabling rapid
cooperative cluster formation, an intermediate regime with sensitive dependence
on dilemma strength, and a patient regime (high constraints) where strategic
accumulation gradually optimizes network structure. Simulation results show
that while moderate constraints create transition-like zones that suppress
cooperation, fully adaptive rewiring enhances cooperation levels through
systematic exploration of favorable network configurations. Quantitative
analysis reveals that increased rewiring frequency drives large-scale cluster
formation with power-law size distributions. Our results establish a new
paradigm for understanding intelligence-driven cooperation pattern formation in
complex adaptive systems, revealing how machine learning serves as an
alternative driving force for spontaneous organization in multi-agent networks.

Title: DRetNet: A Novel Deep Learning Framework for Diabetic Retinopathy
  Diagnosis

Comments: 12 pages
\\
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide,
necessitating early detection to prevent vision loss. Current automated DR
detection systems often struggle with poor-quality images, lack
interpretability, and insufficient integration of domain-specific knowledge. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that integrates three
innovative contributions: (1) Adaptive Retinal Image Enhancement Using
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): this technique dynamically enhances
retinal images by incorporating physical constraints, improving the visibility
of critical features such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates; (2)
Hybrid Feature Fusion Network (HFFN): by combining deep learning embeddings
with handcrafted features, HFFN leverages both learned representations and
domain-specific knowledge to enhance generalization and accuracy; (3)
Multi-Stage Classifier with Uncertainty Quantification: this method breaks down
the classification process into logical stages, providing interpretable
predictions and confidence scores, thereby improving clinical trust. The
proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 92.7%, a precision of 92.5%, a
recall of 92.6%, an F1-score of 92.5%, an AUC of 97.8%, a mAP of 0.96, and an
MCC of 0.85. Ophthalmologists rated the framework's predictions as highly
clinically relevant (4.8/5), highlighting its alignment with real-world
diagnostic needs. Qualitative analyses, including Grad-CAM visualizations and
uncertainty heatmaps, further enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness
of the system. The framework demonstrates robust performance across diverse
conditions, including low-quality images, noisy data, and unseen datasets.
These features make the proposed framework a promising tool for clinical
adoption, enabling more accurate and reliable DR detection in resource-limited
settings.

  Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference, but its
reliance on a fixed speculation length is suboptimal in large-batch serving
environments with diverse requests. This paper explores a new direction for
dynamic adaptation by investigating a novel class of post-hoc, diagnostic
signals. We propose Dynamic Speculative Decoding Engine (DSDE), a training-free
framework built on two primary components: (1) a predictive signal based on the
variance of the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, which diagnoses the
generation's regional stability, and (2) an adaptive speculation length cap to
mitigate the straggler problem in per-sequence decoding. Experiments
demonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic
adaptation. An algorithm guided by these signals achieves end-to-end latency
competitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across
diverse workloads. This robustness is particularly valuable in challenging
low-acceptance-rate regimes, where the proposed signal maintains its diagnostic
utility. Collectively, these findings validate post-hoc signals as a valuable
component for building more robust and intelligent LLM inference systems, and
highlight a promising direction for future research on dynamic speculation
length adaptation.

  Auscultation is a key method for early diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary
diseases, relying on skilled healthcare professionals. However, the process is
often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep
learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which
focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory
sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods
typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to
generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn
directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, lim-
iting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally,
the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance
has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph
neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling
variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for
abnormal respi- ratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility
and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound
2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the proposed
approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the
discrimination between abnormal sounds.

Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.MA
\\
  With the proliferation of applications built upon LLM-driven multi-agent
systems (MAS), the security of Web links has become a critical concern in
ensuring system reliability. Once an agent is induced to visit a malicious
website, attackers can use it as a springboard to conduct diverse subsequent
attacks, which will drastically expand the attack surface. In this paper, we
propose Web Fraud Attacks, a novel type of attack aiming at inducing MAS to
visit malicious websites. We design 11 representative attack variants that
encompass domain name tampering (homoglyph deception, character substitution,
etc.), link structure camouflage (sub-directory nesting, sub-domain grafting,
parameter obfuscation, etc.), and other deceptive techniques tailored to
exploit MAS's vulnerabilities in link validation. Through extensive experiments
on these crafted attack vectors, we demonstrate that Web fraud attacks not only
exhibit significant destructive potential across different MAS architectures
but also possess a distinct advantage in evasion: they circumvent the need for
complex input formats such as jailbreaking, which inherently carry higher
exposure risks. These results underscore the importance of addressing Web fraud
attacks in LLM-driven MAS, as their stealthiness and destructiveness pose
non-negligible threats to system security and user safety.

  Quantization is a critical technique for accelerating LLM inference by
reducing memory footprint and improving computational efficiency. Among various
schemes, 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation quantization (W4A8) offers a strong
balance between accuracy and performance. However, existing W4A8 GEMM kernels
fall short in practice due to inefficient dequantization on CUDA Cores, which
cannot keep pace with the high throughput of Tensor Cores. In this paper, we
present LiquidGEMM, a hardware-efficient W4A8 GEMM kernel for efficient LLM
serving. LiquidGEMM designs two key techniques: LiquidQuant, a
hardware-efficient quantization method that enables fast, overflow-safe
dequantization using just two arithmetic instructions per four elements; and an
implicit fine-grained pipeline that fully overlaps weight loading,
dequantization, and MMA across warp groups without software synchronization or
redundant memory traffic. Experimental results show that LiquidGEMM achieves up
to 2.90x speedup over state-of-the-art W4A8 kernels and up to 4.94x end-to-end
system-level speedup. Compared to various quantized GEMM kernels in NVIDIA
TensorRT-LLM, LiquidGEMM delivers 1.12-1.63x performance gains, and achieves up
to 1.63x system-level speedup.

  In a context where the social sciences and humanities are experimenting with
non-anthropocentric analytical frames, this article proposes a semiotic
(structural) reading of the hybridization between symbolic AI and neural (or
sub-symbolic) AI based on a field of application: the design and use of a
knowledge base for area studies. We describe the LaCAS ecosystem -- Open
Archives in Linguistic and Cultural Studies (thesaurus; RDF/OWL ontology; LOD
services; harvesting; expertise; publication), deployed at Inalco (National
Institute for Oriental Languages and Civilizations) in Paris with the Okapi
(Open Knowledge and Annotation Interface) software environment from Ina
(National Audiovisual Institute), which now has around 160,000 documentary
resources and ten knowledge macro-domains grouping together several thousand
knowledge objects. We illustrate this approach using the knowledge domain
''Languages of the world'' (~540 languages) and the knowledge object ''Quechua
(language)''. On this basis, we discuss the controlled integration of neural
tools, more specifically generative tools, into the life cycle of a knowledge
base: assistance with data localization/qualification, index extraction and
aggregation, property suggestion and testing, dynamic file generation, and
engineering of contextualized prompts (generic, contextual, explanatory,
adjustment, procedural) aligned with a domain ontology. We outline an ecosystem
of specialized agents capable of animating the database while respecting its
symbolic constraints, by articulating model-driven and data-driven methods.

  Nowadays, the volume of network traffic continues to grow, along with the
frequency and sophistication of attacks. This scenario highlights the need for
solutions capable of continuously adapting, since network behavior is dynamic
and changes over time. This work presents an anomaly detection model for
network flows using unsupervised machine learning with online learning
capabilities. This approach allows the system to dynamically learn the normal
behavior of the network and detect deviations without requiring labeled data,
which is particularly useful in real-world environments where traffic is
constantly changing and labeled data is scarce. The model was implemented using
the River library with a One-Class SVM and evaluated on the NF-UNSW-NB15
dataset and its extended version v2, which contain network flows labeled with
different attack categories. The results show an accuracy above 98%, a false

the dataset. In addition, the low processing time per flow (<0.033 ms)

  Magnetic levitation is poised to revolutionize industrial automation by
integrating flexible in-machine product transport and seamless manipulation. It
is expected to become the standard drive for automated manufacturing. However,
controlling such systems is inherently challenging due to their complex,
unstable dynamics. Traditional control approaches, which rely on hand-crafted
control engineering, typically yield robust but conservative solutions, with
their performance closely tied to the expertise of the engineering team. In
contrast, neural control learning presents a promising alternative. This paper
presents the first neural controller for 6D magnetic levitation. Trained
end-to-end on interaction data from a proprietary controller, it directly maps
raw sensor data and 6D reference poses to coil current commands. The neural
controller can effectively generalize to previously unseen situations while
maintaining accurate and robust control. These results underscore the practical
feasibility of learning-based neural control in complex physical systems and
suggest a future where such a paradigm could enhance or even substitute
traditional engineering approaches in demanding real-world applications. The
trained neural controller, source code, and demonstration videos are publicly

  Separating overlapping speech from multiple speakers is crucial for effective
human-vehicle interaction. This paper proposes CabinSep, a lightweight neural
mask-based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) speech separation
approach, to reduce speech recognition errors in back-end automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models. Our contributions are threefold: First, we utilize
channel information to extract spatial features, which improves the estimation
of speech and noise masks. Second, we employ MVDR during inference, reducing
speech distortion to make it more ASR-friendly. Third, we introduce a data
augmentation method combining simulated and real-recorded impulse responses
(IRs), improving speaker localization at zone boundaries and further reducing
speech recognition errors. With a computational complexity of only 0.4 GMACs,
CabinSep achieves a 17.5% relative reduction in speech recognition error rate
in a real-recorded dataset compared to the state-of-the-art DualSep model.

Title: DCA: Graph-Guided Deep Embedding Clustering for Brain Atlases
Authors: Mo Wang, Kaining Peng, Jingsheng Tang, Hongkai Wen, Quanying Liu
Categories: q-bio.NC cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging
data and enabling interpretable analysis. However, most existing atlases are
predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We
present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering
framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA
combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to
produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method
supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes
to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking
platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across
multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases,
improving functional homogeneity by 98.8\% and silhouette coefficient by 29\%,
and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as autism diagnosis
and cognitive decoding. Codes and models will be released soon.

Comments: Under Review
\\
  Community detection in graphs is crucial for understanding the organization
of nodes into densely connected clusters. While numerous strategies have been
developed to identify these clusters, the success of community detection can
lead to privacy and information security concerns, as individuals may not want
their personal information exposed. To address this, community deception
methods have been proposed to reduce the effectiveness of detection algorithms.
Nevertheless, several limitations, such as the rationality of evaluation
metrics and the unnoticeability of attacks, have been ignored in current
deception methods. Therefore, in this work, we first investigate the
limitations of the widely used deception metric, i.e., the decrease of
modularity, through empirical studies. Then, we propose a new deception metric,
and combine this new metric together with the attack budget to model the
unnoticeable community deception task as a multi-objective optimization
problem. To further improve the deception performance, we propose two variant
methods by incorporating the degree-biased and community-biased candidate node
selection mechanisms. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed community deception strategies.

Title: An Information-Flow Perspective on Explainability Requirements:
  Specification and Verification
Authors: Bernd Finkbeiner, Hadar Frenkel, Julian Siber
Categories: cs.LO cs.AI
Comments: 22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge
  Representation and Reasoning (KR 2025)
\\
  Explainable systems expose information about why certain observed effects are
happening to the agents interacting with them. We argue that this constitutes a
positive flow of information that needs to be specified, verified, and balanced
against negative information flow that may, e.g., violate privacy guarantees.
Since both explainability and privacy require reasoning about knowledge, we
tackle these tasks with epistemic temporal logic extended with quantification
over counterfactual causes. This allows us to specify that a multi-agent system
exposes enough information such that agents acquire knowledge on why some
effect occurred. We show how this principle can be used to specify
explainability as a system-level requirement and provide an algorithm for
checking finite-state models against such specifications. We present a
prototype implementation of the algorithm and evaluate it on several
benchmarks, illustrating how our approach distinguishes between explainable and
unexplainable systems, and how it allows to pose additional privacy
requirements.

\\
  With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) agents, agentic workflows are showing transformative
potential in education. This study introduces the Agentic Workflow for
Education (AWE), a four-component model comprising self-reflection, tool
invocation, task planning, and multi-agent collaboration. We distinguish AWE
from traditional LLM-based linear interactions and propose a theoretical
framework grounded in the von Neumann Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture.
Through a paradigm shift from static prompt-response systems to dynamic,
nonlinear workflows, AWE enables scalable, personalized, and collaborative task
execution. We further identify four core application domains: integrated
learning environments, personalized AI-assisted learning, simulation-based
experimentation, and data-driven decision-making. A case study on automated
math test generation shows that AWE-generated items are statistically
comparable to real exam questions, validating the model's effectiveness. AWE
offers a promising path toward reducing teacher workload, enhancing
instructional quality, and enabling broader educational innovation.

  Trisomy 21 results in Down syndrome, a multifaceted genetic disorder with
diverse clinical phenotypes, including heart defects, immune dysfunction,
neurodevelopmental differences, and early-onset dementia risk. Heterogeneity
and fragmented data across studies challenge comprehensive research and
translational discovery. The NIH INCLUDE (INvestigation of Co-occurring
conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) initiative has
assembled harmonized participant-level datasets, yet realizing their potential
requires integrative analytical frameworks. We developed a knowledge
graph-driven platform transforming nine INCLUDE studies, comprising 7,148
participants, 456 conditions, 501 phenotypes, and over 37,000 biospecimens,
into a unified semantic infrastructure. Cross-resource enrichment with Monarch
Initiative data expands coverage to 4,281 genes and 7,077 variants. The
resulting knowledge graph contains over 1.6 million semantic associations,
enabling AI-ready analysis with graph embeddings and path-based reasoning for
hypothesis generation. Researchers can query the graph via SPARQL or natural
language interfaces. This framework converts static data repositories into
dynamic discovery environments, supporting cross-study pattern recognition,
predictive modeling, and systematic exploration of genotype-phenotype
relationships in Down syndrome.

\\
  Audio Chord Estimation (ACE) holds a pivotal role in music information
research, having garnered attention for over two decades due to its relevance
for music transcription and analysis. Despite notable advancements, challenges
persist in the task, particularly concerning unique characteristics of harmonic
content, which have resulted in existing systems' performances reaching a glass
ceiling. These challenges include annotator subjectivity, where varying
interpretations among annotators lead to inconsistencies, and class imbalance
within chord datasets, where certain chord classes are over-represented
compared to others, posing difficulties in model training and evaluation. As a
first contribution, this paper presents an evaluation of inter-annotator
agreement in chord annotations, using metrics that extend beyond traditional
binary measures. In addition, we propose a consonance-informed distance metric
that reflects the perceptual similarity between harmonic annotations. Our
analysis suggests that consonance-based distance metrics more effectively
capture musically meaningful agreement between annotations. Expanding on these
findings, we introduce a novel ACE conformer-based model that integrates
consonance concepts into the model through consonance-based label smoothing.
The proposed model also addresses class imbalance by separately estimating
root, bass, and all note activations, enabling the reconstruction of chord
labels from decomposed outputs.

  Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) play a vital role in ensuring public
safety across various settings, from nuclear facilities to medical
environments. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to
cyber-attacks such as data injection, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, ICMP
floods, botnet attacks, privilege escalation, and distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attacks. Such threats could compromise the integrity and reliability of
radiation measurements, posing significant public health and safety risks. This
paper presents a new synthetic radiation dataset and an Intrusion Detection
System (IDS) tailored for resource-constrained environments, bringing Machine
Learning (ML) predictive capabilities closer to the sensing edge layer of
critical infrastructure. Leveraging TinyML techniques, the proposed IDS employs
an optimized XGBoost model enhanced with pruning, quantization, feature
selection, and sampling. These TinyML techniques significantly reduce the size
of the model and computational demands, enabling real-time intrusion detection
on low-resource devices while maintaining a reasonable balance between
efficiency and accuracy.

  Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) are used to measure and detect abnormal
levels of radioactive material in the environment. These systems are used in
many applications to mitigate threats posed by high levels of radioactive
material. However, these systems lack protection against malicious external
attacks to modify the data. The novelty of applying Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDS) in RDSs is a crucial element in safeguarding these critical
infrastructures. While IDSs are widely used in networking environments to
safeguard against various attacks, their application in RDSs is novel. A common
attack on RDSs is Denial of Service (DoS), where the attacker aims to overwhelm
the system, causing malfunctioning RDSs. This paper proposes an efficient
Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS to detect anomalies in radiation data, focusing
on DoS attacks. This work explores the use of sampling methods to create a
simulated DoS attack based on a real radiation dataset, followed by an
evaluation of various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector
Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine
(LightGBM), to detect DoS attacks on RDSs. LightGBM is emphasized for its
superior accuracy and low computational resource consumption, making it
particularly suitable for real-time intrusion detection. Additionally, model
optimization and TinyML techniques, including feature selection, parallel
execution, and random search methods, are used to improve the efficiency of the
proposed IDS. Finally, an optimized and efficient LightGBM-based IDS is
developed to achieve accurate intrusion detection for RDSs.

Authors: Chris Partridge, Andrew Mitchell, Sergio de Cesare and Oscar Xiberta
  Soto
Categories: cs.DB cs.AI cs.SE
Comments: Fundamentals of Conceptual Modeling - ER2025 Workshop
ACM-class: D.2.10
\\
  If one looks at contemporary mainstream development practices for conceptual
modelling in computer science, these so clearly focus on a conceptual schema
completely separated from its information base that the conceptual schema is
often just called the conceptual model. These schema-centric practices are
crystallized in almost every database textbook. We call this strong, almost
universal, bias towards conceptual schemas the schema turn. The focus of this
paper is on disentangling this turn within (computer science) conceptual
modeling. It aims to shed some light on how it emerged and so show that it is
not fundamental. To show that modern technology enables the adoption of an
inclusive schema-and-base conceptual modelling approach, which in turn enables
more automated, and empirically motivated practices. And to show, more
generally, the space of possible conceptual modelling practices is wider than
currently assumed. It also uses the example of bCLEARer to show that the
implementations in this wider space will probably need to rely on new
pipeline-based conceptual modelling techniques. So, it is possible that the
schema turn's complete exclusion of the information base could be merely a
temporary evolutionary detour.

Title: Non-Identical Diffusion Models in MIMO-OFDM Channel Generation
Authors: Yuzhi Yang and Omar Alhussein and M\'erouane Debbah
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  We propose a novel diffusion model, termed the non-identical diffusion model,
and investigate its application to wireless orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) channel generation. Unlike the standard diffusion model
that uses a scalar-valued time index to represent the global noise level, we
extend this notion to an element-wise time indicator to capture local error
variations more accurately. Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize
the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy
input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is
biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates
exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme.
Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to
capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a
matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression.
Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the
correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme
both theoretically and numerically. For MIMO-OFDM channel generation, we
propose a dimension-wise time embedding strategy. We also develop and evaluate
multiple training and generation methods and compare them through numerical
experiments.

Title: Data Retrieval with Importance Weights for Few-Shot Imitation Learning
Authors: Amber Xie, Rahul Chand, Dorsa Sadigh, Joey Hejna
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
Comments: Conference on Robot Learning 2025
\\
  While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation
learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for
deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot
imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts
relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a
limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior
datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data
point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.
While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data
selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel
density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two
shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on
high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,
it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To
address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which
estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data
distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the
probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,
and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates
using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world
evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently
improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only
requiring minor modifications.

  Although current large audio language models (LALMs) extend text large
language models (LLMs) with generic acoustic understanding abilities, they
usually suffer from instruction sensitivity, where different instructions of
the same intention can yield drastically different outcomes. In this work, we
propose AHAMask, where we simply mask some of the attention heads in the
decoder-only LLM backbone of LALMs, to trigger specific acoustic task
functionalities without instructions. These masks are efficiently obtained by
training on an LALM, with the number of trainable parameters equal to the
attention head count in its LLM backbone. We show by experiments that applying
such selective attention head masks achieves comparable or even better
performance than using instructions, either on single or composite tasks.
Besides achieving reliable acoustic task specification for LALMs, this also
reveals that LALMs exhibit certain "functional pathways" in their attention
heads.

  Every day, our inboxes are flooded with unsolicited emails, ranging between
annoying spam to more subtle phishing scams. Unfortunately, despite abundant
prior efforts proposing solutions achieving near-perfect accuracy, the reality
is that countering malicious emails still remains an unsolved dilemma.
  This "open problem" paper carries out a critical assessment of scientific
works in the context of phishing email detection. First, we focus on the
benchmark datasets that have been used to assess the methods proposed in
research. We find that most prior work relied on datasets containing emails
that -- we argue -- are not representative of current trends, and mostly
encompass the English language. Based on this finding, we then re-implement and
re-assess a variety of detection methods reliant on machine learning (ML),
including large-language models (LLM), and release all of our codebase -- an
(unfortunately) uncommon practice in related research. We show that most such
methods achieve near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same
dataset -- a result which intrinsically hinders development (how can future
research outperform methods that are already near perfect?). To foster the
creation of "more challenging benchmarks" that reflect current phishing trends,
we propose E-PhishGEN, an LLM-based (and privacy-savvy) framework to generate
novel phishing-email datasets. We use our E-PhishGEN to create E-PhishLLM, a
novel phishing-email detection dataset containing 16616 emails in three
languages. We use E-PhishLLM to test the detectors we considered, showing a
much lower performance than that achieved on existing benchmarks -- indicating
a larger room for improvement. We also validate the quality of E-PhishLLM with
a user study (n=30). To sum up, we show that phishing email detection is still
an open problem -- and provide the means to tackle such a problem by future
research.

\\
  Intrusion detection in unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) swarms is complicated by
high mobility, non-stationary traffic, and severe class imbalance. Leveraging a
120 k-flow simulation corpus that covers five attack types, we benchmark three
quantum-machine-learning (QML) approaches - quantum kernels, variational
quantum neural networks (QNNs), and hybrid quantum-trained neural networks
(QT-NNs) - against strong classical baselines. All models consume an 8-feature
flow representation and are evaluated under identical preprocessing, balancing,
and noise-model assumptions. We analyse the influence of encoding strategy,
circuit depth, qubit count, and shot noise, reporting accuracy, macro-F1,
ROC-AUC, Matthews correlation, and quantum-resource footprints. Results reveal
clear trade-offs: quantum kernels and QT-NNs excel in low-data, nonlinear
regimes, while deeper QNNs suffer from trainability issues, and CNNs dominate
when abundant data offset their larger parameter count. The complete codebase
and dataset partitions are publicly released to enable reproducible QML
research in network security.

\\
  This study examines journalists' perceptions of the impact of artificial
intelligence (AI) on disinformation, a growing concern in journalism due to the
rapid expansion of generative AI and its influence on news production and media
organizations. Using a quantitative approach, a structured survey was
administered to 504 journalists in the Basque Country, identified through
official media directories and with the support of the Basque Association of
Journalists. This survey, conducted online and via telephone between May and
June 2024, included questions on sociodemographic and professional variables,
as well as attitudes toward AI's impact on journalism. The results indicate
that a large majority of journalists (89.88%) believe AI will considerably or
significantly increase the risks of disinformation, and this perception is
consistent across genders and media types, but more pronounced among those with
greater professional experience. Statistical analyses reveal a significant
association between years of experience and perceived risk, and between AI use
and risk perception. The main risks identified are the difficulty in detecting
false content and deepfakes, and the risk of obtaining inaccurate or erroneous
data. Co-occurrence analysis shows that these risks are often perceived as
interconnected. These findings highlight the complex and multifaceted concerns
of journalists regarding AI's role in the information ecosystem.

interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We
present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction
with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the
framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future
trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical
features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations
for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both
local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale
real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates
superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement
errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework
further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to
strengthen maritime safety and decision support.

Title: HodgeFormer: Transformers for Learnable Operators on Triangular Meshes
  through Data-Driven Hodge Matrices
Authors: Akis Nousias and Stavros Nousias
Categories: cs.GR cs.AI cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages, 11 figures, 9 tables
\\
  Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes
for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily
utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based
methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional
embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations,
e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then
concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach
inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in
Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and
exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust
the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the
multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$,
$\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act
on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a
computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in
mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning
framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition
operations or complex preprocessing operations.

  This paper presents an overview of a human-centered initiative aimed at
strengthening climate resilience along Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore. This
region, a collection of rural villages with deep ties to the sea, faces
existential threats from climate change that endanger its way of life. Our
project moves beyond a purely technical response, weaving together expertise
from Computer Science, Industrial Engineering, and Coastal Geography to
co-create tools with the community. By integrating generational knowledge of
residents, particularly elders, through the Eastern Shore Citizen Science
Coastal Monitoring Network, this project aims to collaborate in building a
living digital archive. This effort is hosted under Dalhousie University's
Transforming Climate Action (TCA) initiative, specifically through its
Transformative Adaptations to Social-Ecological Climate Change Trajectories
(TranSECT) and TCA Artificial Intelligence (TCA-AI) projects. This work is
driven by a collaboration model in which student teams work directly with
residents. We present a detailed project timeline and a replicable model for
how technology can support traditional communities, enabling them to navigate
climate transformation more effectively.

Title: Empowering Large Language Model for Sequential Recommendation via
  Multimodal Embeddings and Semantic IDs

\\
  Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to capture users' dynamic interests and
sequential patterns based on their historical interactions. Recently, the
powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have driven their
adoption in SR. However, we identify two critical challenges in existing
LLM-based SR methods: 1) embedding collapse when incorporating pre-trained
collaborative embeddings and 2) catastrophic forgetting of quantized embeddings
when utilizing semantic IDs. These issues dampen the model scalability and lead
to suboptimal recommendation performance. Therefore, based on LLMs like
Llama3-8B-instruct, we introduce a novel SR framework named MME-SID, which
integrates multimodal embeddings and quantized embeddings to mitigate embedding
collapse. Additionally, we propose a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE) with maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction
loss and contrastive learning for alignment, which effectively preserve
intra-modal distance information and capture inter-modal correlations,
respectively. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we initialize the
model with the trained multimodal code embeddings. Finally, we fine-tune the
LLM efficiently using LoRA in a multimodal frequency-aware fusion manner.
Extensive experiments on three public datasets validate the superior
performance of MME-SID thanks to its capability to mitigate embedding collapse
and catastrophic forgetting. The implementation code and datasets are publicly
available for reproduction:

Title: Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Based Task-Driven MIMO System for Image
  Transmission
Authors: Sijiang Li, Rongqing Zhang, Xiang Cheng, Jian Tang
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI
\\
  To support cooperative perception (CP) of networked mobile agents in dynamic
scenarios, the efficient and robust transmission of sensory data is a critical
challenge. Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has
demonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel
conditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works
have explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the
discrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the
limited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP
tasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this
paper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system
for image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO. By leveraging the structural
properties of the feature pyramid for perceptual tasks and the channel
properties of the closed-loop MIMO communication system, SoM-MIMO enables
efficient and robust digital MIMO transmission of images. Experimental results
have shown that compared with two JSCC baseline schemes, our approach achieves
average mAP improvements of 6.30 and 10.48 across all SNR levels, while
maintaining identical communication overhead.

Title: Align-Then-stEer: Adapting the Vision-Language Action Models through
  Unified Latent Guidance
Authors: Yang Zhang, Chenwei Wang, Ouyang Lu, Yuan Zhao, Yunfei Ge, Zhenglong

\\
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets
show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a
primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks,
especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the
pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action
distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning.
To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer
(\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation
framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a
unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL
divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action
latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's
generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the
model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive
experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation
and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our
method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in
simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a
real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and
lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA
models to new robotic platforms and tasks.

Title: Learning Social Heuristics for Human-Aware Path Planning
Authors: Andrea Eirale, Matteo Leonetti, Marcello Chiaberge
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in
recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent
along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and
predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really
be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms
that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated
learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value
(HPLSV), a method to learn a value function encapsulating the cost of social
navigation, and use it as an additional heuristic in heuristic-search path
planning. In this preliminary work, we apply the methodology to the common
social scenario of joining a queue of people, with the intention of
generalizing to further human activities.

Title: A Theoretical Framework of the Processes of Change in Psychotherapy
  Delivered by Artificial Agents
Authors: Arthur Bran Herbener and Malene Flensborg Damholdt
Categories: cs.HC cs.AI
Comments: Submitted on 19 March 2025
\\
  The question of whether artificial agents (e.g., chatbots and social robots)
can replace human therapists has received notable attention following the
recent launch of large language models. However, little is known about the
processes of change in psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. To
facilitate hypothesis development and stimulate scientific debate, the present
article offers the first theoretical framework of the processes of change in
psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. The theoretical framework rests
upon a conceptual analysis of what active ingredients may be inherently linked
to the presence of human therapists. We propose that human therapists'
ontological status as human beings and sociocultural status as socially
sanctioned healthcare professionals play crucial roles in promoting treatment
outcomes. In the absence of the ontological and sociocultural status of human
therapists, we propose what we coin the genuineness gap and credibility gap can
emerge and undermine key processes of change in psychotherapy. Based on these
propositions, we propose avenues for scientific investigations and practical
applications aimed at leveraging the strengths of artificial agents and human
therapists respectively. We also highlight the intricate agentic nature of
artificial agents and discuss how this complicates endeavors to establish
universally applicable propositions regarding the processes of change in these
interventions.

Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Integrating large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
revolutionised embodied artificial intelligence, enabling advanced
decision-making and adaptability. However, ensuring reliability, encompassing
both security against adversarial attacks and safety in complex environments,
remains a critical challenge. To address this, we propose a unified framework
that mitigates prompt injection attacks while enforcing operational safety
through robust validation mechanisms. Our approach combines prompt assembling,
state management, and safety validation, evaluated using both performance and
security metrics. Experiments show a 30.8% improvement under injection attacks
and up to a 325% improvement in complex environment settings under adversarial
conditions compared to baseline scenarios. This work bridges the gap between
safety and security in LLM-based robotic systems, offering actionable insights
for deploying reliable LLM-integrated mobile robots in real-world settings. The
framework is open-sourced with simulation and physical deployment demos at

Title: Beyond Ensembles: Simulating All-Atom Protein Dynamics in a Learned
  Latent Space
Authors: Aditya Sengar, Ali Hariri, Pierre Vandergheynst, Patrick Barth
Categories: q-bio.BM cs.AI
\\
  Simulating the long-timescale dynamics of biomolecules is a central challenge
in computational science. While enhanced sampling methods can accelerate these
simulations, they rely on pre-defined collective variables that are often
difficult to identify. A recent generative model, LD-FPG, demonstrated that
this problem could be bypassed by learning to sample the static equilibrium
ensemble as all-atom deformations from a reference structure, establishing a
powerful method for all-atom ensemble generation. However, while this approach
successfully captures a system's probable conformations, it does not model the
temporal evolution between them. Here we extend LD-FPG with a temporal
propagator that operates within the learned latent space and compare three
classes: (i) score-guided Langevin dynamics, (ii) Koopman-based linear
operators, and (iii) autoregressive neural networks. Within a unified
encoder-propagator-decoder framework, we evaluate long-horizon stability,
backbone and side-chain ensemble fidelity, and functional free-energy
landscapes. Autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long
rollouts; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when
the score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight
baseline that tends to damp fluctuations. These results clarify the trade-offs
among propagators and offer practical guidance for latent-space simulators of
all-atom protein dynamics.

their perceived experience. Our vision to balance news consumption points to
other positive effects for users (e.g., increased serendipity) and society

Title: Application Of Large Language Models For The Extraction Of Information

Categories: cs.IR cs.AI physics.acc-ph
\\
  The large set of technical documentation of legacy accelerator systems,
coupled with the retirement of experienced personnel, underscores the urgent
need for efficient methods to preserve and transfer specialized knowledge. This
paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs), to automate and
enhance the extraction of information from particle accelerator technical
documents. By exploiting LLMs, we aim to address the challenges of knowledge
retention, enabling the retrieval of domain expertise embedded in legacy
documentation. We present initial results of adapting LLMs to this specialized
domain. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in extracting,
summarizing, and organizing knowledge, significantly reducing the risk of
losing valuable insights as personnel retire. Furthermore, we discuss the
limitations of current LLMs, such as interpretability and handling of rare
domain-specific terms, and propose strategies for improvement. This work
highlights the potential of LLMs to play a pivotal role in preserving
institutional knowledge and ensuring continuity in highly specialized fields.

Title: Autoencoder-based non-intrusive model order reduction in continuum
  mechanics
Authors: Jannick Kehls, Ellen Kuhl, Tim Brepols, Kevin Linka, Hagen Holthusen
Categories: cs.CE cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  We propose a non-intrusive, Autoencoder-based framework for reduced-order
modeling in continuum mechanics. Our method integrates three stages: (i) an
unsupervised Autoencoder compresses high-dimensional finite element solutions
into a compact latent space, (ii) a supervised regression network maps problem
parameters to latent codes, and (iii) an end-to-end surrogate reconstructs
full-field solutions directly from input parameters.
  To overcome limitations of existing approaches, we propose two key
extensions: a force-augmented variant that jointly predicts displacement fields
and reaction forces at Neumann boundaries, and a multi-field architecture that
enables coupled field predictions, such as in thermo-mechanical systems. The
framework is validated on nonlinear benchmark problems involving heterogeneous
composites, anisotropic elasticity with geometric variation, and
thermo-mechanical coupling. Across all cases, it achieves accurate
reconstructions of high-fidelity solutions while remaining fully non-intrusive.
  These results highlight the potential of combining deep learning with
dimensionality reduction to build efficient and extensible surrogate models.
Our publicly available implementation provides a foundation for integrating
data-driven model order reduction into uncertainty quantification,
optimization, and digital twin applications.

Title: Think2Sing: Orchestrating Structured Motion Subtitles for Singing-Driven
  3D Head Animation
Authors: Zikai Huang, Yihan Zhou, Xuemiao Xu, Cheng Xu, Xiaofen Xing, Jing Qin,
  Shengfeng He
Categories: cs.GR cs.AI cs.MM
\\
  Singing-driven 3D head animation is a challenging yet promising task with
applications in virtual avatars, entertainment, and education. Unlike speech,
singing involves richer emotional nuance, dynamic prosody, and lyric-based
semantics, requiring the synthesis of fine-grained, temporally coherent facial
motion. Existing speech-driven approaches often produce oversimplified,
emotionally flat, and semantically inconsistent results, which are insufficient
for singing animation. To address this, we propose Think2Sing, a
diffusion-based framework that leverages pretrained large language models to
generate semantically coherent and temporally consistent 3D head animations,
conditioned on both lyrics and acoustics. A key innovation is the introduction
of motion subtitles, an auxiliary semantic representation derived through a
novel Singing Chain-of-Thought reasoning process combined with acoustic-guided
retrieval. These subtitles contain precise timestamps and region-specific
motion descriptions, serving as interpretable motion priors. We frame the task
as a motion intensity prediction problem, enabling finer control over facial
regions and improving the modeling of expressive motion. To support this, we
create a multimodal singing dataset with synchronized video, acoustic
descriptors, and motion subtitles, enabling diverse and expressive motion
learning. Extensive experiments show that Think2Sing outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in realism, expressiveness, and emotional fidelity,
while also offering flexible, user-controllable animation editing.

Title: ReCode: Improving LLM-based Code Repair with Fine-Grained
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Authors: Yicong Zhao, Shisong Chen, Jiacheng Zhang, Zhixu Li
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
Comments: Accepted by CIKM 2025
\\
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in code-related tasks, such as code generation and automated
program repair. Despite their promising performance, most existing approaches
for code repair suffer from high training costs or computationally expensive
inference. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with its efficient in-context
learning paradigm, offers a more scalable alternative. However, conventional
retrieval strategies, which are often based on holistic code-text embeddings,
fail to capture the structural intricacies of code, resulting in suboptimal
retrieval quality. To address the above limitations, we propose ReCode, a
fine-grained retrieval-augmented in-context learning framework designed for
accurate and efficient code repair. Specifically, ReCode introduces two key
innovations: (1) an algorithm-aware retrieval strategy that narrows the search
space using preliminary algorithm type predictions; and (2) a modular
dual-encoder architecture that separately processes code and textual inputs,
enabling fine-grained semantic matching between input and retrieved contexts.
Furthermore, we propose RACodeBench, a new benchmark constructed from
real-world user-submitted buggy code, which addresses the limitations of
synthetic benchmarks and supports realistic evaluation. Experimental results on
RACodeBench and competitive programming datasets demonstrate that ReCode
achieves higher repair accuracy with significantly reduced inference cost,
highlighting its practical value for real-world code repair scenarios.

Categories: cs.SD cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied in speech
and music. This tendency has led to a focus on audio tokenization for Large
Models (LMs). Unlike semantic-only text tokens, audio tokens must both capture
global semantic content and preserve fine-grained acoustic details. Moreover,
they provide a discrete method for speech and music that can be effectively
integrated into MLLMs. However, existing research is unsuitable in the
definitions of semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. In addition, the evaluation
of different codecs typically concentrates on specific domains or tasks, such
as reconstruction or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task, which prevents
fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address these problems, this paper
provides suitable definitions for semantic and acoustic tokens and introduces a
systematic evaluation framework. This framework allows for a comprehensive
assessment of codecs' capabilities which evaluate across four dimensions: audio
reconstruction metric, codebook index (ID) stability, decoder-only transformer
perplexity, and performance on downstream probe tasks. Our results show the
correctness of the provided suitable definitions and the correlation among
reconstruction metrics, codebook ID stability, downstream probe tasks and
perplexity.

  In recent years, the space community has been exploring the possibilities of
Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs),
for a variety of on board applications. However, this development is limited by
the restricted energy budget of smallsats and cubesats as well as radiation
concerns plaguing modern chips. This necessitates research into neural network
accelerators capable of meeting these requirements whilst satisfying the
compute and performance needs of the application. This paper explores the use
of Phase-Change Memory (PCM) and Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM)
memristors for on-board in-memory computing AI acceleration in space
applications. A guidance and control neural network (G\&CNET) accelerated using
memristors is simulated in a variety of scenarios and with both device types to
evaluate the performance of memristor-based accelerators, considering device
non-idealities such as noise and conductance drift. We show that the memristive
accelerator is able to learn the expert actions, though challenges remain with
the impact of noise on accuracy. We also show that re-training after
degradation is able to restore performance to nominal levels. This study
provides a foundation for future research into memristor-based AI accelerators
for space, highlighting their potential and the need for further investigation.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become critical to modern software
development, but their reliance on internet datasets for training introduces a
significant security risk: the absorption and reproduction of malicious
content. To evaluate this threat, this paper introduces a scalable, automated
audit framework that synthesizes innocuous, developer-style prompts from known
scam databases to query production LLMs and determine if they generate code
containing harmful URLs. We conducted a large-scale evaluation across four
production LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Scout, and DeepSeek-V3), and
found a systemic vulnerability, with all tested models generating malicious
code at a non-negligible rate. On average, 4.2\% of programs generated in our
experiments contained malicious URLs. Crucially, this malicious code is often
generated in response to benign prompts. We manually validate the prompts which
cause all four LLMs to generate malicious code, and resulting in 177 innocuous
prompts that trigger all models to produce harmful outputs. These results
provide strong empirical evidence that the training data of production LLMs has
been successfully poisoned at scale, underscoring the urgent need for more
robust defense mechanisms and post-generation safety checks to mitigate the
propagation of hidden security threats.

Title: Real-time ML-based Defense Against Malicious Payload in Reconfigurable
  Embedded Systems
Authors: Rye Stahle-Smith and Rasha Karakchi

Comments: This paper is submitted at Supercomputing (SC'25)
\\
  The growing use of FPGAs in reconfigurable systems introducessecurity risks
through malicious bitstreams that could cause denial-of-service (DoS), data
leakage, or covert attacks. We investigated chip-level hardware malicious
payload in embedded systems and proposed a supervised machine learning method
to detect malicious bitstreams via static byte-level features. Our approach
diverges from existing methods by analyzing bitstreams directly at the binary
level, enabling real-time detection without requiring access to source code or
netlists. Bitstreams were sourced from state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks and
re-engineered to target the Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA Development Board. Our dataset
included 122 samples of benign and malicious configurations. The data were
vectorized using byte frequency analysis, compressed using TSVD, and balanced
using SMOTE to address class imbalance. The evaluated classifiers demonstrated
that Random Forest achieved a macro F1-score of 0.97, underscoring the
viability of real-time Trojan detection on resource-constrained systems. The
final model was serialized and successfully deployed via PYNQ to enable
integrated bitstream analysis.

\\
  Mobile Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing diverse fields such
as healthcare, finance, and education with their ability to perform advanced
natural language processing tasks on-the-go. However, the deployment of these
models in mobile and edge environments introduces significant challenges
related to privacy and security due to their resource-intensive nature and the
sensitivity of the data they process. This survey provides a comprehensive
overview of privacy and security issues associated with mobile LLMs,
systematically categorizing existing solutions such as differential privacy,
federated learning, and prompt encryption. Furthermore, we analyze
vulnerabilities unique to mobile LLMs, including adversarial attacks,
membership inference, and side-channel attacks, offering an in-depth comparison
of their effectiveness and limitations. Despite recent advancements, mobile
LLMs face unique hurdles in achieving robust security while maintaining
efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To bridge this gap, we propose
potential applications, discuss open challenges, and suggest future research
directions, paving the way for the development of trustworthy,
privacy-compliant, and scalable mobile LLM systems.

  Training LLMs larger than the aggregated memory of multiple GPUs is
increasingly necessary due to the faster growth of LLM sizes compared to GPU
memory. To this end, multi-tier host memory or disk offloading techniques are
proposed by state of art. Despite advanced asynchronous multi-tier read/write
strategies, such offloading strategies result in significant I/O overheads in
the critical path of training, resulting in slower iterations. To this end, we
propose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine
specifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained
setups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that
drive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update
dominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage
tier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies
I/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload
to offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and
concurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward
and update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that
MLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\times$ faster iterations compared to the
state-of-the-art LLM training runtimes.

Title: Probabilistically stable revision and comparative probability: a
  representation theorem and applications
Authors: Krzysztof Mierzewski

MSC-class: 03B42, 03B48, 03B70, 60A05, 68T27, 91B12

  The stability rule for belief, advocated by Leitgeb [Annals of Pure and
Applied Logic 164, 2013], is a rule for rational acceptance that captures
categorical belief in terms of $\textit{probabilistically stable
propositions}$: propositions to which the agent assigns resiliently high
credence. The stability rule generates a class of $\textit{probabilistically
stable belief revision}$ operators, which capture the dynamics of belief that
result from an agent updating their credences through Bayesian conditioning
while complying with the stability rule for their all-or-nothing beliefs. In
this paper, we prove a representation theorem that yields a complete
characterisation of such probabilistically stable revision operators and
provides a `qualitative' selection function semantics for the (non-monotonic)
logic of probabilistically stable belief revision. Drawing on the theory of
comparative probability orders, this result gives necessary and sufficient
conditions for a selection function to be representable as a
strongest-stable-set operator on a finite probability space. The resulting
logic of probabilistically stable belief revision exhibits strong monotonicity
properties while failing the AGM belief revision postulates and satisfying only
very weak forms of case reasoning. In showing the main theorem, we prove two
results of independent interest to the theory of comparative probability: the
first provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the joint representation
of a pair of (respectively, strict and non-strict) comparative probability
orders. The second result provides a method for axiomatising the logic of ratio
comparisons of the form ``event $A$ is at least $k$ times more likely than
event $B$''. In addition to these measurement-theoretic applications, we point
out two applications of our main result to the theory of simple voting games
and to revealed preference theory.

Title: FLM-Audio: Natural Monologues Improves Native Full-Duplex Chatbots via
  Dual Training
Authors: Yiqun Yao, Xiang Li, Xin Jiang, Xuezhi Fang, Naitong Yu, Wenjia Ma,
  Aixin Sun, Yequan Wang
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Full-duplex dialog models are designed to listen and speak simultaneously
with rapid responses to fast-changing user input. Among existing approaches,
native full-duplex models merges different channels (e.g. listen and speak) in
a single time step, overcoming the high response latency inherent to
time-division multiplexing time-division multiplexing (TDM) alternatives. Yet,
a key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that
operate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level
alignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained
models. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which
introduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper,
we propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely "natural"
monologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal
alignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or
trailing the audio - across different training stages. This "dual" training
paradigm proves highly effective in building FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog
model that demonstrates superior responsiveness, duplexity, and chatting
experiences, as confirmed by experimental results.

  Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving
articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance
degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

  The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has transformed spoken dialog
systems, yet the optimal architecture for real-time on-device voice agents
remains an open question. While end-to-end approaches promise theoretical
advantages, cascaded systems (CSs) continue to outperform them in language
understanding tasks, despite being constrained by sequential processing
latency. In this work, we introduce ChipChat, a novel low-latency CS that
overcomes traditional bottlenecks through architectural innovations and
streaming optimizations. Our system integrates streaming (a) conversational
speech recognition with mixture-of-experts, (b) state-action augmented LLM, (c)
text-to-speech synthesis, (d) neural vocoder, and (e) speaker modeling.
Implemented using MLX, ChipChat achieves sub-second response latency on a Mac
Studio without dedicated GPUs, while preserving user privacy through complete
on-device processing. Our work shows that strategically redesigned CSs can
overcome their historical latency limitations, offering a promising path
forward for practical voice-based AI agents.

Title: ERank: Fusing Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning for
  Effective and Efficient Text Reranking
Authors: Yuzheng Cai, Yanzhao Zhang, Dingkun Long, Mingxin Li, Pengjun Xie,
  Weiguo Zheng
Categories: cs.IR cs.CL
\\
  Text reranking models are a crucial component in modern systems like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, tasked with selecting the most relevant
documents prior to generation. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs)
powered rerankers often face a fundamental trade-off. On one hand, Supervised
Fine-Tuning based pointwise methods that frame relevance as a binary
classification task lack the necessary scoring discrimination, particularly for
those built on reasoning LLMs. On the other hand, approaches designed for
complex reasoning often employ powerful yet inefficient listwise formulations,
rendering them impractical for low latency applications. To resolve this
dilemma, we introduce ERank, a highly effective and efficient pointwise
reranker built from a reasoning LLM that excels across diverse relevance
scenarios. We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline that begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this stage, we move beyond binary labels and
train the model generatively to output fine grained integer scores, which
significantly enhances relevance discrimination. The model is then further
refined using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel, listwise derived
reward. This technique instills global ranking awareness into the efficient
pointwise architecture. We evaluate the ERank reranker on the BRIGHT, FollowIR,
TREC DL, and BEIR benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness and
robustness compared to existing approaches. On the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT
benchmark, our ERank-4B achieves an nDCG@10 of 38.7, while a larger 32B variant
reaches a state of the art nDCG@10 of 40.2.

Title: Hybrid Topic-Semantic Labeling and Graph Embeddings for Unsupervised
  Legal Document Clustering
Authors: Deepak Bastola and Woohyeok Choi
Categories: stat.ML cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: 20 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables
\\
  Legal documents pose unique challenges for text classification due to their
domain-specific language and often limited labeled data. This paper proposes a
hybrid approach for classifying legal texts by combining unsupervised topic and
graph embeddings with a supervised model. We employ Top2Vec to learn semantic
document embeddings and automatically discover latent topics, and Node2Vec to
capture structural relationships via a bipartite graph of legal documents. The
embeddings are combined and clustered using KMeans, yielding coherent groupings
of documents. Our computations on a legal document dataset demonstrate that the
combined Top2Vec+Node2Vec approach improves clustering quality over text-only
or graph-only embeddings. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters,
such as the number of clusters and the dimensionality of the embeddings, and
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against baseline
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
models. Key findings indicate that while the pipeline presents an innovative
approach to unsupervised legal document analysis by combining semantic topic
modeling with graph embedding techniques, its efficacy is contingent upon the
quality of initial topic generation and the representational power of the
chosen embedding models for specialized legal language. Strategic
recommendations include the exploration of domain-specific embeddings, more
comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for Node2Vec, dynamic determination of
cluster numbers, and robust human-in-the-loop validation processes to enhance
legal relevance and trustworthiness. The pipeline demonstrates potential for
exploratory legal data analysis and as a precursor to supervised learning tasks
but requires further refinement and domain-specific adaptation for practical
legal applications.

  This study presents a novel approach to voice synthesis that can substitute
the traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion by using a deep
learning-based model that generates discrete tokens directly from speech.
Utilizing a pre-trained voice SSL model, we train a T5 encoder to produce
pseudo-language labels from mixed-script texts (e.g., containing Kanji and
Kana). This method eliminates the need for manual phonetic transcription,
reducing costs and enhancing scalability, especially for large non-transcribed
audio datasets. Our model matches the performance of conventional G2P-based
text-to-speech systems and is capable of synthesizing speech that retains
natural linguistic and paralinguistic features, such as accents and
intonations.

  Speech emotion recognition is vital for human-computer interaction,
particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic, which face challenges due
to limited data and research. We introduce ArabEmoNet, a lightweight
architecture designed to overcome these limitations and deliver
state-of-the-art performance. Unlike previous systems relying on discrete MFCC
features and 1D convolutions, which miss nuanced spectro-temporal patterns,
ArabEmoNet uses Mel spectrograms processed through 2D convolutions, preserving
critical emotional cues often lost in traditional methods.
  While recent models favor large-scale architectures with millions of
parameters, ArabEmoNet achieves superior results with just 1 million
parameters, 90 times smaller than HuBERT base and 74 times smaller than
Whisper. This efficiency makes it ideal for resource-constrained environments.
ArabEmoNet advances Arabic speech emotion recognition, offering exceptional

  This work investigated about 10,000 COVID-19-related YouTube videos published
between January 2023 and October 2024 to evaluate how temporal, lexical,
linguistic, and structural factors influenced engagement during the late
pandemic period. Publishing activity showed consistent weekday effects: in the
first window, average views peaked on Mondays at 92,658; in the second, on
Wednesdays at 115,479; and in the third, on Fridays at 84,874, reflecting a
shift in audience attention toward mid- and late week. Lexical analysis of
video titles revealed recurring high-frequency keywords related to COVID-19 and
YouTube features, including COVID, coronavirus, shorts, and live. Frequency
analysis revealed sharp spikes, with COVID appearing in 799 video titles in
August 2024, while engagement analysis showed that videos titled with shorts
attracted very high views, peaking at 2.16 million average views per video in
June 2023. Analysis of sentiment of video descriptions in English showed weak
correlation with views in the raw data (Pearson r = 0.0154, p = 0.2987), but
stronger correlations emerged once outliers were addressed, with Spearman r =
0.110 (p < 0.001) and Pearson r = 0.0925 (p < 0.001). Category-level analysis
of video durations revealed contrasting outcomes: long videos focusing on
people and blogs averaged 209,114 views, short entertainment videos averaged
288,675 views, and medium-to-long news and politics videos averaged 51,309 and
59,226 views, respectively. These results demonstrate that engagement patterns
of COVID-19-related videos on YouTube during the late pandemic followed
distinct characteristics driven by publishing schedules, title vocabulary,
topics, and genre-specific duration effects.

  In the domain of security, vulnerabilities frequently remain undetected even
after their exploitation. In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly
disclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
reports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is
essential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with
immediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is
infeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14
state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying
vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate
that the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior
classification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an
F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was
observed that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet
model are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an
attack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to
those cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results
revealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the
MITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques
to vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities
related to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during
which vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the
development of more secure systems.

\\
  A prevalent shortfall among current empathic AI systems is their inability to
recognize when verbal expressions may not fully reflect underlying emotional
states. This is because the existing datasets, used for the training of these
systems, focus on surface-level emotion recognition without addressing the
complex verbal-visual incongruence (mismatch) patterns useful for empathic
understanding. In this paper, we present E-THER, the first Person-Centered
Therapy-grounded multimodal dataset with multidimensional annotations for
verbal-visual incongruence detection, enabling training of AI systems that
develop genuine rather than performative empathic capabilities. The annotations
included in the dataset are drawn from humanistic approach, i.e., identifying
verbal-visual emotional misalignment in client-counsellor interactions -
forming a framework for training and evaluating AI on empathy tasks. Additional
engagement scores provide behavioral annotations for research applications.
Notable gains in empathic and therapeutic conversational qualities are observed
in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as IDEFICS and
VideoLLAVA, using evaluation metrics grounded in empathic and therapeutic
principles. Empirical findings indicate that our incongruence-trained models
outperform general-purpose models in critical traits, such as sustaining
therapeutic engagement, minimizing artificial or exaggerated linguistic
patterns, and maintaining fidelity to PCT theoretical framework.

mel-spectrogram, treating it as a 2D data and quantizing non-overlapping 4x4
patches into a single, shared codebook. This patchwise design simplifies the
architecture, enables low-latency streaming, and yields a discrete latent grid.
To ensure high-fidelity synthesis, we employ a late-stage adversarial
fine-tuning for the VQ-VAE and train a HiFi-GAN vocoder from scratch on the
codec's reconstructed spectrograms. Operating at approximately 7.5 kbits/s for
16 kHz speech, our system was evaluated against several state-of-the-art neural
codecs using objective metrics such as STOI, PESQ, MCD, and ViSQOL. The results
demonstrate that our simplified, non-residual architecture achieves competitive
perceptual quality and intelligibility, validating it as an effective and open
foundation for future low-latency codec designs.

Title: Mitosis detection in domain shift scenarios: a Mamba-based approach
Authors: Gennaro Percannella, Mattia Sarno, Francesco Tortorella, Mario Vento
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: Approach for MIDOG 2025 track 1
\\
  Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Title: A multi-task neural network for atypical mitosis recognition under
  domain shift
Authors: Gennaro Percannella, Mattia Sarno, Francesco Tortorella, Mario Vento
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: Approach for MIDOG25 track 2
\\
  Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training
Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25
challenge.

\\
  Robotic practices on the construction site emerge as an attention-attracting
manner owing to their capability of tackle complex challenges, especially in
the rebar-involved scenarios. Most of existing products and research are mainly
focused on flat rebar setting with model training demands. To fulfill this gap,
we propose OpenTie, a 3D training-free rebar tying framework utilizing a
RGB-to-point-cloud generation and an open-vocabulary detection. We implements
the OpenTie via a robotic arm with a binocular camera and guarantees a high
accuracy by applying the prompt-based object detection method on the image
filtered by our propose post-processing procedure based a image to point cloud
generation framework. The system is flexible for horizontal and vertical rebar
tying tasks and the experiments on the real-world rebar setting verifies that
the effectiveness of the system in practice.

Title: Hybrid Perception and Equivariant Diffusion for Robust Multi-Node Rebar
  Tying

\\
  Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete
construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk.
Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the
tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in
congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and
motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with
Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust
multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module
utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature
extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars,
identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking,
even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on
Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate
sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying
efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including
single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high
success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with
conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual
parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable
multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result
underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to
enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and
labor efficiency.

Title: 3D-LATTE: Latent Space 3D Editing from Textual Instructions
Authors: Maria Parelli, Michael Oechsle, Michael Niemeyer, Federico Tombari,
  Andreas Geiger
Categories: cs.GR cs.CV
\\
  Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for
text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets
lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason
is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing
signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing
strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the
latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate
3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the
generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization
guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement
step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods
enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes
and semantic manipulations.

  The trajectory data of traffic participants (TPs) is a fundamental resource
for evaluating traffic conditions and optimizing policies, especially at urban
intersections. Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing
datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information
richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a
fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban
signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for
drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection
types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000
TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts
per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides
comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw
videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements
validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification
of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of
interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining,
traffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research.

  Free-roaming dollies enhance filmmaking with dynamic movement, but challenges
in automated camera control remain unresolved. Our study advances this field by
applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automate dolly-in shots using
free-roaming ground-based filming robots, overcoming traditional control
hurdles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of combined control for precise film
tasks by comparing it to independent control strategies. Our robust RL pipeline
surpasses traditional Proportional-Derivative controller performance in
simulation and proves its efficacy in real-world tests on a modified ROSBot 2.0
platform equipped with a camera turret. This validates our approach's
practicality and sets the stage for further research in complex filming
scenarios, contributing significantly to the fusion of technology with
cinematic creativity. This work presents a leap forward in the field and opens
new avenues for research and development, effectively bridging the gap between
technological advancement and creative filmmaking.

  We present Galaxea Open-World Dataset, a large-scale, diverse collection of
robot behaviors recorded in authentic human living and working environments.
All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired
with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and
evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework
that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained
using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training,
single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A
comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and
long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our
approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage,
together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in
achieving strong performance.

\\
  Accurate segmentation of lesions in longitudinal whole-body CT is essential
for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. While automated
methods benefit from incorporating longitudinal information, they remain
limited in their ability to consistently track individual lesions across time.
Task 2 of the autoPET/CT IV Challenge addresses this by providing lesion
localizations and baseline delineations, framing the problem as longitudinal
promptable segmentation. In this work, we extend the recently proposed LongiSeg
framework with promptable capabilities, enabling lesion-specific tracking
through point and mask interactions. To address the limited size of the
provided training set, we leverage large-scale pretraining on a synthetic
longitudinal CT dataset. Our experiments show that pretraining substantially
improves the ability to exploit longitudinal context, yielding an improvement
of up to 6 Dice points compared to models trained from scratch. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of combining longitudinal context with
interactive prompting for robust lesion tracking. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LongiSeg/tree/autoPET.

Title: IntrinsicReal: Adapting IntrinsicAnything from Synthetic to Real Objects
Authors: Xiaokang Wei and Zizheng Yan and Zhangyang Xiong and Yiming Hao and
  Yipeng Qin and Xiaoguang Han
Categories: cs.GR cs.CV
\\
  Estimating albedo (a.k.a., intrinsic image decomposition) from single RGB
images captured in real-world environments (e.g., the MVImgNet dataset)
presents a significant challenge due to the absence of paired images and their
ground truth albedos. Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything)
have achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they
remain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g.,
Objaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the
large domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal
generalization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing
IntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the
above-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition.
Specifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by
fine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual
pseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence
threshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative
preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This
strategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality
outputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for
sub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become
more accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that
sequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt
IntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our
IntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Comments: Submitted to 39th International Conference on VLSI Design, 2026
\\
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require highly efficient matrix multiplication
engines for complex computations. This paper presents a systolic array
architecture incorporating novel exact and approximate processing elements
(PEs), designed using energy-efficient positive partial product and negative
partial product cells, termed as PPC and NPPC, respectively. The proposed 8-bit
exact and approximate PE designs are employed in a 8x8 systolic array, which
achieves a energy savings of 22% and 32%, respectively, compared to the
existing design. To demonstrate their effectiveness, the proposed PEs are
integrated into a systolic array (SA) for Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
computation, achieving high output quality with a PSNR of 38.21,dB.
Furthermore, in an edge detection application using convolution, the
approximate PE achieves a PSNR of 30.45,dB. These results highlight the
potential of the proposed design to deliver significant energy efficiency while
maintaining competitive output quality, making it well-suited for
error-resilient image and vision processing applications.

  As early detection of breast cancer strongly favors successful therapeutic
outcomes, there is major commercial interest in optimizing breast cancer
screening. However, current risk prediction models achieve modest performance
and do not incorporate digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, which was
FDA-approved for breast cancer screening in 2011. To address this unmet need,
we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework capable of forecasting an
individual patient's 5-year breast cancer risk directly from screening DBT.
Using an unparalleled dataset of 161,753 DBT examinations from 50,590 patients,
we trained a risk predictor based on features extracted using the Meta AI
DINOv2 image encoder, combined with a cumulative hazard layer, to assess a
patient's likelihood of developing breast cancer over five years. On a held-out
test set, our best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.80 on predictions
within 5 years. These findings reveal the high potential of DBT-based DL
approaches to complement traditional risk assessment tools, and serve as a
promising basis for additional investigation to validate and enhance our work.

Title: GS-TG: 3D Gaussian Splatting Accelerator with Tile Grouping for Reducing
  Redundant Sorting while Preserving Rasterization Efficiency
Authors: Joongho Jo, Jongsun Park
Categories: cs.AR cs.CV
Comments: DAC 2025
\\
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a promising alternative to
neural radiance fields (NeRF) as it offers high speed as well as high image
quality in novel view synthesis. Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still
struggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time
applications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based
accelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting
operations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical
trade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively
reduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary
rasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG
groups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across
tiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During
rasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small
tiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG
enables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping
tiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with
the original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is
a lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be
seamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental
results show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over
state-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators.

Title: Protocol for Clustering 4DSTEM Data for Phase Differentiation in Glasses
Authors: Mridul Kumar, Yevgeny Rakita
Categories: cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in
non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching
between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties
are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure,
which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply
unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron
microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural
heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction
with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with
t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette
scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the
diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures
change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium
in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4.
Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed
structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering
analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and
structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic
heterogeneity.

  To develop and externally validate integrated ultrasound nomograms combining
BIRADS features and quantitative morphometric characteristics, and to compare
their performance with expert radiologists and state of the art large language
models in biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction for breast lesions.
In this retrospective multicenter, multinational study, 1747 women with
pathologically confirmed breast lesions underwent ultrasound across three
centers in Iran and Turkey. A total of 10 BIRADS and 26 morphological features
were extracted from each lesion. A BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomogram
integrating both feature sets was constructed via logistic regression. Three
radiologists (one senior, two general) and two ChatGPT variants independently
interpreted deidentified breast lesion images. Diagnostic performance for
biopsy recommendation (BIRADS 4,5) and malignancy prediction was assessed in
internal and two external validation cohorts. In pooled analysis, the fused
nomogram achieved the highest accuracy for biopsy recommendation (83.0%) and
malignancy prediction (83.8%), outperforming the morphometric nomogram, three
radiologists and both ChatGPT models. Its AUCs were 0.901 and 0.853 for the two
tasks, respectively. In addition, the performance of the BIRADS nomogram was
significantly higher than the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and
both ChatGPT models for biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction.
External validation confirmed the robust generalizability across different
ultrasound platforms and populations. An integrated BIRADS morphometric
nomogram consistently outperforms standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists in
guiding biopsy decisions and predicting malignancy. These interpretable,
externally validated tools have the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies
and enhance personalized decision making in breast imaging.

  Generative models for high-quality materials are particularly desirable to
make 3D content authoring more accessible. However, the majority of material
generation methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides
precise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to
create a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively,
recent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee
realism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these
limitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that
leverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of
realistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune
a pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged
in $2 \times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while
learning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this
creates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We
propose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL),
encouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward
function for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a
large-scale dataset of realistic material images. We show that this approach
increases generated materials' realism compared to our base model and related
work.

  Eye movements can reveal early signs of neurodegeneration, including those
associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This work investigates the utility of
a set of gaze-based features for the automatic screening of PD from different
visual exploration tasks. For this purpose, a novel methodology is introduced,
combining classic fixation/saccade oculomotor features (e.g., saccade count,
fixation duration, scanned area) with features derived from gaze clusters
(i.e., regions with a considerable accumulation of fixations). These features
are automatically extracted from six exploration tests and evaluated using
different machine learning classifiers. A Mixture of Experts ensemble is used
to integrate outputs across tests and both eyes. Results show that ensemble
models outperform individual classifiers, achieving an Area Under the Receiving
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.95 on a held-out test set. The
findings support visual exploration as a non-invasive tool for early automatic
screening of PD.

  This user manual is intended to provide a detailed description on model-based
optimization for imaging inverse problem. Theseproblems can be particularly
complex and challenging, especially for individuals without prior exposure to
convex optimization orinverse problem theory, like myself. In light of this, I
am writing this manual to clarify and systematically organize the

not be accurate in mathmatical notion but more focus on the logicalthinking on
how to solve and proceed to solve the problems. If you want to think deep about
something, try to raise questions! Thismanual is seaprated into four sections,
aiming to answer the following four questions: (1) What is inverse imaging
problem? (2) Why optimization is used to solve the inverse imaging problem? (3)
How to solve the optimization problem? (4) How to implement the optimization
algorithm in real imaging system?

Title: Aleatoric Uncertainty from AI-based 6D Object Pose Predictors for
  Object-relative State Estimation
Authors: Thomas Jantos, Stephan Weiss and Jan Steinbrener
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
Comments: Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters
  (RA-L)
\\
  Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due
to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific
information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative
navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the
relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's
state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state
estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we
show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor
for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer
perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL
predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing
pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as
a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman
filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the
state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the
dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of
the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance
approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to
underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the
object-relative state estimation task.

  Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods
for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,
assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various
object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.
In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others
manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel
estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic
camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with
a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated
part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To
foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first
ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions
at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera
poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based
baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and
Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

  In augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) experiences, a user's arms and hands
can provide a convenient and tactile surface for touch input. Prior work has
shown on-body input to have significant speed, accuracy, and ergonomic benefits
over in-air interfaces, which are common today. In this work, we demonstrate
high accuracy, bare hands (i.e., no special instrumentation of the user) skin
input using just an RGB camera, like those already integrated into all modern
XR headsets. Our results show this approach can be accurate, and robust across
diverse lighting conditions, skin tones, and body motion (e.g., input while
walking). Finally, our pipeline also provides rich input metadata including
touch force, finger identification, angle of attack, and rotation. We believe
these are the requisite technical ingredients to more fully unlock on-skin
interfaces that have been well motivated in the HCI literature but have lacked
robust and practical methods.

Title: AI-Driven Marine Robotics: Emerging Trends in Underwater Perception and
  Ecosystem Monitoring
Authors: Scarlett Raine and Tobias Fischer
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 9 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the
need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the
rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the
factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a
catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental
necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater
datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from
saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique
underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation
bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental
advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust
perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets,
scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from
passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The
paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of
foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with
methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to
benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

Title: AutoDrive-R$^2$: Incentivizing Reasoning and Self-Reflection Capacity
  for VLA Model in Autonomous Driving
Authors: Zhenlong Yuan, Jing Tang, Jinguo Luo, Rui Chen, Chengxuan Qian, Lei
  Sun, Xiangxiang Chu, Yujun Cai, Dapeng Zhang, Shuo Li
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have
recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal
perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and
coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences
remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose
AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and
self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through
chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K
for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between
input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain
with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and
self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework
that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness
criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive
evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed
method.

  3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) enable controllable facial geometry and
expression editing for reconstruction, animation, and AR/VR, but traditional
PCA-based mesh models are limited in resolution, detail, and photorealism.
Neural volumetric methods improve realism but remain too slow for interactive
use. Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast,
high-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for
expression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry,
expressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head
Gaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry
and appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency
details such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM
provides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters
(e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals
that capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's
capacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders
represent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised
images for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering.
To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first
dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust
disentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across
monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression
transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression
accuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance.

  Analyzing gigapixel images is recognized as computationally demanding. In
this paper, we introduce PyramidAI, a technique for analyzing gigapixel images
with reduced computational cost. The proposed approach adopts a gradual
analysis of the image, beginning with lower resolutions and progressively
concentrating on regions of interest for detailed examination at higher
resolutions. We investigated two strategies for tuning the accuracy-computation
performance trade-off when implementing the adaptive resolution selection,
validated against the Camelyon16 dataset of biomedical images. Our results
demonstrate that PyramidAI substantially decreases the amount of processed data
required for analysis by up to 2.65x, while preserving the accuracy in
identifying relevant sections on a single computer. To ensure democratization
of gigapixel image analysis, we evaluated the potential to use mainstream
computers to perform the computation by exploiting the parallelism potential of
the approach. Using a simulator, we estimated the best data distribution and
load balancing algorithm according to the number of workers. The selected
algorithms were implemented and highlighted the same conclusions in a
real-world setting. Analysis time is reduced from more than an hour to a few
minutes using 12 modest workers, offering a practical solution for efficient
large-scale image analysis.

Categories: cs.GR cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Following rapid advancements in text and image generation, research has
increasingly shifted towards 3D generation. Unlike the well-established
pixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and
fragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids,
neural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees,
each offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this work, we present a
unified evaluation framework designed to assess the performance of 3D
representations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these
representations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency,
and generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our
experiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D
generation pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression
with autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction
errors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to
evaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can
inform the selection of suitable 3D models for various applications,
facilitating the development of more robust and application-specific solutions
in 3D generation. The code for our framework is available at

Title: CERA: A Framework for Improved Generalization of Machine Learning Models
  to Changed Climates
Authors: Shuchang Liu, Paul A. O'Gorman
Categories: physics.ao-ph cs.LG
\\
  Robust generalization under climate change remains a major challenge for
machine learning applications in climate science. Most existing approaches
struggle to extrapolate beyond the climate they were trained on, leading to a
strong dependence on training data from model simulations of warm climates. Use
of climate-invariant inputs improves generalization but requires challenging
manual feature engineering. Here, we present CERA (Climate-invariant Encoding
through Representation Alignment), a machine learning framework consisting of
an autoencoder with explicit latent-space alignment, followed by a predictor
for downstream process estimation. We test CERA on the problem of
parameterizing moist-physics processes. Without training on labeled data from a
+4K climate, CERA leverages labeled control-climate data and unlabeled
warmer-climate inputs to improve generalization to the warmer climate,
outperforming both raw-input and physically informed baselines in predicting
key moisture and energy tendencies. It captures not only the vertical and
meridional structures of the moisture tendencies, but also shifts in the
intensity distribution of precipitation including extremes. Ablation
experiments show that latent alignment improves both accuracy and the
robustness across random seeds used in training. While some reduced skill
remains in the boundary layer, the framework offers a data-driven alternative
to manual feature engineering of climate invariant inputs. Beyond
parameterizations used in hybrid ML-physics systems, the approach holds promise
for other climate applications such as statistical downscaling.

  Sleep apnea, a prevalent sleep disorder, involves repeated episodes of
breathing interruptions during sleep, leading to various health complications,
including cognitive impairments, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke,
and even death. One of the main challenges in diagnosing and treating sleep
apnea is identifying individuals at risk. The current gold standard for
diagnosis, Polysomnography (PSG), is costly, labor intensive, and inconvenient,
often resulting in poor quality sleep data. This paper presents a novel
approach to the detection of sleep apnea using a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained on single channel EEG data. The proposed CNN achieved an accuracy
of 85.1% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.22, demonstrating a
significant potential for home based applications by addressing the limitations
of PSG in automated sleep apnea detection. Key contributions of this work also
include the development of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline with an
Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth filter, a dataset construction
method providing broader temporal context, and the application of SMOTETomek to
address class imbalance. This research underscores the feasibility of
transitioning from traditional laboratory based diagnostics to more accessible,
automated home based solutions, improving patient outcomes and broadening the
accessibility of sleep disorder diagnostics.

  Accurate ocean forecasting is essential for supporting a wide range of marine
applications. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the
potential of data-driven models to outperform traditional numerical approaches,
particularly in atmospheric weather forecasting. However, extending these
methods to ocean systems remains challenging due to their inherently slower
dynamics and complex boundary conditions. In this work, we present MedFormer, a
fully data-driven deep learning model specifically designed for medium-range
ocean forecasting in the Mediterranean Sea. MedFormer is based on a U-Net
architecture augmented with 3D attention mechanisms and operates at a high
horizontal resolution of 1/24{\deg}. The model is trained on 20 years of daily
ocean reanalysis data and fine-tuned with high-resolution operational analyses.
It generates 9-day forecasts using an autoregressive strategy. The model
leverages both historical ocean states and atmospheric forcings, making it
well-suited for operational use. We benchmark MedFormer against the
state-of-the-art Mediterranean Forecasting System (MedFS), developed at
Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC), using both analysis data
and independent observations. The forecast skills, evaluated with the Root Mean
Squared Difference and the Anomaly Correlation Coefficient, indicate that
MedFormer consistently outperforms MedFS across key 3D ocean variables. These
findings underscore the potential of data-driven approaches like MedFormer to
complement, or even surpass, traditional numerical ocean forecasting systems in
both accuracy and computational efficiency.

  Recent advances in neural weather forecasting have shown significant
potential for accurate short-term forecasts. However, adapting such gridded
approaches to smaller, topographically complex regions like Switzerland
introduces computational challenges, especially when aiming for high spatial (1
km) and temporal (10 minutes) resolution. This paper presents a Graph Neural
Network (GNN)-based approach for high-resolution nowcasting in Switzerland
using the Anemoi framework and observational inputs. The proposed model
combines surface observations with selected past and future numerical weather
prediction (NWP) states, enabling an observation-guided interpolation strategy
that enhances short-term accuracy while preserving physical consistency. We
evaluate the method on multiple surface variables and compare it against
operational high-resolution NWP (ICON) and nowcasting (INCA) baselines. The
results show that the GNN model consistently outperforms traditional approaches
in lead times up to 12 hours, especially for wind and precipitation. A
comprehensive verification procedure, including spatial skill scores,
event-based evaluation, and blind tests with professional forecasters,
demonstrates the operational relevance of the approach for mountainous domains.

  Foundation models trained as autoregressive PDE surrogates hold significant
promise for accelerating scientific discovery through their capacity to both
extrapolate beyond training regimes and efficiently adapt to downstream tasks
despite a paucity of examples for fine-tuning. However, reliably achieving
genuine generalization - a necessary capability for producing novel scientific
insights and robustly performing during deployment - remains a critical
challenge. Establishing whether or not these requirements are met demands
evaluation metrics capable of clearly distinguishing genuine model
generalization from mere memorization.
  We apply the influence function formalism to systematically characterize how
autoregressive PDE surrogates assimilate and propagate information derived from
diverse physical scenarios, revealing fundamental limitations of standard
models and training routines in addition to providing actionable insights
regarding the design of improved surrogates.

Title: Migration as a Probe: A Generalizable Benchmark Framework for Specialist
  vs. Generalist Machine-Learned Force Fields in Doped Materials
Authors: Yi Cao, Paulette Clancy
Categories: physics.chem-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.LG physics.comp-ph
\\
  Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), particularly pre-trained foundation
models, promise to bring ab initio-level accuracy to the length and time scales
of molecular dynamics. Yet this shift raises a central question: is it better
to build a specialist model from scratch or adapt a generalist foundation model
for a specific system? The trade-offs in data efficiency, predictive accuracy,
and risks of out-of-distribution (OOD) failure remain unclear. Here, we present
a benchmarking framework that contrasts bespoke (from scratch) and fine-tuned
foundation models in a test case of a technologically relevant 2D material,
Cr-intercalated Sb2Te3, using the MACE architecture. Our framework employs
migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band (NEB) trajectories,
as a diagnostic probe that tests both interpolation and extrapolation. We
assess accuracy for equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical
(interlayer sliding) tasks. While all models capture equilibrium structures,
predictions for non-equilibrium processes diverge. Task-specific fine-tuning
substantially improves kinetic accuracy compared with both from-scratch and
zero-shot models, but can degrade learned representations of long-range
physics. Analysis of internal representations shows that training paradigms
yield distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings of system physics. This work
offers a practical guide for MLFF development, highlights migration-based
probes as efficient diagnostics, and suggests pathways toward uncertainty-aware
active learning strategies.

\\
  Recommender systems continually retrain on user reactions to their own
predictions, creating AI feedback loops that amplify biases and diminish
fairness over time. Despite this well-known risk, most bias mitigation
techniques are tested only on static splits, so their long-term fairness across
multiple retraining rounds remains unclear. We therefore present a systematic
literature review of bias mitigation methods that explicitly consider AI
feedback loops and are validated in multi-round simulations or live A/B tests.
Screening 347 papers yields 24 primary studies published between 2019-2025.
Each study is coded on six dimensions: mitigation technique, biases addressed,
dynamic testing set-up, evaluation focus, application domain, and ML task,
organising them into a reusable taxonomy. The taxonomy offers industry
practitioners a quick checklist for selecting robust methods and gives
researchers a clear roadmap to the field's most urgent gaps. Examples include

Title: Friend or Foe

  A fundamental challenge in microbial ecology is determining whether bacteria
compete or cooperate in different environmental conditions. With recent
advances in genome-scale metabolic models, we are now capable of simulating
interactions between thousands of pairs of bacteria in thousands of different
environmental settings at a scale infeasible experimentally. These approaches
can generate tremendous amounts of data that can be exploited by
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to uncover the mechanisms driving
interactions. Here, we present Friend or Foe, a compendium of 64 tabular
environmental datasets, consisting of more than 26M shared environments for
more than 10K pairs of bacteria sampled from two of the largest collections of
metabolic models. The Friend or Foe datasets are curated for a wide range of
machine learning tasks -- supervised, unsupervised, and generative -- to
address specific questions underlying bacterial interactions. We benchmarked a
selection of the most recent models for each of these tasks and our results
indicate that machine learning can be successful in this application to
microbial ecology. Going beyond, analyses of the Friend or Foe compendium can
shed light on the predictability of bacterial interactions and highlight novel
research directions into how bacteria infer and navigate their relationships.

Title: Playing Markov Games Without Observing Payoffs
Authors: Daniel Ablin and Alon Cohen
Categories: cs.GT cs.LG
\\
  Optimization under uncertainty is a fundamental problem in learning and
decision-making, particularly in multi-agent systems. Previously, Feldman,
Kalai, and Tennenholtz [2010] demonstrated the ability to efficiently compete
in repeated symmetric two-player matrix games without observing payoffs, as
long as the opponents actions are observed. In this paper, we introduce and
formalize a new class of zero-sum symmetric Markov games, which extends the
notion of symmetry from matrix games to the Markovian setting. We show that
even without observing payoffs, a player who knows the transition dynamics and
observes only the opponents sequence of actions can still compete against an
adversary who may have complete knowledge of the game. We formalize three
distinct notions of symmetry in this setting and show that, under these
conditions, the learning problem can be reduced to an instance of online
learning, enabling the player to asymptotically match the return of the
opponent despite lacking payoff observations. Our algorithms apply to both
matrix and Markov games, and run in polynomial time with respect to the size of
the game and the number of episodes. Our work broadens the class of games in
which robust learning is possible under severe informational disadvantage and
deepens the connection between online learning and adversarial game theory.

Title: Newton-Flow Particle Filters based on Generalized Cram\'er Distance
Authors: Uwe D. Hanebeck
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY math.IT
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  We propose a recursive particle filter for high-dimensional problems that
inherently never degenerates. The state estimate is represented by
deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets. We focus on the measurement update
step, where a likelihood function is used for representing the measurement and
its uncertainty. This likelihood is progressively introduced into the filtering
procedure by homotopy continuation over an artificial time. A generalized
Cram\'er distance between particle sets is derived in closed form that is
differentiable and invariant to particle order. A Newton flow then continually
minimizes this distance over artificial time and thus smoothly moves particles
from prior to posterior density. The new filter is surprisingly simple to
implement and very efficient. It just requires a prior particle set and a
likelihood function, never estimates densities from samples, and can be used as
a plugin replacement for classic approaches.

Title: Algorithm Adaptation Bias in Recommendation System Online Experiments
Authors: Chen Zheng, Zhenyu Zhao
Categories: cs.IR cs.LG
\\
  Online experiments (A/B tests) are widely regarded as the gold standard for
evaluating recommender system variants and guiding launch decisions. However, a
variety of biases can distort the results of the experiment and mislead
decision-making. An underexplored but critical bias is algorithm adaptation
effect. This bias arises from the flywheel dynamics among production models,
user data, and training pipelines: new models are evaluated on user data whose
distributions are shaped by the incumbent system or tested only in a small
treatment group. As a result, the measured effect of a new product change in
modeling and user experience in this constrained experimental setting can
diverge substantially from its true impact in full deployment. In practice, the
experiment results often favor the production variant with large traffic while
underestimating the performance of the test variant with small traffic, which
leads to missing opportunities to launch a true winning arm or underestimating
the impact. This paper aims to raise awareness of algorithm adaptation bias,
situate it within the broader landscape of RecSys evaluation biases, and
motivate discussion of solutions that span experiment design, measurement, and
adjustment. We detail the mechanisms of this bias, present empirical evidence
from real-world experiments, and discuss potential methods for a more robust
online evaluation.

\\
  The chromatin folding and the spatial arrangement of chromosomes in the cell
play a crucial role in DNA replication and genes expression. An improper
chromatin folding could lead to malfunctions and, over time, diseases. For
eukaryotes, centromeres are essential for proper chromosome segregation and
folding. Despite extensive research using de novo sequencing of genomes and
annotation analysis, centromere locations in yeasts remain difficult to infer
and are still unknown in most species. Recently, genome-wide chromosome
conformation capture coupled with next-generation sequencing (Hi-C) has become
one of the leading methods to investigate chromosome structures. Some recent
studies have used Hi-C data to give a point estimate of each centromere, but
those approaches highly rely on a good pre-localization. Here, we present a
novel approach that infers in a stochastic manner the locations of all
centromeres in budding yeast based on both the experimental Hi-C map and
simulated contact maps.

\\
  Solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental step
in various scientific and engineering studies. As a classic stochastic solver,
the Walk-on-Spheres (WoS) method is a well-established and efficient algorithm
that provides accurate local estimates for PDEs. In this paper, by integrating
machine learning techniques with WoS and space discretization approaches, we
develop a novel stochastic solver, WoS-NN. This new method solves elliptic
problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions, facilitating precise and rapid
global solutions and gradient approximations. The method inherits excellent
characteristics from the original WoS method, such as being meshless and robust
to irregular regions. By integrating neural networks, WoS-NN also gives instant
local predictions after training without re-sampling, which is especially
suitable for intense requests on a static region. A typical experimental result
demonstrates that the proposed WoS-NN method provides accurate field
estimations, reducing errors by around $75\%$ while using only $8\%$ of path
samples compared to the conventional WoS method, which saves abundant
computational time and resource consumption.

Title: Assessing One-Dimensional Cluster Stability by Extreme-Point Trimming
Authors: Erwan Dereure, Emmanuel Akame Mfoumou and David Holcman

Comments: 33 pages
ACM-class: G.3
\\
  We develop a probabilistic method for assessing the tail behavior and
geometric stability of one-dimensional n i.i.d. samples by tracking how their
span contracts when the most extreme points are trimmed. Central to our
approach is the diameter-shrinkage ratio, that quantifies the relative
reduction in data range as extreme points are successively removed. We derive
analytical expressions, including finite-sample corrections, for the expected
shrinkage under both the uniform and Gaussian hypotheses, and establish that
these curves remain distinct even for moderate number of removal. We construct
an elementary decision rule that assigns a sample to whichever theoretical
shrinkage profile it most closely follows. This test achieves higher
classification accuracy than the classical likelihood-ratio test in
small-sample or noisy regimes, while preserving asymptotic consistency for
large n. We further integrate our criterion into a clustering pipeline (e.g.
DBSCAN), demonstrating its ability to validate one-dimensional clusters without
any density estimation or parameter tuning. This work thus provides both
theoretical insight and practical tools for robust distributional inference and
cluster stability analysis.

Title: The Nondecreasing Rank

Comments: 29 pages, 6 figures
MSC-class: 15-02
\\
  In this article the notion of the nondecreasing (ND) rank of a matrix or
tensor is introduced. A tensor has an ND rank of r if it can be represented as
a sum of r outer products of vectors, with each vector satisfying a
monotonicity constraint. It is shown that for certain poset orderings finding
an ND factorization of rank $r$ is equivalent to finding a nonnegative rank-r
factorization of a transformed tensor. However, not every tensor that is
monotonic has a finite ND rank. Theory is developed describing the properties
of the ND rank, including typical, maximum, and border ND ranks. Highlighted
also are the special settings where a matrix or tensor has an ND rank of one or
two. As a means of finding low ND rank approximations to a data tensor we
introduce a variant of the hierarchical alternating least squares algorithm.
Low ND rank factorizations are found and interpreted for two datasets
concerning the weight of pigs and a mental health survey during the COVID-19
pandemic.

  Data engineering workflows require reliable differencing across files,
databases, and query outputs, yet existing tools falter under schema drift,
heterogeneous types, and limited explainability. SmartDiff is a unified system
that combines schema-aware mapping, type-specific comparators, and parallel
execution. It aligns evolving schemas, compares structured and semi-structured
data (strings, numbers, dates, JSON/XML), and clusters results with labels that
explain how and why differences occur. On multi-million-row datasets, SmartDiff
achieves over 95 percent precision and recall, runs 30 to 40 percent faster,
and uses 30 to 50 percent less memory than baselines; in user studies, it
reduces root-cause analysis time from 10 hours to 12 minutes. An LLM-assisted
labeling pipeline produces deterministic, schema-valid multilabel explanations
using retrieval augmentation and constrained decoding; ablations show further
gains in label accuracy and time to diagnosis over rules-only baselines. These
results indicate SmartDiff's utility for migration validation, regression
testing, compliance auditing, and continuous data quality monitoring. Index

Comments: CoRL 2025. Project website: https://vla-mech-interp.github.io/
\\
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing
generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and
environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far
short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of
kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a
central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where
robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in
mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first
framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal
representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference
time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the
token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed
and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these
findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that
modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or
environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source
VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in
simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that
interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for
control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation
models in robotics.

Title: Solving Optimal Power Flow using a Variational Quantum Approach
Authors: Thinh Viet Le, Mark M. Wilde, and Vassilis Kekatos
Categories: eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY math.OC quant-ph
Comments: 22 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables
\\
  The optimal power flow (OPF) is a large-scale optimization problem that is
central in the operation of electric power systems. Although it can be posed as
a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of
modern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this
context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF.
We encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit
(PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with
a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled
expectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by
minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second
PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients
of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are
updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal
variables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them
to be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system
using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational
quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for
the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with
numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and
training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.

Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures
ACM-class: G.3; J.2
\\
  We introduce a Partial Functional Dynamic Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal
Model (PFD-BDCM), specifically designed for causal inference in the presence of
unmeasured confounders with spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependency. The
proposed PFD-BDCM framework addresses the restrictions of the existing
approaches by uniquely integrating models for complex spatio-temporal dynamics
with the analysis of multi-resolution variables. Specifically, the framework
systematically mitigates confounding bias by integrating valid backdoor
adjustment sets into a diffusion-based sampling mechanism. Moreover, it
accounts for the intricate dynamics of unmeasured confounders through the
deployment of region-specific structural equations and conditional
autoregressive processes, and accommodates variables observed at heterogeneous
resolutions via basis expansions for functional data. Our theoretical analysis
establishes error bounds for counterfactual estimates of PFD-BDCM, formally
linking reconstruction accuracy to counterfactual fidelity under monotonicity
assumptions of structural equation and invertibility assumptions of encoding
function. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets and real-world air
pollution data demonstrate PFD-BDCM's superiority over existing methods.

Title: Game Theoretic Resilience Recommendation Framework for CyberPhysical
  Microgrids Using Hypergraph MetaLearning
Authors: S Krishna Niketh, Prasanta K Panigrahi, V Vignesh, Mayukha Pal
Categories: eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY
\\
  This paper presents a physics-aware cyberphysical resilience framework for
radial microgrids under coordinated cyberattacks. The proposed approach models
the attacker through a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) enhanced with model
agnostic metalearning (MAML) to rapidly adapt to evolving defense strategies
and predict high-impact contingencies. The defender is modeled via a bi-level
Stackelberg game, where the upper level selects optimal tie-line switching and
distributed energy resource (DER) dispatch using an Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) coordinator embedded within the Non-dominated
Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The framework simultaneously optimizes
load served, operational cost, and voltage stability, ensuring all post-defense
states satisfy network physics constraints. The methodology is first validated
on the IEEE 69-bus distribution test system with 12 DERs, 8 critical loads, and
5 tie-lines, and then extended to higher bus systems including the IEEE 123-bus
feeder and a synthetic 300-bus distribution system. Results show that the
proposed defense strategy restores nearly full service for 90% of top-ranked
attacks, mitigates voltage violations, and identifies Feeder 2 as the principal
vulnerability corridor. Actionable operating rules are derived, recommending
pre-arming of specific tie-lines to enhance resilience, while higher bus system
studies confirm scalability of the framework on the IEEE 123-bus and 300-bus
systems.

Title: Identifying Causal Direction via Dense Functional Classes
Authors: Katerina Hlavackova-Schindler, Suzana Marsela
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO
\\
  We address the problem of determining the causal direction between two
univariate, continuous-valued variables, X and Y, under the assumption of no
hidden confounders. In general, it is not possible to make definitive
statements about causality without some assumptions on the underlying model. To
distinguish between cause and effect, we propose a bivariate causal score based
on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, using functions that possess
the density property on a compact real interval. We prove the identifiability
of these causal scores under specific conditions. These conditions can be
easily tested. Gaussianity of the noise in the causal model equations is not
assumed, only that the noise is low. The well-studied class of cubic splines
possesses the density property on a compact real interval. We propose LCUBE as
an instantiation of the MDL-based causal score utilizing cubic regression
splines. LCUBE is an identifiable method that is also interpretable, simple,
and very fast. It has only one hyperparameter. Empirical evaluations compared
to state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that LCUBE achieves superior precision
in terms of AUDRC on the real-world Tuebingen cause-effect pairs dataset. It
also shows superior average precision across common 10 benchmark datasets and
achieves above average precision on 13 datasets.

Comments: Preprint; under double-anonymous review. 6 pages
\\
  Cinematic camera control demands a balance of precision and artistry -
qualities that are difficult to encode through handcrafted reward functions.
While reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to robotic filmmaking, its
reliance on bespoke rewards and extensive tuning limits creative usability. We
propose a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approach using Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to automate dolly-in shots with a
free-roaming, ground-based filming robot. Expert trajectories are collected via
joystick teleoperation in simulation, capturing smooth, expressive motion
without explicit objective design.
  Trained exclusively on these demonstrations, our GAIL policy outperforms a
PPO baseline in simulation, achieving higher rewards, faster convergence, and
lower variance. Crucially, it transfers directly to a real-world robot without
fine-tuning, achieving more consistent framing and subject alignment than a
prior TD3-based method. These results show that LfD offers a robust,
reward-free alternative to RL in cinematic domains, enabling real-time
deployment with minimal technical effort. Our pipeline brings intuitive,
stylized camera control within reach of creative professionals, bridging the
gap between artistic intent and robotic autonomy.

\\
  Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a
pivotal tool for revealing intrinsic brain network connectivity and identifying
neural biomarkers of neuropsychiatric conditions. However, classical
self-attention transformer models--despite their formidable representational
power--struggle with quadratic complexity, large parameter counts, and
substantial data requirements. To address these barriers, we introduce a
Quantum Time-series Transformer, a novel quantum-enhanced transformer
architecture leveraging Linear Combination of Unitaries and Quantum Singular
Value Transformation. Unlike classical transformers, Quantum Time-series
Transformer operates with polylogarithmic computational complexity, markedly
reducing training overhead and enabling robust performance even with fewer
parameters and limited sample sizes. Empirical evaluation on the largest-scale
fMRI datasets from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and the UK
Biobank demonstrates that Quantum Time-series Transformer achieves comparable
or superior predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art classical
transformer models, with especially pronounced gains in small-sample scenarios.
Interpretability analyses using SHapley Additive exPlanations further reveal
that Quantum Time-series Transformer reliably identifies clinically meaningful
neural biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These
findings underscore the promise of quantum-enhanced transformers in advancing
computational neuroscience by more efficiently modeling complex spatio-temporal

  Learning with physical systems is an emerging paradigm that seeks to harness
the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of physical substrates for learning. The
impetus for a paradigm shift in how hardware is used for computational
intelligence stems largely from the unsustainability of artificial neural
network software implemented on conventional transistor-based hardware. This
Perspective highlights one promising approach using physical networks comprised
of resistive memory nanoscale components with dynamically reconfigurable,
self-organising electrical circuitry. Experimental advances have revealed the
non-trivial interactions within these Self-Organising Memristive Networks
(SOMNs), offering insights into their collective nonlinear and adaptive
dynamics, and how these properties can be harnessed for learning using
different hardware implementations. Theoretical approaches, including
mean-field theory, graph theory, and concepts from disordered systems, reveal
deeper insights into the dynamics of SOMNs, especially during transitions
between different conductance states where criticality and other dynamical
phase transitions emerge in both experiments and models. Furthermore, parallels
between adaptive dynamics in SOMNs and plasticity in biological neuronal
networks suggest the potential for realising energy-efficient, brain-like
continual learning. SOMNs thus offer a promising route toward embedded edge
intelligence, unlocking real-time decision-making for autonomous systems,
dynamic sensing, and personalised healthcare, by enabling embedded learning in
resource-constrained environments. The overarching aim of this Perspective is
to show how the convergence of nanotechnology, statistical physics, complex
systems, and self-organising principles offers a unique opportunity to advance
a new generation of physical intelligence technologies.

  The FBMS R package facilitates Bayesian model selection and model averaging
in complex regression settings by employing a variety of Monte Carlo model
exploration methods. At its core, the package implements an efficient Mode
Jumping Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MJMCMC) algorithm, designed to improve mixing
in multi-modal posterior landscapes within Bayesian generalized linear models.
In addition, it provides a genetically modified MJMCMC (GMJMCMC) algorithm that
introduces nonlinear feature generation, thereby enabling the estimation of
Bayesian generalized nonlinear models (BGNLMs). Within this framework, the
algorithm maintains and updates populations of transformed features, computes
their posterior probabilities, and evaluates the posteriors of models
constructed from them. We demonstrate the effective use of FBMS for both
inferential and predictive modeling in Gaussian regression, focusing on
different instances of the BGNLM class of models. Furthermore, through a broad
set of applications, we illustrate how the methodology can be extended to
increasingly complex modeling scenarios, extending to other response
distributions and mixed effect models.

Title: Learning with Mandelbrot and Julia
Authors: V.R. Tjahjono, S.F. Feng, E.R.M. Putri, H. Susanto
Categories: nlin.CD cs.LG
\\
  Recent developments in applied mathematics increasingly employ machine
learning (ML)-particularly supervised learning-to accelerate numerical
computations, such as solving nonlinear partial differential equations. In this
work, we extend such techniques to objects of a more theoretical nature: the
classification and structural analysis of fractal sets. Focusing on the
Mandelbrot and Julia sets as principal examples, we demonstrate that supervised
learning methods-including Classification and Regression Trees (CART),
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Recurrent Neural
Networks using both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM), Random Forests (RF), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-can
classify fractal points with significantly higher predictive accuracy and
substantially lower computational cost than traditional numerical approaches,
such as the thresholding technique. These improvements are consistent across a
range of models and evaluation metrics. Notably, KNN and RF exhibit the best
overall performance, and comparative analyses between models (e.g., KNN vs.
LSTM) suggest the presence of novel regularity properties in these mathematical
structures. Collectively, our findings indicate that ML not only enhances
classification efficiency but also offers promising avenues for generating new
insights, intuitions, and conjectures within pure mathematics.

Title: Beyond Universal Approximation Theorems: Algorithmic Uniform
  Approximation by Neural Networks Trained with Noisy Data

  At its core, machine learning seeks to train models that reliably generalize
beyond noisy observations; however, the theoretical vacuum in which
state-of-the-art universal approximation theorems (UATs) operate isolates them
from this goal, as they assume noiseless data and allow network parameters to
be chosen freely, independent of algorithmic realism. This paper bridges that
gap by introducing an architecture-specific randomized training algorithm that
constructs a uniform approximator from $N$ noisy training samples on the
$d$-dimensional cube $[0,1]^d$. Our trained neural networks attain the
minimax-optimal quantity of \textit{trainable} (non-random) parameters, subject
to logarithmic factors which vanish under the idealized noiseless sampling
assumed in classical UATs.
  Additionally, our trained models replicate key behaviours of real-world
neural networks, absent in standard UAT constructions, by: (1) exhibiting
sub-linear parametric complexity when fine-tuning on structurally related and
favourable out-of-distribution tasks, (2) exactly interpolating the training
data, and (3) maintaining reasonable Lipschitz regularity (after the initial
clustering attention layer). These properties bring state-of-the-art UATs
closer to practical machine learning, shifting the central open question from
algorithmic implementability with noisy samples to whether stochastic gradient
descent can achieve comparable guarantees.

Title: Semi-Supervised Bayesian GANs with Log-Signatures for Uncertainty-Aware
  Credit Card Fraud Detection
Authors: David Hirnschall
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We present a novel deep generative semi-supervised framework for credit card
fraud detection, formulated as time series classification task. As financial
transaction data streams grow in scale and complexity, traditional methods
often require large labeled datasets, struggle with time series of irregular
sampling frequencies and varying sequence lengths. To address these challenges,
we extend conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for targeted data
augmentation, integrate Bayesian inference to obtain predictive distributions
and quantify uncertainty, and leverage log-signatures for robust feature
encoding of transaction histories. We introduce a novel Wasserstein
distance-based loss to align generated and real unlabeled samples while
simultaneously maximizing classification accuracy on labeled data. Our approach
is evaluated on the BankSim dataset, a widely used simulator for credit card
transaction data, under varying proportions of labeled samples, demonstrating
consistent improvements over benchmarks in both global statistical and
domain-specific metrics. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
GAN-driven semi-supervised learning with log-signatures for irregularly sampled
time series and emphasize the importance of uncertainty-aware predictions.

\\
  Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithms are popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods to sample a target probability distribution, which arises in
many applications in machine learning. Inspired by regime-switching stochastic
differential equations in the probability literature, we propose and study
regime-switching Langevin dynamics (RS-LD) and regime-switching kinetic
Langevin dynamics (RS-KLD). Based on their discretizations, we introduce
regime-switching Langevin Monte Carlo (RS-LMC) and regime-switching kinetic
Langevin Monte Carlo (RS-KLMC) algorithms, which can also be viewed as LMC and
KLMC algorithms with random stepsizes. We also propose
frictional-regime-switching kinetic Langevin dynamics (FRS-KLD) and its
associated algorithm frictional-regime-switching kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo
(FRS-KLMC), which can also be viewed as the KLMC algorithm with random
frictional coefficients. We provide their 2-Wasserstein non-asymptotic
convergence guarantees to the target distribution, and analyze the iteration
complexities. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data are
provided to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

  Urban noise pollution poses a significant threat to public health, yet
existing monitoring infrastructures offer limited spatial coverage and
adaptability. This paper presents a scalable, low-cost, IoT-based, real-time
environmental noise monitoring solution using mobile nodes (sensor nodes on a
moving vehicle). The system utilizes a low-cost sound sensor integrated with
GPS-enabled modules to collect geotagged noise data at one-second intervals.
The sound nodes are calibrated against a reference sound level meter in a
laboratory setting to ensure accuracy using various machine learning (ML)
algorithms, such as Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression
(MLR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Segmented Regression (SR), Support Vector
Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). While
laboratory calibration demonstrates high accuracy, it is shown that the
performance of the nodes degrades during data collection in a moving vehicle.
To address this, it is demonstrated that the calibration must be performed on
the IoT-based node based on the data collected in a moving environment along
with the reference device. Among the employed ML models, RFR achieved the best
performance with an R2 of 0.937 and RMSE of 1.09 for mobile calibration. The
system was deployed in Hyderabad, India, through three measurement campaigns
across 27 days, capturing 436,420 data points. Results highlight temporal and
spatial noise variations across weekdays, weekends, and during Diwali.
Incorporating vehicular velocity into the calibration significantly improves
accuracy. The proposed system demonstrates the potential for widespread
deployment of IoT-based noise sensing networks in smart cities, enabling
effective noise pollution management and urban planning.

  This work explores the integration of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and
Quantum-Inspired (QI) techniques for optimizing end-to-end (E2E) network
services in telecommunication systems, particularly focusing on 5G networks and
beyond. The application of QML and QI algorithms is investigated, comparing
their performance with classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches. The present
study employs a hybrid framework combining quantum and classical computing
leveraging the strengths of QML and QI, without the penalty of quantum hardware
availability. This is particularized for the optimization of the Quality of
Experience (QoE) over cellular networks. The framework comprises an estimator
for obtaining the expected QoE based on user metrics, service settings, and
cell configuration, and an optimizer that uses the estimation to choose the
best cell and service configuration. Although the approach is applicable to any
QoE-based network management, its implementation is particularized for the
optimization of network configurations for Cloud Gaming services. Then, it is
evaluated via performance metrics such as accuracy and model loading and
inference times for the estimator, and time to solution and solution score for
the optimizer. The results indicate that QML models achieve similar or superior
accuracy to classical ML models for estimation, while decreasing inference and
loading times. Furthermore, potential for better performance is observed for
higher-dimensional data, highlighting promising results for higher complexity
problems. Thus, the results demonstrate the promising potential of QML in
advancing network optimization, although challenges related to data
availability and integration complexities between quantum and classical ML are
identified as future research lines.

Title: Learning residue level protein dynamics with multiscale Gaussians
Authors: Mihir Bafna, Bowen Jing, and Bonnie Berger
Categories: q-bio.BM cs.LG
\\
  Many methods have been developed to predict static protein structures,
however understanding the dynamics of protein structure is essential for
elucidating biological function. While molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
remain the in silico gold standard, its high computational cost limits
scalability. We present DynaProt, a lightweight, SE(3)-invariant framework that
predicts rich descriptors of protein dynamics directly from static structures.
By casting the problem through the lens of multivariate Gaussians, DynaProt
estimates dynamics at two complementary scales: (1) per-residue marginal
anisotropy as $3 \times 3$ covariance matrices capturing local flexibility, and
(2) joint scalar covariances encoding pairwise dynamic coupling across
residues. From these dynamics outputs, DynaProt achieves high accuracy in
predicting residue-level flexibility (RMSF) and, remarkably, enables reasonable
reconstruction of the full covariance matrix for fast ensemble generation.
Notably, it does so using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than prior
methods. Our results highlight the potential of direct protein dynamics
prediction as a scalable alternative to existing methods.

Title: Detecting Rug Pulls in Decentralized Exchanges: Machine Learning

Categories: cs.DC cs.LG
\\
  This paper presents a machine learning framework for the early detection of
rug pull scams on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) within The Open Network (TON)
blockchain. TON's unique architecture, characterized by asynchronous execution
and a massive web2 user base from Telegram, presents a novel and critical
environment for fraud analysis. We conduct a comprehensive study on the two
largest TON DEXs, Ston.Fi and DeDust, fusing data from both platforms to train
our models. A key contribution is the implementation and comparative analysis
of two distinct rug pull definitions--TVL-based (a catastrophic liquidity
withdrawal) and idle-based (a sudden cessation of all trading activity)--within
a single, unified study. We demonstrate that Gradient Boosting models can
effectively identify rug pulls within the first five minutes of trading, with
the TVL-based method achieving superior AUC (up to 0.891) while the idle-based
method excels at recall. Our analysis reveals that while feature sets are
consistent across exchanges, their underlying distributions differ
significantly, challenging straightforward data fusion and highlighting the
need for robust, platform-aware models. This work provides a crucial
early-warning mechanism for investors and enhances the security infrastructure
of the rapidly growing TON DeFi ecosystem.

Title: RAMS: Residual-based adversarial-gradient moving sample method for
  scientific machine learning in solving partial differential equations
Authors: Weihang Ouyang, Min Zhu, Wei Xiong, Si-Wei Liu, and Lu Lu
Categories: cs.CE cs.LG physics.comp-ph
\\
  Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators, two leading
scientific machine learning (SciML) paradigms, have emerged as powerful tools
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Although increasing the
training sample size generally enhances network performance, it also increases
computational costs for physics-informed or data-driven training. To address
this trade-off, different sampling strategies have been developed to sample
more points in regions with high PDE residuals. However, existing sampling
methods are computationally demanding for high-dimensional problems, such as
high-dimensional PDEs or operator learning tasks. Here, we propose a
residual-based adversarial-gradient moving sample (RAMS) method, which moves
samples according to the adversarial gradient direction to maximize the PDE
residual via gradient-based optimization. RAMS can be easily integrated into
existing sampling methods. Extensive experiments, ranging from PINN applied to
high-dimensional PDEs to physics-informed and data-driven operator learning
problems, have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of RAMS.
Notably, RAMS represents the first efficient adaptive sampling approach for
operator learning, marking a significant advancement in the SciML field.

  In contemporary cloud-based services, protecting users' sensitive data and
ensuring the confidentiality of the server's model are critical. Fully
homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables inference directly on encrypted inputs,
but its practicality is hindered by expensive bootstrapping and inefficient
approximations of non-linear activations. We introduce Safhire, a hybrid
inference framework that executes linear layers under encryption on the server
while offloading non-linearities to the client in plaintext. This design
eliminates bootstrapping, supports exact activations, and significantly reduces
computation. To safeguard model confidentiality despite client access to
intermediate outputs, Safhire applies randomized shuffling, which obfuscates
intermediate values and makes it practically impossible to reconstruct the
model. To further reduce latency, Safhire incorporates advanced optimizations
such as fast ciphertext packing and partial extraction. Evaluations on multiple
standard models and datasets show that Safhire achieves 1.5X - 10.5X lower
inference latency than Orion, a state-of-the-art baseline, with manageable
communication overhead and comparable accuracy, thereby establishing the
practicality of hybrid FHE inference.

  Retrieval

Categories: cs.IR cs.LG
\\
  Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) is a critical yet unresolved task for
modern search systems, retrieving documents that not only satisfy a query's
information need but also adhere to its temporal constraints. This task is
shaped by two challenges: Relevance, ensuring alignment with the query's
explicit temporal requirements, and Recency, selecting the freshest document
among multiple versions. Existing methods often address the two challenges in
isolation, relying on brittle heuristics that fail in scenarios where temporal
requirements and staleness resistance are intertwined. To address this gap, we
introduce Re2Bench, a benchmark specifically designed to disentangle and
evaluate Relevance, Recency, and their hybrid combination. Building on this
foundation, we propose Re3, a unified and lightweight framework that
dynamically balances semantic and temporal information through a query-aware
gating mechanism. On Re2Bench, Re3 achieves state-of-the-art results, leading
in R@1 across all three subsets. Ablation studies with backbone sensitivity
tests confirm robustness, showing strong generalization across diverse encoders
and real-world settings. This work provides both a generalizable solution and a
principled evaluation suite, advancing the development of temporally aware
retrieval systems. Re3 and Re2Bench are available online:

  multilayer neural networks

Categories: cond-mat.dis-nn cs.LG hep-lat
Comments: 27 pages, many figures
\\
  Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the
convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the
optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be
obtained by studying a neural network's phase diagram, in which each phase is
characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight
matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the
observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean
squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where
the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial
variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder,
and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size.
As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics
of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation
for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian
motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified
effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of
the optimiser.

\\
  Weather forecasting plays a crucial role in supporting strategic decisions
across various sectors, including agriculture, renewable energy production, and
disaster management. However, the inherently dynamic and chaotic behavior of
the atmosphere presents significant challenges to conventional predictive
models. On the other hand, introducing quantum computing simulation techniques
to the forecasting problems constitutes a promising alternative to overcome
these challenges. In this context, this work explores the emerging intersection
between quantum machine learning (QML) and climate forecasting. We present the
implementation of a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) trained on real meteorological
data from NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) database. The
results show that QNN has the potential to outperform a classical Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) in terms of accuracy and adaptability to abrupt data
shifts, particularly in wind speed prediction. Despite observed nonlinearities
and architectural sensitivities, the QNN demonstrated robustness in handling
temporal variability and faster convergence in temperature prediction. These
findings highlight the potential of quantum models in short and medium term
climate prediction, while also revealing key challenges and future directions
for optimization and broader applicability.

Title: Hierarchical Maximum Entropy via the Renormalization Group
Authors: Amir R. Asadi
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
Comments: 20 pages
\\
  Hierarchical structures, which include multiple levels, are prevalent in
statistical and machine-learning models as well as physical systems. Extending
the foundational result that the maximum entropy distribution under mean
constraints is given by the exponential Gibbs-Boltzmann form, we introduce the
framework of "hierarchical maximum entropy" to address these multilevel models.
We demonstrate that Pareto optimal distributions, which maximize entropies
across all levels of hierarchical transformations, can be obtained via
renormalization-group procedures from theoretical physics. This is achieved by
formulating multilevel extensions of the Gibbs variational principle and the
Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of entropy. Moreover, we explore
settings with hierarchical invariances that significantly simplify the
renormalization-group procedures, enhancing computational efficiency: quadratic
modular loss functions, logarithmic loss functions, and nearest-neighbor loss
functions. This is accomplished through the introduction of the concept of
parameter flows, which serves as an analog to renormalization flows in
renormalization group theory. This work connects ideas from probability theory,
information theory, and statistical mechanics.

Title: Temporal Representation Learning for Real-Time Ultrasound Analysis
Authors: Yves Stebler, Thomas M. Sutter, Ece Ozkan, Julia E. Vogt
Categories: eess.IV cs.LG
Comments: ICMl 2025 Workshop
\\
  Ultrasound (US) imaging is a critical tool in medical diagnostics, offering
real-time visualization of physiological processes. One of its major advantages
is its ability to capture temporal dynamics, which is essential for assessing
motion patterns in applications such as cardiac monitoring, fetal development,
and vascular imaging. Despite its importance, current deep learning models
often overlook the temporal continuity of ultrasound sequences, analyzing
frames independently and missing key temporal dependencies. To address this
gap, we propose a method for learning effective temporal representations from
ultrasound videos, with a focus on echocardiography-based ejection fraction
(EF) estimation. EF prediction serves as an ideal case study to demonstrate the
necessity of temporal learning, as it requires capturing the rhythmic
contraction and relaxation of the heart. Our approach leverages temporally

Title: Sampling as Bandits: Evaluation-Efficient Design for Black-Box Densities
Authors: Takuo Matsubara, Andrew Duncan, Simon Cotter, Konstantinos Zygalakis
Categories: stat.ME cs.LG stat.CO stat.ML
\\
  We introduce bandit importance sampling (BIS), a new class of importance
sampling methods designed for settings where the target density is expensive to
evaluate. In contrast to adaptive importance sampling, which optimises a
proposal distribution, BIS directly designs the samples through a sequential
strategy that combines space-filling designs with multi-armed bandits. Our
method leverages Gaussian process surrogates to guide sample selection,
enabling efficient exploration of the parameter space with minimal target
evaluations. We establish theoretical guarantees on convergence and demonstrate
the effectiveness of the method across a broad range of sampling tasks. BIS
delivers accurate approximations with fewer target evaluations, outperforming
competing approaches across multimodal, heavy-tailed distributions, and
real-world applications to Bayesian inference of computationally expensive
models.

  In this work, we present a fast and effective Linear approach for updating
recommendations in a scalable graph-based recommender system UltraGCN. Solving
this task is extremely important to maintain the relevance of the
recommendations under the conditions of a large amount of new data and changing
user preferences. To address this issue, we adapt the simple yet effective
low-rank approximation approach to the graph-based model. Our method delivers
instantaneous recommendations that are up to 30 times faster than conventional
methods, with gains in recommendation quality, and demonstrates high
scalability even on the large catalogue datasets.

Title: Lipschitz-Guided Design of Interpolation Schedules in Generative Models
Authors: Yifan Chen, Eric Vanden-Eijnden, Jiawei Xu
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG cs.NA math.NA
\\
  We study the design of interpolation schedules in the stochastic interpolants
framework for flow and diffusion-based generative models. We show that while
all scalar interpolation schedules achieve identical statistical efficiency
under Kullback-Leibler divergence in path space after optimal diffusion
coefficient tuning, their numerical efficiency can differ substantially. This
observation motivates focusing on numerical properties of the resulting drift
fields rather than statistical criteria for schedule design. We propose
averaged squared Lipschitzness minimization as a principled criterion for
numerical optimization, providing an alternative to kinetic energy minimization
used in optimal transport approaches. A transfer formula is derived that
enables conversion between different schedules at inference time without
retraining neural networks. For Gaussian distributions, our optimized schedules
achieve exponential improvements in Lipschitz constants over standard linear
schedules, while for Gaussian mixtures, they reduce mode collapse in few-step
sampling. We also validate our approach on high-dimensional invariant
distributions from stochastic Allen-Cahn equations and Navier-Stokes equations,
demonstrating robust performance improvements across resolutions.

Title: Preconditioned Regularized Wasserstein Proximal Sampling
Authors: Hong Ye Tan, Stanley Osher, Wuchen Li
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.OC stat.CO
MSC-class: 65C05, 62G07
\\
  We consider sampling from a Gibbs distribution by evolving finitely many
particles. We propose a preconditioned version of a recently proposed
noise-free sampling method, governed by approximating the score function with
the numerically tractable score of a regularized Wasserstein proximal operator.
This is derived by a Cole--Hopf transformation on coupled anisotropic heat
equations, yielding a kernel formulation for the preconditioned regularized
Wasserstein proximal. The diffusion component of the proposed method is also
interpreted as a modified self-attention block, as in transformer
architectures. For quadratic potentials, we provide a discrete-time
non-asymptotic convergence analysis and explicitly characterize the bias, which
is dependent on regularization and independent of step-size. Experiments
demonstrate acceleration and particle-level stability on various log-concave
and non-log-concave toy examples to Bayesian total-variation regularized image
deconvolution, and competitive/better performance on non-convex Bayesian neural
network training when utilizing variable preconditioning matrices.

Title: Learning to Ask: Decision Transformers for Adaptive Quantitative Group
  Testing
Authors: Mahdi Soleymani, Tara Javidi
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
\\
  We consider the problem of quantitative group testing (QGT), where the goal
is to recover a sparse binary vector from aggregate subset-sum queries: each
query selects a subset of indices and returns the sum of those entries.
Information-theoretic results suggest that adaptivity could yield up to a
twofold reduction in the total number of required queries, yet no algorithm has
surpassed the non-adaptive bound, leaving its practical benefit an open
question. In this paper, we reduce the QGT problem to an integer-vector
recovery task whose dimension scales with the sparsity of the original problem
rather than its full ambient size. We then formulate this reduced recovery task
as an offline reinforcement learning problem and employ Decision Transformers
to solve it adaptively. By combining these two steps, we obtain an effective
end-to-end method for solving the QGT problem. Our experiments show that, for
the first time in the literature, our adaptive algorithm reduces the average
number of queries below the well-known non-adaptive information-theoretic
bound, demonstrating that adaptivity can indeed reduce the number of queries.

Title: Constrained Decoding for Robotics Foundation Models
Authors: Parv Kapoor, Akila Ganlath, Changliu Liu, Sebastian Scherer, Eunsuk
  Kang
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG cs.LO
\\
  Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to
promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These
models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-
modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then
executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the
perspective of im- proved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are
still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral
correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing
a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces
logical constraints on action trajec- tories in dynamical systems. Our method
ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the
underlying foundation model. We perform com- prehensive evaluation of our
approach across state-of-the-art navigation founda- tion models and we show
that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe
actions but also for conditional action-generation. Videos available on our

\\
  Generative modeling of high-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) offers a data-driven route to simulations, anomaly detection, among other
applications. A central challenge lies in the hybrid nature of particle-cloud
data: each particle carries continuous kinematic features and discrete quantum
numbers such as charge and flavor. We introduce a transformer-based multimodal
flow that extends flow-matching with a continuous-time Markov jump bridge to
jointly model LHC jets with both modalities. Trained on CMS Open Data, our
model can generate high fidelity jets with realistic kinematics, jet
substructure and flavor composition.

  This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine learning methodologies
for automatic music genre classification. We evaluate the performance of
classical classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ensemble
methods, trained on a comprehensive set of hand-crafted audio features, against
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on Mel spectrograms. The study
is conducted on the widely-used GTZAN dataset. Our findings demonstrate a
noteworthy result: the SVM, leveraging domain-specific feature engineering,
achieves superior classification accuracy compared to the end-to-end CNN model.
We attribute this outcome to the data-constrained nature of the benchmark
dataset, where the strong inductive bias of engineered features provides a
regularization effect that mitigates the risk of overfitting inherent in
high-capacity deep learning models. This work underscores the enduring
relevance of traditional feature extraction in practical audio processing tasks
and provides a critical perspective on the universal applicability of deep
learning, especially for moderately sized datasets.

Categories: math.RA cs.LG
\\
  In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that heals corrupted finite
semigroups, combining deterministic repair strategies with Machine Learning
using a Random Forest Classifier. Corruption in these tables breaks
associativity and invalidates the algebraic structure. Deterministic methods
work for small cardinality n and low corruption but degrade rapidly. Our
experiments, carried out on Mace4-generated data sets, demonstrate that our
hybrid framework achieves higher healing rates than deterministic-only and
ML-only baselines. At a corruption percentage of p=15%, our framework healed
95% of semigroups up to cardinality n=6 and 60% at n=10.

Title: Wrong Model, Right Uncertainty: Spatial Associations for Discrete Data
  with Misspecification
Authors: David R. Burt, Renato Berlinghieri and Tamara Broderick
Categories: stat.ME cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 24 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Scientists are often interested in estimating an association between a
covariate and a binary- or count-valued response. For instance, public health
officials are interested in how much disease presence (a binary response per
individual) varies as temperature or pollution (covariates) increases. Many
existing methods can be used to estimate associations, and corresponding
uncertainty intervals, but make unrealistic assumptions in the spatial domain.
For instance, they incorrectly assume models are well-specified. Or they assume
the training and target locations are i.i.d. -- whereas in practice, these
locations are often not even randomly sampled. Some recent work avoids these
assumptions but works only for continuous responses with spatially constant
noise. In the present work, we provide the first confidence intervals with
guaranteed asymptotic nominal coverage for spatial associations given discrete
responses, even under simultaneous model misspecification and nonrandom
sampling of spatial locations. To do so, we demonstrate how to handle spatially
varying noise, provide a novel proof of consistency for our proposed estimator,
and use a delta method argument with a Lyapunov central limit theorem. We show
empirically that standard approaches can produce unreliable confidence
intervals and can even get the sign of an association wrong, while our method
reliably provides correct coverage.

Categories: physics.optics cs.LG
\\
  Quantum optical neurons (QONs) are emerging as promising computational units
that leverage photonic interference to perform neural operations in an
energy-efficient and physically grounded manner. Building on recent theoretical
proposals, we introduce a family of QON architectures based on Hong-Ou-Mandel
(HOM) and Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometers, incorporating different photon
modulation strategies -- phase, amplitude, and intensity. These physical setups
yield distinct pre-activation functions, which we implement as fully
differentiable modules in software. We evaluate these QONs both in isolation
and as building blocks of multilayer networks, training them on binary and
multiclass image classification tasks using the MNIST and FashionMNIST
datasets. Our experiments show that two configurations -- HOM-based amplitude
modulation and MZ-based phase-shifted modulation -- achieve performance
comparable to that of classical neurons in several settings, and in some cases
exhibit faster or more stable convergence. In contrast, intensity-based
encodings display greater sensitivity to distributional shifts and training
instabilities. These results highlight the potential of QONs as efficient and
scalable components for future quantum-inspired neural architectures and hybrid
photonic-electronic systems.

  Machine learning has recently been adopted to emulate sensitivity matrices
for real-time magnetic control of tokamak plasmas. However, these approaches
would benefit from a quantification of possible inaccuracies. We report on two
aspects of real-time applicability of emulators. First, we quantify the
agreement of target displacement from VCs computed via Jacobians of the shape
emulators with those from finite differences Jacobians on exact Grad-Shafranov
solutions. Good agreement ($\approx$5-10%) can be achieved on a selection of
geometric targets using combinations of neural network emulators with
$\approx10^5$ parameters. A sample of $\approx10^{5}-10^{6}$ synthetic
equilibria is essential to train emulators that are not over-regularised or
overfitting. Smaller models trained on the shape targets may be further
fine-tuned to better fit the Jacobians. Second, we address the effect of vessel
currents that are not directly measured in real-time and are typically subsumed
into effective "shaping currents" when designing virtual circuits. We
demonstrate that shaping currents can be inferred via simple linear regression
on a trailing window of active coil current measurements with residuals of only
a few Amp\`eres, enabling a choice for the most appropriate shaping currents at
any point in a shot. While these results are based on historic shot data and
simulations tailored to MAST-U, they indicate that emulators with
few-millisecond latency can be developed for robust real-time plasma shape
control in existing and upcoming tokamaks.

\\
  Reservoir computing (RC) is a state-of-the-art machine learning method that
makes use of the power of dynamical systems (the reservoir) for real-time
inference. When using biological complex systems as reservoir substrates, it
serves as a testbed for basic questions about bio-inspired computation -- of
how self-organization generates proper spatiotemporal patterning. Here, we use
a simulation of an active matter system, driven by a chaotically moving input
signal, as a reservoir. So far, it has been unclear whether such complex
systems possess the capacity to process information efficiently and
independently of the method by which it was introduced. We find that when
switching from a repulsive to an attractive driving force, the system
completely changes the way it computes, while the predictive performance
landscapes remain nearly identical. The nonlinearity of the driver's injection
force improves computation by decoupling the single-agent dynamics from that of
the driver. Triggered are the (re-)growth, deformation, and active motion of
smooth structural boundaries (interfaces), and the emergence of coherent
gradients in speed -- features found in many soft materials and biological
systems. The nonlinear driving force activates emergent regulatory mechanisms,
which manifest enhanced morphological and dynamic diversity -- arguably
improving fading memory, nonlinearity, expressivity, and thus, performance. We
further perform RC in a broad variety of non-equilibrium active matter phases
that arise when tuning internal (repulsive) forces for information transfer.
Overall, we find that active matter agents forming liquid droplets are
particularly well suited for RC. The consistently convex shape of the
predictive performance landscapes, together with the observed phenomenological
richness, conveys robustness and adaptivity.

Title: The Price of Sparsity: Sufficient Conditions for Sparse Recovery using
  Sparse and Sparsified Measurements
Authors: Youssef Chaabouni, David Gamarnik
Categories: stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT math.ST stat.TH
\\
  We consider the problem of recovering the support of a sparse signal using
noisy projections. While extensive work has been done on the dense measurement
matrix setting, the sparse setting remains less explored. In this work, we
establish sufficient conditions on the sample size for successful sparse
recovery using sparse measurement matrices. Bringing together our result with
previously known necessary conditions, we discover that, in the regime where
$ds/p \rightarrow +\infty$, sparse recovery in the sparse setting exhibits a
phase transition at an information-theoretic threshold of
$n_{\text{INF}}^{\text{SP}} =
\Theta\left(s\log\left(p/s\right)/\log\left(ds/p\right)\right)$, where $p$
denotes the signal dimension, $s$ the number of non-zero components of the
signal, and $d$ the expected number of non-zero components per row of
measurement. This expression makes the price of sparsity explicit: restricting
each measurement to $d$ non-zeros inflates the required sample size by a factor
of $\log{s}/\log\left(ds/p\right)$, revealing a precise trade-off between
sampling complexity and measurement sparsity. Additionally, we examine the
effect of sparsifying an originally dense measurement matrix on sparse signal
recovery. We prove in the regime of $s = \alpha p$ and $d = \psi p$ with
$\alpha, \psi \in \left(0,1\right)$ and $\psi$ small that a sample of size
$n^{\text{Sp-ified}}_{\text{INF}} = \Theta\left(p / \psi^2\right)$ is
sufficient for recovery, subject to a certain uniform integrability conjecture,
the proof of which is work in progress.

Title: QUBO-based training for VQAs on Quantum Annealers
Authors: Ernesto Acosta, Guillermo Botella and Carlos Cano
Categories: quant-ph cs.LG
Comments: 33 pages, 4 appendix, 14 images
\\
  Quantum annealers provide an effective framework for solving large-scale
combinatorial optimization problems. This work presents a novel methodology for
training Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) by reformulating the parameter
optimization task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
problem. Unlike traditional gradient-based methods, our approach directly
leverages the Hamiltonian of the chosen VQA ansatz and employs an adaptive,
metaheuristic optimization scheme. This optimization strategy provides a rich
set of configurable parameters which enables the adaptation to specific problem
characteristics and available computational resources. The proposed framework
is generalizable to arbitrary Hamiltonians and integrates a recursive
refinement strategy to progressively approximate high-quality solutions.
  Experimental evaluations demonstrate the feasibility of the method and its
ability to significantly reduce computational overhead compared to classical
and evolutionary optimizers, while achieving comparable or superior solution
quality. These findings suggest that quantum annealers can serve as a scalable
alternative to classical optimizers for VQA training, particularly in scenarios
affected by barren plateaus and noisy gradient estimates, and open new
possibilities for hybrid quantum gate - quantum annealing - classical
optimization models in near-term quantum computing.

Title: RadioDiff-Loc: Diffusion Model Enhanced Scattering Congnition for NLoS
  Localization with Sparse Radio Map Estimation
Authors: Xiucheng Wang and Qiming Zhang and Nan Cheng
Categories: eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY
\\
  Accurate localization of non-cooperative signal sources in non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) environments remains a critical challenge with a wide range of
applications, including autonomous navigation, industrial automation, and
emergency response. In such settings, traditional positioning techniques
relying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe
multipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel
generative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional
diffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted
electromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling
strategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at
the geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information
and mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack
of known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to
the maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant
radio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the
full RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization
is then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM.
Moreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based
localization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical
knowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy. Extensive
theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that our approach
achieves high localization accuracy with significantly reduced sampling cost,
offering a scalable and physically grounded solution for non-cooperative NLoS
emitter localization.

  Seven state-of-the-art AI weather models (FourCastNet, FourCastNet-SFNO,
Pangu-Weather, GraphCast, Aurora, AIFS, and GenCast) are evaluated against
observational data during the South Asian Monsoon. The models are tested on
temperature, winds, global kinetic energy spectrum, regional precipitation,
cloud cover, cyclone trajectory prediction, and hyperlocal predictions around
extreme weather events. The models forecast large-scale dynamics with
reasonable accuracy, but fall short on key metrics critical to Monsoon-time
weather prediction. The models exhibit substantially higher errors when
compared against ground-based weather station data than against reanalysis or
conventional forecasts. The AI weather prediction models show key differences
in mesoscale kinetic energy and extreme precipitation during the Monsoon, and
predict markedly different Monsoon-time cyclone trajectories over the Indian
subcontinent, raising questions about their readiness for operational
applications. Our analysis finds that ECMWF's deterministic AIFS model offers
the most reliable performance and usability, with GraphCast and GenCast being
close seconds.

Title: Design of Experiment for Discovering Directed Mixed Graph
Authors: Haijie Xu, Chen Zhang
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We study the problem of experimental design for accurately identifying the
causal graph structure of a simple structural causal model (SCM), where the
underlying graph may include both cycles and bidirected edges induced by latent
confounders. The presence of cycles renders it impossible to recover the graph
skeleton using observational data alone, while confounding can further
invalidate traditional conditional independence (CI) tests in certain
scenarios. To address these challenges, we establish lower bounds on both the
maximum number of variables that can be intervened upon in a single experiment
and the total number of experiments required to identify all directed edges and
non-adjacent bidirected edges. Leveraging both CI tests and do see tests, and
accounting for $d$ separation and $\sigma$ separation, we develop two classes
of algorithms, i.e., bounded and unbounded, that can recover all causal edges
except for double adjacent bidirected edges. We further show that, up to
logarithmic factors, the proposed algorithms are tight with respect to the
derived lower bounds.

Title: Non-Linear Model-Based Sequential Decision-Making in Agriculture
Authors: Sakshi Arya and Wentao Lin
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.AP stat.ME
MSC-class: 62P12, 91B06
\\
  Sequential decision-making is central to sustainable agricultural management
and precision agriculture, where resource inputs must be optimized under
uncertainty and over time. However, such decisions must often be made with
limited observations, whereas classical bandit and reinforcement learning
approaches typically rely on either linear or black-box reward models that may
misrepresent domain knowledge or require large amounts of data. We propose a
family of nonlinear, model-based bandit algorithms that embed domain-specific
response curves directly into the exploration-exploitation loop. By coupling
(i) principled uncertainty quantification with (ii) closed-form or rapidly
computable profit optima, these algorithms achieve sublinear regret and
near-optimal sample complexity while preserving interpretability. Theoretical
analysis establishes regret and sample complexity bounds, and extensive
simulations emulating real-world fertilizer-rate decisions show consistent
improvements over both linear and nonparametric baselines (such as linear UCB
and $k$-NN UCB) in the low-sample regime, under both well-specified and
shape-compatible misspecified models. Because our approach leverages
mechanistic insight rather than large data volumes, it is especially suited to
resource-constrained settings, supporting sustainable, inclusive, and
transparent sequential decision-making across agriculture, environmental

Title: Entry Barriers in Content Markets
Authors: Haiqing Zhu, Lexing Xie and Yun Kuen Cheung
Categories: cs.GT cs.LG
\\
  The prevalence of low-quality content on online platforms is often attributed
to the absence of meaningful entry requirements. This motivates us to
investigate whether implicit or explicit entry barriers, alongside appropriate
reward mechanisms, can enhance content quality. We present the first
game-theoretic analysis of two distinct types of entry barriers in online
content platforms. The first, a structural barrier, emerges from the collective
behaviour of incumbent content providers which disadvantages new entrants. We
show that both rank-order and proportional-share reward mechanisms induce such
a structural barrier at Nash equilibrium. The second, a strategic barrier,
involves the platform proactively imposing entry fees to discourage
participation from low-quality contributors. We consider a scheme in which the
platform redirects some or all of the entry fees into the reward pool. We
formally demonstrate that this approach can improve overall content quality.
Our findings establish a theoretical foundation for designing reward mechanisms
coupled with entry fees to promote higher-quality content and support healthier
online ecosystems.

Title: Computational Fluid Dynamics Optimization of F1 Front Wing using Physics
  Informed Neural Networks
Authors: Naval Shah
Categories: cs.CE cs.LG
Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures
\\
  In response to recent FIA regulations reducing Formula 1 team wind tunnel
hours (from 320 hours for last-place teams to 200 hours for championship
leaders) and strict budget caps of 135 million USD per year, more efficient
aerodynamic development tools are needed by teams. Conventional computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, though offering high fidelity results,
require large computational resources with typical simulation durations of 8-24
hours per configuration analysis. This article proposes a Physics-Informed
Neural Network (PINN) for the fast prediction of Formula 1 front wing
aerodynamic coefficients. The suggested methodology combines CFD simulation
data from SimScale with first principles of fluid dynamics through a hybrid
loss function that constrains both data fidelity and physical adherence based
on Navier-Stokes equations. Training on force and moment data from 12
aerodynamic features, the PINN model records coefficient of determination
(R-squared) values of 0.968 for drag coefficient and 0.981 for lift coefficient
prediction while lowering computational time. The physics-informed framework
guarantees that predictions remain adherent to fundamental aerodynamic
principles, offering F1 teams an efficient tool for the fast exploration of
design space within regulatory constraints.

Title: Morphology-Specific Peptide Discovery via Masked Conditional Generative
  Modeling
Authors: Nuno Costa, Julija Zavadlav
Categories: q-bio.BM cs.LG
Comments: 17 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Peptide self-assembly prediction offers a powerful bottom-up strategy for
designing biocompatible, low-toxicity materials for large-scale synthesis in a
broad range of biomedical and energy applications. However, screening the vast
sequence space for categorization of aggregate morphology remains intractable.
We introduce PepMorph, an end-to-end peptide discovery pipeline that generates
novel sequences that are not only prone to aggregate but self-assemble into a
specified fibrillar or spherical morphology. We compiled a new dataset by
leveraging existing aggregation propensity datasets and extracting geometric
and physicochemical isolated peptide descriptors that act as proxies for
aggregate morphology. This dataset is then used to train a Transformer-based
Conditional Variational Autoencoder with a masking mechanism, which generates
novel peptides under arbitrary conditioning. After filtering to ensure design
specifications and validation of generated sequences through coarse-grained
molecular dynamics simulations, PepMorph yielded 83% accuracy in intended
morphology generation, showcasing its promise as a framework for
application-driven peptide discovery.

\\
  Stochastic processes on graphs are a powerful tool for modelling complex
dynamical systems such as epidemics. A recent line of work focused on the
inference problem where one aims to estimate the state of every node at every
time, starting from partial observation of a subset of nodes at a subset of
times. In these works, the initial state of the process was assumed to be
random i.i.d. over nodes. Such an assumption may not be realistic in practice,
where one may have access to a set of covariate variables for every node that
influence the initial state of the system. In this work, we will assume that
the initial state of a node is an unknown function of such covariate variables.
Given that functions can be represented by neural networks, we will study a
model where the initial state is given by a simple neural network -- notably
the single-layer perceptron acting on the known node-wise covariate variables.
  Within a Bayesian framework, we study how such neural-network prior
information enhances the recovery of initial states and spreading trajectories.
We derive a hybrid belief propagation and approximate message passing (BP-AMP)
algorithm that handles both the spreading dynamics and the information included
in the node covariates, and we assess its performance against the estimators
that either use only the spreading information or use only the information from
the covariate variables.
  We show that in some regimes, the model can exhibit first-order phase
transitions when using a Rademacher distribution for the neural-network
weights. These transitions create a statistical-to-computational gap where even
the BP-AMP algorithm, despite the theoretical possibility of perfect recovery,
fails to achieve it.

Title: Online Complexity Estimation for Repetitive Scenario Design
Authors: Guillaume O. Berger, Rapha\"el M. Jungers
Categories: math.OC cs.LG
\\
  We consider the problem of repetitive scenario design where one has to solve
repeatedly a scenario design problem and can adjust the sample size (number of
scenarios) to obtain a desired level of risk (constraint violation
probability). We propose an approach to learn on the fly the optimal sample
size based on observed data consisting in previous scenario solutions and their
risk level. Our approach consists in learning a function that represents the
pdf (probability density function) of the risk as a function of the sample
size. Once this function is known, retrieving the optimal sample size is
straightforward. We prove the soundness and convergence of our approach to
obtain the optimal sample size for the class of fixed-complexity scenario
problems, which generalizes fully-supported convex scenario programs that have
been studied extensively in the scenario optimization literature. We also
demonstrate the practical efficiency of our approach on a series of challenging
repetitive scenario design problems, including non-fixed-complexity problems,
nonconvex constraints and time-varying distributions.

Title: Using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) as a diagnostic tool: An
  application for deducing hydrologic connectivity at watershed scale
Authors: Sheng Ye, Jiyu Li, Yifan Chai, Lin Liu, Murugesu Sivapalan, Qihua Ran
Categories: physics.geo-ph cs.LG
Comments: 29 pages, 12 figures
\\
  Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been applied to
interpret deep learning model results. However, applications that integrate XAI
with established hydrologic knowledge for process understanding remain limited.
Here we present a framework that apply XAI method at point-scale to provide
granular interpretation and enable cross-scale aggregation of hydrologic
responses. Hydrologic connectivity is used as a demonstration of the value of
this approach. Soil moisture and its movement generated by physically based
hydrologic model were used to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network,
whose impacts of inputs were evaluated by XAI methods. Our results suggest that
XAI-based classification can effectively identify the differences in the
functional roles of various sub-regions at watershed scale. The aggregated XAI
results provide an explicit and quantitative indicator of hydrologic
connectivity development, offering insights to streamflow variation. This
framework could be used to facilitate aggregation of other hydrologic responses
to advance process understandings.

  Actuarial ratemaking depends on high-quality data, yet access to such data is
often limited by the cost of obtaining new data, privacy concerns, etc. In this
paper, we explore synthetic-data generation as a potential solution to these
issues. In addition to discussing generative methods previously studied in the
actuarial literature, we introduce to the insurance community another approach
based on Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). We present a
comparative study using an open-source dataset and evaluating MICE-based models
against other generative models like Variational Autoencoders and Conditional
Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks. We assess how well synthetic data
preserves the original marginal distributions of variables as well as the
multivariate relationships among covariates. We also investigate the
consistency between Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) trained on synthetic data
with GLMs trained on the original data. Furthermore, we assess the ease of use
of each generative approach and study the impact of augmenting original data
with synthetic data on the performance of GLMs for predicting claim counts. Our
results highlight the potential of MICE-based methods in creating high-quality
tabular data while being more user-friendly than the other methods.

  Location and Identification
Authors: Khalid Daud Khattak, Muhammad A. Choudhry

Comments: Paper submitted to 57th North American Power Symposium (NAPS) 2025
\\
  In this paper, we present a data-driven Forward Selection with Neighborhood
Refinement (FSNR) algorithm to determine the number and placement of Phasor
Measurement Units (PMUs) for maximizing deep-learning-based fault diagnosis
performance. Candidate PMU locations are ranked via a cross-validated Support
Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and each selection is refined through local
neighborhood exploration to produce a near-optimal sensor set. The resulting
PMU subset is then supplied to a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for
faulted-line localization and fault-type classification from time-series
measurements. Evaluation on modified IEEE 34- and IEEE 123-bus systems
demonstrates that the proposed FSNR-SVM method identifies a minimal PMU
configuration that achieves the best overall CNN performance, attaining over 96
percent accuracy in fault location and over 99 percent accuracy in fault-type
classification on the IEEE 34 system, and approximately 94 percent accuracy in
fault location and around 99.8 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on
the IEEE 123 system.

  Transfer learning using latent representations from pre-trained speech models
achieves outstanding performance in tasks where labeled data is scarce.
However, their applicability to non-speech data and the specific acoustic
properties encoded in these representations remain largely unexplored. In this
study, we investigate both aspects. We evaluate five pre-trained speech models
on eight baby cries datasets, encompassing 115 hours of audio from 960 babies.
For each dataset, we assess the latent representations of each model across all
available classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that the latent
representations of these models can effectively classify human baby cries and
encode key information related to vocal source instability and identity of the
crying baby. In addition, a comparison of the architectures and training
strategies of these models offers valuable insights for the design of future
models tailored to similar tasks, such as emotion detection.

Title: Variational Uncertainty Decomposition for In-Context Learning
Authors: I. Shavindra Jayasekera, Jacob Si, Wenlong Chen, Filippo Valdettaro,
  A. Aldo Faisal, Yingzhen Li
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) gain popularity in conducting prediction
tasks in-context, understanding the sources of uncertainty in in-context
learning becomes essential to ensuring reliability. The recent hypothesis of
in-context learning performing predictive Bayesian inference opens the avenue
for Bayesian uncertainty estimation, particularly for decomposing uncertainty
into epistemic uncertainty due to lack of in-context data and aleatoric
uncertainty inherent in the in-context prediction task. However, the
decomposition idea remains under-explored due to the intractability of the
latent parameter posterior from the underlying Bayesian model. In this work, we
introduce a variational uncertainty decomposition framework for in-context
learning without explicitly sampling from the latent parameter posterior, by
optimising auxiliary queries as probes to obtain an upper bound to the
aleatoric uncertainty of an LLM's in-context learning procedure, which also
induces a lower bound to the epistemic uncertainty. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world tasks, we show quantitatively and qualitatively that
the decomposed uncertainties obtained from our method exhibit desirable
properties of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

Title: Distribution estimation via Flow Matching with Lipschitz guarantees
Authors: Lea Kunkel
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.ST stat.TH
MSC-class: 62E17, 62G07, 68T07
\\
  Flow Matching, a promising approach in generative modeling, has recently
gained popularity. Relying on ordinary differential equations, it offers a
simple and flexible alternative to diffusion models, which are currently the
state-of-the-art. Despite its empirical success, the mathematical understanding
of its statistical power so far is very limited. This is largely due to the
sensitivity of theoretical bounds to the Lipschitz constant of the vector field
which drives the ODE. In this work, we study the assumptions that lead to
controlling this dependency. Based on these results, we derive a convergence
rate for the Wasserstein $1$ distance between the estimated distribution and
the target distribution which improves previous results in high dimensional
setting. This rate applies to certain classes of unbounded distributions and
particularly does not require $\log$-concavity.

Title: ESTM: An Enhanced Dual-Branch Spectral-Temporal Mamba for Anomalous
  Sound Detection
Authors: Chengyuan Ma, Peng Jia, Hongyue Guo, and Wenming Yang
Categories: cs.SD cs.LG
Comments: Accepted in IEEE Signal Processing Letters 2025
\\
  The core challenge in industrial equipment anoma lous sound detection (ASD)
lies in modeling the time-frequency coupling characteristics of acoustic
features. Existing modeling methods are limited by local receptive fields,
making it difficult to capture long-range temporal patterns and cross-band
dynamic coupling effects in machine acoustic features. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, ESTM, which is based on a dual-path Mamba
architecture with time-frequency decoupled modeling and utilizes Selective
State-Space Models (SSM) for long-range sequence modeling. ESTM extracts rich
feature representations from different time segments and frequency bands by
fusing enhanced Mel spectrograms and raw audio features, while further
improving sensitivity to anomalous patterns through the TriStat-Gating (TSG)
module. Our experiments demonstrate that ESTM improves anomalous detection
performance on the DCASE 2020 Task 2 dataset, further validating the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Wild Refitting for Model-Free Excess Risk Evaluation of Opaque ML/AI
  Models under Bregman Loss
Authors: Haichen Hu, David Simchi-Levi
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We study the problem of evaluating the excess risk of classical penalized
empirical risk minimization (ERM) with Bregman losses. We show that by
leveraging the recently proposed wild refitting procedure (Wainwright, 2025),
one can efficiently upper bound the excess risk through the so-called "wild
optimism," without relying on the global structure of the underlying function
class. This property makes our approach inherently model-free. Unlike
conventional analyses, our framework operates with just one dataset and
black-box access to the training procedure. The method involves randomized
vector-valued symmetrization with an appropriate scaling of the prediction
residues and constructing artificially modified outcomes, upon which we retrain
a second predictor for excess risk estimation. We establish high-probability
performance guarantees both under the fixed design setting and the random
design setting, demonstrating that wild refitting under Bregman losses, with an
appropriately chosen wild noise scale, yields a valid upper bound on the excess
risk. This work thus is promising for theoretically evaluating modern opaque ML
and AI models such as deep neural networks and large language models, where the
model class is too complex for classical learning theory and empirical process
techniques to apply.

  The integration of digital twinning technologies is driving next-generation
networks toward new capabilities, allowing operators to thoroughly understand
network conditions, efficiently analyze valuable radio data, and innovate
applications through user-friendly, immersive interfaces. Building on this
foundation, network digital twins (NDTs) accurately depict the operational
processes and attributes of network infrastructures, facilitating predictive
management through real-time analysis and measurement. However, constructing
precise NDTs poses challenges, such as integrating diverse data sources,
mapping necessary attributes from physical networks, and maintaining
scalability for various downstream tasks. Unlike previous works that focused on
the creation and mapping of NDTs from scratch, we explore intra- and
inter-operations among NDTs within a Unified Twin Transformation (UTT)
framework, which uncovers a new computing paradigm for efficient transfer,
merging, and splitting of NDTs to create task-oriented twins. By leveraging
joint multi-modal and distributed mapping mechanisms, UTT optimizes resource
utilization and reduces the cost of creating NDTs, while ensuring twin model
consistency. A theoretical analysis of the distributed mapping problem is
conducted to establish convergence bounds for this multi-modal gated
aggregation process. Evaluations on real-world twin-assisted applications, such
as trajectory reconstruction, human localization, and sensory data generation,
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of interoperability among NDTs
for corresponding task development.

\\
  We propose a general two-period model where electrical vehicles (EVs) can
reserve charging sessions in the day-ahead market and swap them in the
real-time market. Under the model, we explore several candidate mechanisms for
running the two markets, compared using several normative properties such as
incentive compatibility, efficiency, reservation awareness, and budget balance.
Specifically, reservation awareness is the only property coupling the two
markets and dictates that an EV will not get a lower utility by joining the
real-time market. Focusing on the real-time market, we show that two variants
of the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism do not satisfy all the
proposed properties; specifically, one is not reservation-aware, while the
other is not budget-balanced. Moreover, we show that no mechanism satisfies
some combinations of the properties. Then, we propose to use a posted-price
mechanism to resolve the issue, which turns out to be the dynamic pricing
mechanism adopted in many real-world systems. The proposed mechanism has no
efficiency guarantee but satisfies all the other properties. To improve
efficiency, we propose to use a VCG auction in the day-ahead market that guides
the reserve prices in the real-time market. When EVs' valuations in the two
markets are highly correlated, the proposed approach results in highly
efficient outcomes.

Title: Mean-payoff and Energy Discrete Bidding Games
Authors: Guy Avni, Suman Sadhukhan
Categories: cs.GT cs.FL cs.MA
\\
  A \emph{bidding} game is played on a graph as follows. A token is placed on
an initial vertex and both players are allocated budgets. In each turn, the
players simultaneously submit bids that do not exceed their available budgets,
the higher bidder moves the token, and pays the bid to the lower bidder. We
focus on \emph{discrete}-bidding, which are motivated by practical applications
and restrict the granularity of the players' bids, e.g, bids must be given in
cents. We study, for the first time, discrete-bidding games with {\em
mean-payoff} and {\em energy} objectives. In contrast, mean-payoff {\em
continuous}-bidding games (i.e., no granularity restrictions) are understood
and exhibit a rich mathematical structure. The {\em threshold} budget is a
necessary and sufficient initial budget for winning an energy game or
guaranteeing a target payoff in a mean-payoff game. We first establish
existence of threshold budgets; a non-trivial property due to the concurrent
moves of the players. Moreover, we identify the structure of the thresholds,
which is key in obtaining compact strategies, and in turn, showing that finding
threshold is in \NP~and \coNP even in succinctly-represented games.

Title: Adaptation of Parameters in Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems
Authors: Hyungbo Shim and Jin Gyu Lee and B. D. O. Anderson
Categories: eess.SY cs.MA cs.SY
Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures, IEEE Conf. on Decision and Control 2025
\\
  This paper proposes an adaptation mechanism for heterogeneous multi-agent
systems to align the agents' internal parameters, based on enforced consensus
through strong couplings. Unlike homogeneous systems, where exact consensus is
attainable, the heterogeneity in node dynamics precludes perfect
synchronization. Nonetheless, previous work has demonstrated that strong
coupling can induce approximate consensus, whereby the agents exhibit emergent
collective behavior governed by the so-called blended dynamics. Building on
this observation, we introduce an adaptation law that gradually aligns the
internal parameters of agents without requiring direct parameter communication.
The proposed method reuses the same coupling signal employed for state
synchronization, which may result in a biologically or sociologically plausible
adaptation process. Under a persistent excitation condition, we prove that the
linearly parametrized vector fields of the agents converge to each other,
thereby making the dynamics asymptotically homogeneous, and leading to exact
consensus of the state variables.

Title: Passivity Compensation: A Distributed Approach for Consensus Analysis in
  Heterogeneous Networks
Authors: Yongkang Su, Sei Zhen Khong and Lanlan Su
Categories: eess.SY cs.MA cs.SY
\\
  This paper investigates a passivity-based approach to output consensus
analysis in heterogeneous networks composed of non-identical agents coupled via
nonlinear interactions, in the presence of measurement and/or communication
noise. Focusing on agents that are input-feedforward passive (IFP), we first
examine whether a shortage of passivity in some agents can be compensated by a
passivity surplus in others, in the sense of preserving the passivity of the
transformed open-loop system defined by the agent dynamics and network
topology. We show that such compensation is only feasible when at most one
agent lacks passivity, and we characterise how this deficit can be offset using
the excess passivity within the group of agents. For general networks, we then
investigate passivity compensation within the feedback interconnection by
leveraging the passivity surplus in the coupling links to locally compensate
for the lack of passivity in the adjacent agents. In particular, a distributed
condition, expressed in terms of passivity indices and coupling gains, is
derived to ensure output consensus of the interconnected network.

Title: Ireland in 2057: Projections using a Geographically Diverse Dynamic
  Microsimulation
Authors: Se\'an Caulfield Curley, Karl Mason, Patrick Mannion
Categories: cs.CY cs.MA
Comments: 29 pages, 6 figures
\\
  This paper presents a dynamic microsimulation model developed for Ireland,
designed to simulate key demographic processes and individual life-course
transitions from 2022 to 2057. The model captures four primary events: births,
deaths, internal migration, and international migration, enabling a
comprehensive examination of population dynamics over time. Each individual in
the simulation is defined by five core attributes: age, sex, marital status,
highest level of education attained, and economic status. These characteristics
evolve stochastically based on transition probabilities derived from empirical
data from the Irish context. Individuals are spatially disaggregated at the
Electoral Division level. By modelling individuals at this granular level, the
simulation facilitates in-depth local analysis of demographic shifts and
socioeconomic outcomes under varying scenarios and policy assumptions. The
model thus serves as a versatile tool for both academic inquiry and
evidence-based policy development, offering projections that can inform
long-term planning and strategic decision-making through 2057. The
microsimulation achieves a close match in population size and makeup in all
scenarios when compared to Demographic Component Methods. Education levels are
projected to increase significantly, with nearly 70% of young people projected
to attain a third level degree at some point in their lifetime. The
unemployment rate is projected to nearly half as a result of the increased
education levels.

Title: Harnessing Information in Incentive Design
Authors: Raj Kiriti Velicheti, Subhonmesh Bose, Tamer Ba\c{s}ar
Categories: cs.GT cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY math.OC
Comments: Initial Version
\\
  Incentive design deals with interaction between a principal and an agent
where the former can shape the latter's utility through a policy commitment. It
is well known that the principal faces an information rent when dealing with an
agent that has informational advantage. In this work, we embark on a systematic
study of the effect of information asymmetry in incentive design games.
Specifically, we first demonstrate that it is in principal's interest to
decrease this information asymmetry. To mitigate this uncertainty, we let the
principal gather information either by letting the agent shape her belief (aka
Information Design), or by paying to acquire it. Providing solutions to all
these cases we show that while introduction of uncertainty increases the
principal's cost, letting the agent shape its belief can be advantageous. We
study information asymmetry and information acquisition in both matrix games
and quadratic Gaussian game setups.

Title: A Survey on Evaluation Metrics for Music Generation
Authors: Faria Binte Kader, Santu Karmaker
Categories: cs.SD cs.MM eess.AS
Comments: 19 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Despite significant advancements in music generation systems, the
methodologies for evaluating generated music have not progressed as expected
due to the complex nature of music, with aspects such as structure, coherence,
creativity, and emotional expressiveness. In this paper, we shed light on this
research gap, introducing a detailed taxonomy for evaluation metrics for both
audio and symbolic music representations. We include a critical review
identifying major limitations in current evaluation methodologies which
includes poor correlation between objective metrics and human perception,
cross-cultural bias, and lack of standardization that hinders cross-model
comparisons. Addressing these gaps, we further propose future research
directions towards building a comprehensive evaluation framework for music
generation evaluation.

Title: Body Ownership Affects the Processing of Sensorimotor Contingencies in
  Virtual Reality

\\
  Presence in virtual reality (VR), the subjective sense of "being there" in a
virtual environment, is notoriously difficult to measure.
Electroencephalography (EEG) may offer a promising, unobtrusive means of
assessing a user's momentary state of presence. Unlike traditional
questionnaires, EEG does not interrupt the experience or rely on users'
retrospective self-reports, thereby avoiding interference with the very state
it aims to capture. Previous research has attempted to quantify presence in
virtual environments using event-related potentials (ERPs). We contend,
however, that previous efforts have fallen short of fully realizing this goal,
failing to either A) independently manipulate presence, B) validate their
measure of presence against traditional techniques, C) adequately separate the
constructs of presence and attention, and/or D) implement a realistic and
immersive environment and task. We address these shortcomings in a
preregistered ERP experiment in which participants play an engaging target
shooting game in VR. ERPs are time-locked to the release of a ball from a
sling. We induce breaks in presence (BIPs) by freezing the ball's release on a
minority of trials. Embodiment is manipulated by allowing manual manipulation
of the sling with a realistic avatar in one condition (embodied condition) and
passive manipulation with only controllers in another (non-embodied condition).
We support our predictions that the N2, the P3b, and the N400, are selectively
sensitive towards specific components of these manipulations. The pattern of
findings carries significant implications for theories of presence, which have
been seldom addressed in previous ERP investigations on this topic.

  We present Quantum Brush, an open-source digital painting tool that harnesses
quantum computing to generate novel artistic expressions. The tool includes
four different brushes that translate strokes into unique quantum algorithms,
each highlighting a different way in which quantum effects can produce novel
aesthetics. Each brush is designed to be compatible with the current noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, as demonstrated by executing them on
IQM's Sirius device.

  Error-bounded lossy compression is one of the most efficient solutions to
reduce the volume of scientific data. For lossy compression, progressive
decompression and random-access decompression are critical features that enable
on-demand data access and flexible analysis workflows. However, these features
can severely degrade compression quality and speed. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel streaming compression framework that supports
both progressive decompression and random-access decompression while
maintaining high compression quality and speed. Our contributions are
three-fold: (1) we design the first compression framework that simultaneously
enables both progressive decompression and random-access decompression; (2) we
introduce a hierarchical partitioning strategy to enable both streaming
features, along with a hierarchical prediction mechanism that mitigates the
impact of partitioning and achieves high compression quality -- even comparable
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) non-streaming compressor SZ3; and (3) our framework
delivers high compression and decompression speed, up to 6.7$\times$ faster
than SZ3.
