Title: V-Math: An Agentic Approach to the Vietnamese National High School
  Graduation Mathematics Exams
Authors: Duong Q. Nguyen and Quy P. Nguyen and Nguyen Van Nhon and Quang-Thinh
  Bui and H. Nguyen-Xuan
Categories: cs.AI cs.CV cs.CY
\\
  This paper develops an autonomous agentic framework called V-Math that aims
to assist Vietnamese high school students in preparing for the National High
School Graduation Mathematics Exams (NHSGMEs). The salient framework integrates
three specialized AI agents: a specification-matrix-conditioned question
generator, a solver/explainer for detailed step-by-step reasoning, and a
personalized tutor that adapts to student performance. Beyond enabling
self-paced student practice, V-Math supports teachers by generating innovative,
compliant exam questions and building diverse, high-quality question banks.
This reduces manual workload and enriches instructional resources. We describe
the system architecture, focusing on practice modes for learners and
teacher-oriented features for question generation. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate that V-Math produces matrix-aligned exams with high solution
accuracy, delivers coherent explanations, and enhances the variety of practice
materials. These results highlight its potential to support scalable, equitable
mathematics preparation aligned with national standards while also empowering
teachers through AI-assisted exam creation.

Title: DISPLIB: a library of train dispatching problems
Authors: Oddvar Kloster, Bj{\o}rnar Luteberget, Carlo Mannino, Giorgio Sartor
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

Title: InPhyRe Discovers: Large Multimodal Models Struggle in Inductive
  Physical Reasoning
Authors: Gautam Sreekumar and Vishnu Naresh Boddeti
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 35 pages including appendix
\\
  Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

Title: LLMAP: LLM-Assisted Multi-Objective Route Planning with User Preferences
Authors: Liangqi Yuan and Dong-Jun Han and Christopher G. Brinton and Sabine
  Brunswicker
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

  Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

Title: AIssistant: An Agentic Approach for Human--AI Collaborative Scientific
  Work on Reviews and Perspectives in Machine Learning
Authors: Sasi Kiran Gaddipati, Farhana Keya, Gollam Rabby, S\"oren Auer
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

Title: Small Models, Big Results: Achieving Superior Intent Extraction through
  Decomposition
Authors: Danielle Cohen, Yoni Halpern, Noam Kahlon, Joel Oren, Omri Berkovitch,
  Sapir Caduri, Ido Dagan, Anatoly Efros
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

Title: Building Coding Agents via Entropy-Enhanced Multi-Turn Preference
  Optimization
Authors: Jiahao Yu, Zelei Cheng, Xian Wu, Xinyu Xing
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

  A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

Title: Reasoning Models Can be Accurately Pruned Via Chain-of-Thought
  Reconstruction
Authors: Ryan Lucas, Kayhan Behdin, Zhipeng Wang, Qingquan Song, Shao Tang,
  Rahul Mazumder
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the
paper can be found at: https://github.com/RyanLucas3/RAC

  Sample size calculations for power analysis are critical for clinical
research and trial design, yet their complexity and reliance on statistical
expertise create barriers for many researchers. We introduce PowerGPT, an
AI-powered system integrating large language models (LLMs) with statistical
engines to automate test selection and sample size estimation in trial design.
In a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness, PowerGPT significantly
improved task completion rates (99.3% vs. 88.9% for test selection, 99.3% vs.
77.8% for sample size calculation) and accuracy (94.1% vs. 55.4% in sample size
estimation, p < 0.001), while reducing average completion time (4.0 vs. 9.3
minutes, p < 0.001). These gains were consistent across various statistical
tests and benefited both statisticians and non-statisticians as well as
bridging expertise gaps. Already under deployment across multiple institutions,
PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility,
efficiency, and accuracy in statistical power analysis for clinical research.

Title: Physical Complexity of a Cognitive Artifact
Authors: G\"ulce Karde\c{s}, David Krakauer, Joshua Grochow
Categories: cs.AI cs.CY cs.HC
\\
  Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

\\
  Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at
entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation
(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to
Information Systems is a practical template for usable XAI in public safety
analytics.

  We introduce a novel training methodology named zELO, which optimizes
retrieval performance via the analysis that ranking tasks are statically
equivalent to a Thurstone model. Based on the zELO method, we use unsupervised
data in order train a suite of state-of-the-art open-weight reranker models:
zerank-1 and zerank-1-small. These models achieve the highest retrieval scores
in multiple domains, including finance, legal, code, and STEM, outperforming
closed-source proprietary rerankers on both NDCG@10 and Recall. These models
also demonstrate great versatility, maintaining their 0-shot performance on
out-of-domain and private customer datasets. The training data included 112,000
queries and 100 documents per query, and was trained end-to-end from
unannotated queries and documents in less than 10,000 H100-hours.

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live
production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable
improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple
deployments.

Comments: 12 pages, 5 Figures, 4 Tables
\\
  We present Match Chat, a real-time, agent-driven assistant designed to
enhance the tennis fan experience by delivering instant, accurate responses to
match-related queries. Match Chat integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) with Generative Computing (GenComp) techniques to synthesize key
insights during live tennis singles matches. The system debuted at the 2025
Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million
users with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural
language queries. The architecture is grounded in an Agent-Oriented
Architecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to
pre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components.
The Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response
time of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over
96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing
to a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal
effort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a
frictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical
familiarity. Across both Grand Slam deployments, Match Chat maintained 100%
uptime and supported nearly 1 million unique users, underscoring the
scalability and reliability of the platform. This work introduces key design
patterns for real-time, consumer-facing AI systems that emphasize speed,
precision, and usability that highlights a practical path for deploying
performant agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Title: DaSAThco: Data-Aware SAT Heuristics Combinations Optimization via Large
  Language Models
Authors: Minyu Chen, Guoqiang Li
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: 11 pages
\\
  The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

  Approach for Financial Sentiment Analysis
Authors: Anmol Singhal Navya Singhal
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: IEEE AIxB 2025
\\
  Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market
movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been
renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

Title: GBV-SQL: Guided Generation and SQL2Text Back-Translation Validation for
  Multi-Agent Text2SQL
Authors: Daojun Chen, Xi Wang, Shenyuan Ren, Qingzhi Ma, Pengpeng Zhao, and An
  Liu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

Title: Mob-based cattle weight gain forecasting using ML models
Authors: Muhammad Riaz Hasib Hossain, Rafiqul Islam, Shawn R McGrath, Md

Journal-ref: Smart Agricultural Technology, 2025

\\
  Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

Title: ECG-aBcDe: Overcoming Model Dependence, Encoding ECG into a Universal
  Language for Any LLM
Authors: Yong Xia, Jingxuan Li, YeTeng Sun, Jiarui Bu
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 14pages, 6 figures
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

Title: Learn to Relax with Large Language Models: Solving Nonlinear
  Combinatorial Optimization Problems via Bidirectional Coevolution
Authors: Beidan Liu, Zhengqiu Zhu, Chen Gao, Yong Zhao, Wei Qi, Quanjun Yin
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

Title: Large Language Models Imitate Logical Reasoning, but at what Cost?
Authors: Lachlan McGinness, Peter Baumgartner
Categories: cs.AI cs.LO
Comments: This work has been accepted as a main track paper for publication in
  the proceedings of the Australasian Joint Conference on Artificial
  Intelligence 2025 held in Canberra, Australia
\\
  We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

Title: Zero-shot Graph Reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Framework with LLMs
Authors: Hanqing Li, Kiran Sheena Jyothi, Henry Liang, Sharika Mahadevan, Diego

Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

Title: H$^2$R: Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection for Multi-Task LLM Agents
Authors: Shicheng Ye, Chao Yu, Kaiqiang Ke, Chengdong Xu, Yinqi Wei
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

  Language Models on Complex Reasoning

  Yuantao Han, Cangyi Yang, jiaxu Zhang, Feiliang Ren
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

Title: Population Estimation using Deep Learning over Gandhinagar Urban Area
Authors: Jai Singla, Peal Jotania, Keivalya Pandya
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Population estimation is crucial for various applications, from resource
allocation to urban planning. Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses
are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high
resolution (0.3 m) satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of 0.5m
resolution and vector boundaries. Proposed method combines Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) architecture for classification task to classify buildings as
residential and non-residential and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over
Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and
non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level
population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall
F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis
with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By
integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure
planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations
of conventional census-based methodologies. The framework provides
municipalities with a scalable and replicable tool for optimized resource
management in rapidly urbanizing cities, showcasing the efficiency of AI-driven
geospatial analytics in enhancing data-driven urban governance.

  Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic
decision-making.

Title: The Anatomy of Alignment: Decomposing Preference Optimization by
  Steering Sparse Features
Authors: Jeremias Ferrao, Matthijs van der Lende, Ilija Lichkovski, Clement Neo
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Work in Progress
\\
  Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

  Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

Title: Toward PDDL Planning Copilot
Authors: Yarin Benyamin, Argaman Mordoch, Shahaf S. Shperberg, Roni Stern
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are

transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different

Title: Reasoning with Preference Constraints: A Benchmark for Language Models
  in Many-to-One Matching Markets
Authors: Marylou Fauchard, Florian Carichon, Margarida Carvalho and Golnoosh
  Farnadi
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

  The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,
often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers
potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory
expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI
system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an
Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory
stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and
reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.
Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,
regulated environments.

Title: G-CSEA: A Graph-Based Conflict Set Extraction Algorithm for Identifying
  Infeasibility in Pseudo-Boolean Models
Authors: Kanishk Garg, Saranya D., Sanal Kumar, Saurabh Singh, Anupam Purwar
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: This paper presents G-CSEA, a novel graph-based algorithm for rapidly
  diagnosing infeasibility in workforce scheduling models. Inspired by
  Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL), our method efficiently extracts a
  compact conflict set from an implication graph, reducing the initial
  constraint set by approximately 94%
\\
  Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

Title: Simulating Clinical AI Assistance using Multimodal LLMs: A Case Study in
  Diabetic Retinopathy
Authors: Nadim Barakat, William Lotter
Categories: cs.AI cs.CV cs.HC
\\
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

Title: A Scenario-Driven Cognitive Approach to Next-Generation AI Memory
Authors: Linyue Cai, Yuyang Cheng, Xiaoding Shao, Huiming Wang, Yong Zhao, Wei

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence
(AGI), the need for robust and human-like memory systems has become
increasingly evident. Current memory architectures often suffer from limited
adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support
continuous learning. To address these limitations, we propose a scenario-driven
methodology that extracts essential functional requirements from representative
cognitive scenarios, leading to a unified set of design principles for
next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the
\textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that
integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a
cohesive design. COLMA provides a structured foundation for developing AI
systems capable of lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, thereby
contributing to the pragmatic development of AGI.

Title: RepIt: Representing Isolated Targets to Steer Language Models
Authors: Vincent Siu and Nathan W. Henry and Nicholas Crispino and Yang Liu and
  Dawn Song and Chenguang Wang
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

Title: Shapes of Cognition for Computational Cognitive Modeling
Authors: Marjorie McShane, Sergei Nirenburg, Sanjay Oruganti, Jesse English
Categories: cs.AI cs.RO
\\
  Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Recently, embedding resources, including models, benchmarks, and datasets,
have been widely released to support a variety of languages. However, the Dutch
language remains underrepresented, typically comprising only a small fraction
of the published multilingual resources. To address this gap and encourage the
further development of Dutch embeddings, we introduce new resources for their
evaluation and generation. First, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark for Dutch (MTEB-NL), which includes both existing Dutch datasets and
newly created ones, covering a wide range of tasks. Second, we provide a
training dataset compiled from available Dutch retrieval datasets, complemented
with synthetic data generated by large language models to expand task coverage
beyond retrieval. Finally, we release a series of E5-NL models compact yet
efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple
tasks. We make our resources publicly available through the Hugging Face Hub
and the MTEB package.

\\
  As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is
shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and
inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral
depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension
skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables
and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured
as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted
distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question
answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial
variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues
such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models
outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation
and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This
brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models
refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of
the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this
gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of
performance.

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted in EARL 25: The 2nd Workshop on Evaluating and Applying
  Recommender Systems with Large Language Models at RecSys 2025

\\
  The evaluation bottleneck in recommendation systems has become particularly
acute with the rise of Generative AI, where traditional metrics fall short of
capturing nuanced quality dimensions that matter in specialized domains like
legal research. Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges
of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled
approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal
contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.
  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which
inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and
human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons
between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that
traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in
the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2
and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge
selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system
comparisons.
  Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that
maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was
once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically
principled, evaluation framework.

  LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the
potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address
the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as
such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector,
SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder
leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive
pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three
popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a
general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in
the out-of-domain setting.

  Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain
presents unique challenges due to the critical demands for accuracy, relevance,
and domain-specific expertise. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics, such
as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, often fall short in distinguishing between
high-quality outputs, especially given the open-ended nature of medical
question answering (QA) tasks where multiple valid responses may exist. In this
work, we introduce MORQA (Medical Open-Response QA), a new multilingual
benchmark designed to assess the effectiveness of NLG evaluation metrics across
three medical visual and text-based QA datasets in English and Chinese. Unlike
prior resources, our datasets feature 2-4+ gold-standard answers authored by
medical professionals, along with expert human ratings for three English and
Chinese subsets. We benchmark both traditional metrics and large language model
(LLM)-based evaluators, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, finding that LLM-based
approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with
expert judgments. We further analyze factors driving this improvement,
including LLMs' sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability
among reference answers. Our results provide the first comprehensive,
multilingual qualitative study of NLG evaluation in the medical domain,
highlighting the need for human-aligned evaluation methods. All datasets and
annotations will be publicly released to support future research.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare
necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However,
existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese
medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances
curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8
fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its
construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert
feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both
high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and
error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that
while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely
localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models
falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a
frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify
correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning
techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By
highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical
applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of
more factually reliable and medically aware models.

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP 2025 Main
\\
  The effectiveness of in-context learning relies heavily on selecting
demonstrations that provide all the necessary information for a given test
input. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify and cover fine-grained
knowledge requirements. However, prior methods often retrieve demonstrations
based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in
irrelevant or redundant examples. In this paper, we propose TopicK, a topic
coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to
comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both the test input and
the model. Specifically, TopicK estimates the topics required by the input and
assesses the model's knowledge on those topics. TopicK then iteratively selects
demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics, in which
the model exhibits low topical knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of
TopicK through extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and
closed-source LLMs. Our source code is available at

Title: Does Language Model Understand Language?
Authors: Suvojit Acharjee, Utathya Aich, Asfak Ali
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Despite advances in natural language generation and understanding, LM still
struggle with fine grained linguistic phenomena such as tense, negation, voice,
and modality which are the elements central to effective human communication.
In the context of the United Nations SDG 4, where linguistic clarity is
critical, the deployment of LMs in educational technologies demands careful
scrutiny. As LMs are increasingly powering applications like tutoring systems,
automated grading, and translation, their alignment with human linguistic
interpretation becomes essential for effective learning. In this study, we
conduct a evaluation of SOTA language models across these challenging contexts
in both English and Bengali. To ensure a structured assessment, we introduce a
new Route for Evaluation of Cognitive Inference in Systematic Environments
guidelines. Our proposed LUCID dataset, composed of carefully crafted sentence
pairs in English and Bengali, specifically challenges these models on critical
aspects of language comprehension, including negation, tense, voice variations.
We assess the performance of SOTA models including MISTRAL-SABA-24B,
LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Compound-Beta using standard
metrics like Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and Mean Absolute
Error, as well as novel, linguistically inspired metric the HCE accuracy. The
HCE accuracy measures how often model predictions fall within one standard
deviation of the mean human rating, thus capturing human like tolerance for
variability in language interpretation. Our findings highlight Compound-Beta as
the most balanced model, consistently achieving high correlations and low MAEs
across diverse language conditions. It records the highest Pearson correlation
in English and demonstrates robust performance on mixed-language data,
indicating a strong alignment with human judgments in cross lingual scenarios.

Title: Audited Reasoning Refinement: Fine-Tuning Language Models via LLM-Guided
  Step-Wise Evaluation and Correction
Authors: Sumanta Bhattacharyya and Sara Riaz and Pedram Rooshenas
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct
human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with
reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can
be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose
Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into
supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates
initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific
inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies,
to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to
calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual
preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a
case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams
(EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where
prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600
EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes
spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a
practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce
domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

  In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed
transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data
scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models
(LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly
degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we
present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically
combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement
learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex
speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized
for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise
robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other
real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most
LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks,
they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to
production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on
real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in
practical settings.

\\
  This work compares three pipelines for training transformer-based neural
networks to produce machine translators for Bambara, a Mand\`e language spoken
in Africa by about 14,188,850 people. The first pipeline trains a simple
transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second
fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures
for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were
trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF
scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The
third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural
network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides
language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to
generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and
Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although
simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on
Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri
dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF.
Instructor-based models perform better on single datasets than on aggregated
collections, suggesting they capture dataset-specific patterns more
effectively.

  Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces
challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome
this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained
audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt,
which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike
traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the
audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental
results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using
MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by
the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results
achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no
keyword list is used.

Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely
adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce
significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost
analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while
neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by
different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the
efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and
demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source
approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage
and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we
propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL
pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching
mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse
parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance
pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and
ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to
baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides
actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing
performance.

Title: Positional Encoding via Token-Aware Phase Attention
Authors: Yu (Sid) Wang, Sheng Shen, R\'emi Munos, Hongyuan Zhan, Yuandong Tian
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 21 pages
\\
  We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)
introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits
RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this
issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such
as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware
Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a
learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token
interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light
fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower
perplexity on long-context than RoPE families.

Title: PAC: Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized Large Language Model-based
  Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Li Fu, Yu Xin, Sunlu Zeng, Lu Fan, Youzheng Wu, Xiaodong He

Comments: Submitted to ICASSP 2026
\\
  This paper presents a Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC) framework to
address two key challenges in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust
homophone discrimination. Both are essential for raw or long-tail word
recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First,
we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an
interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates
grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for
accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative
reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance
the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental
results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets
indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and
53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and
60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong
baselines, respectively.

Title: Don't Change My View: Ideological Bias Auditing in Large Language Models
Authors: Paul Kr\"oger, Emilio Barkett
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in products used
by millions, their outputs may influence individual beliefs and, cumulatively,
shape public opinion. If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered
toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,
then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over
public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can
reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such
steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop
methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt
a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias
auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original
framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language
model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing
distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically
related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable
for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a
series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its
potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

Title: Mitigating Strategy Preference Bias in Emotional Support Conversation
  via Uncertainty Estimations
Authors: Yougen Zhou, Qin Chen, Ningning Zhou, Jie Zhou, Xingjiao Wu, Liang He
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate distress through
empathetic dialogue, yet large language models (LLMs) face persistent
challenges in delivering effective ESC due to low accuracy in strategy
planning. Moreover, there is a considerable preference bias towards specific
strategies. Prior methods using fine-tuned strategy planners have shown
potential in reducing such bias, while the underlying causes of the preference
bias in LLMs have not well been studied. To address these issues, we first
reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge
boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to
mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which
optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for
each region according to the knowledge boundaries. Experiments on the ESCov and
ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show that our approach outperforms
the baselines, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

  Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from
large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical
value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the
labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which
limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two
complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text
Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues
with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without
manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic,
dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague,
incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in
real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and
annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy,
robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual
captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

Title: Towards Inclusive Toxic Content Moderation: Addressing Vulnerabilities
  to Adversarial Attacks in Toxicity Classifiers Tackling LLM-generated Content
Authors: Shaz Furniturewala, Arkaitz Zubiaga
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The volume of machine-generated content online has grown dramatically due to
the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to new challenges
for content moderation systems. Conventional content moderation classifiers,
which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from
misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data
and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence
tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial
training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim
to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute
to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic
interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa
classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups.
We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits.
Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against
adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these
vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training.
We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance
or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves
performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are
responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can
inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.

Title: Case-Based Decision-Theoretic Decoding with Quality Memories
Authors: Hiroyuki Deguchi, Masaaki Nagata
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted at EMNLP2025 main
\\
  Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding is a decision rule of text generation,
which selects the hypothesis that maximizes the expected utility and robustly
generates higher-quality texts than maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding.
However, it depends on sample texts drawn from the text generation model; thus,
it is difficult to find a hypothesis that correctly captures the knowledge or
information of out-of-domain. To tackle this issue, we propose case-based
decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding, another method to estimate the expected
utility using examples of domain data. CBDT decoding not only generates
higher-quality texts than MAP decoding, but also the combination of MBR and
CBDT decoding outperformed MBR decoding in seven domain De--En and
Ja$\leftrightarrow$En translation tasks and image captioning tasks on MSCOCO
and nocaps datasets.

Title: HistoryBankQA: Multilingual Temporal Question Answering on Historical
  Events
Authors: Biswadip Mandal, Anant Khandelwal, Manish Gupta
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks
like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,
timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language
inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets
are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary
events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual
database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and
article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both
historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning
across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA
reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models
(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their
performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer
types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our
work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and
temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To
facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly
available upon acceptance of this paper.

Title: Contrastive Learning with Enhanced Abstract Representations using
  Grouped Loss of Abstract Semantic Supervision
Authors: Omri Suissa, Muhiim Ali, Shengmai Chen, Yinuo Cai, Shekhar Pradhan
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Humans can recognize an image as an instance of a general concept, beyond
simply identifying its objects and their relationships. In this paper, we
investigate 1. The extent to which VLMs have this concept abstraction capacity,
and 2. Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images
that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this
capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped
image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image
captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level
conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the
model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the
information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main
contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image
contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which
measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our
training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept
abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed
to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training
forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic
representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the
higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that
this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in
abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable prowess in text
generation, yet producing long-form, factual documents grounded in extensive
external knowledge bases remains a significant challenge. Existing "top-down"
methods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve
evidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the
available knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven
framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is
predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure"
strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source
corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform
exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into
distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven
foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical
outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the
generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source
material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and
fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on
both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is
expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios
that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. Our work presents an
effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured, long-form documents,
paving the way for more robust LLM applications in high-stakes,
knowledge-intensive domains.

Title: Data Augmentation for Maltese NLP using Transliterated and Machine

Authors: Kurt Micallef, Nizar Habash, Claudia Borg
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP Camera-Ready
\\
  Maltese is a unique Semitic language that has evolved under extensive
influence from Romance and Germanic languages, particularly Italian and
English. Despite its Semitic roots, its orthography is based on the Latin
script, creating a gap between it and its closest linguistic relatives in
Arabic. In this paper, we explore whether Arabic-language resources can support
Maltese natural language processing (NLP) through cross-lingual augmentation
techniques. We investigate multiple strategies for aligning Arabic textual data
with Maltese, including various transliteration schemes and machine translation
(MT) approaches. As part of this, we also introduce novel transliteration
systems that better represent Maltese orthography. We evaluate the impact of
these augmentations on monolingual and mutlilingual models and demonstrate that
Arabic-based augmentation can significantly benefit Maltese NLP tasks.

  The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of
effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities,
their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2
and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,
image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting
and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable
insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but
struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA
substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy
when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal
settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent
challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal
grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

Title: The LLM Already Knows: Estimating LLM-Perceived Question Difficulty via
  Hidden Representations
Authors: Yubo Zhu, Dongrui Liu, Zecheng Lin, Wei Tong, Sheng Zhong, Jing Shao
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language
models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive
inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling,
auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur
substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the
hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level
generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate
the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient
and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state,
without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual
and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty
estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency,
Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer
generated tokens.

Authors: Shiyu Li, Yang Tang, Ruijie Liu, Shi-Zhe Chen, Xi Chen
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: EMNLP 2025 Oral
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance
in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing
LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding
models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM
trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data
and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on
this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to
better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs
use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional
mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less
effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually
transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more
comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard
negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative
examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with
only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA
performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese
MTEB (May 19, 2025).

Title: Automated Generation of Research Workflows from Academic Papers: A
  Full-text Mining Framework
Authors: Heng Zhang, Chengzhi Zhang
Categories: cs.CL cs.DL cs.IR
Journal-ref: Journal of Informetrics, 2025
\\
  The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated
technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,
process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving
scientific paradigms. Source code and data are available at:

  Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning
of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well
understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower
computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study
of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and
learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally
performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,
with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning
dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies
found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies
may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more
research in the low-compute regime.

\\
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine
reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by
incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor
descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we
compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k
Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both
neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic
metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented
criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness
-- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture
readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural
nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures.
This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in
handling cultural content.

  Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing
to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing
sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or
pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and
lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this

integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to
enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented
response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a
\textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps
into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature
extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that
reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head
cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a
\textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level,
statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide
instruction comprehension.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
many domains, yet their appli- cation to specialized fields remains constrained
by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a
novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by
using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.
Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel
tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through
multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing over- fitting and
ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves
75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a
larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models - when fine
tuned properly - can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that
are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of
synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a
highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is
infeasible. Beyond expand- ing research in the growing field of specialized
small language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime
safety, security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various
industries.

Title: Shaping Explanations: Semantic Reward Modeling with Encoder-Only
  Transformers for GRPO
Authors: Francesco Pappone, Ruggero Marino Lazzaroni, Federico Califano,
  Niccol\`o Gentile, Roberto Marras
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text,
aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical
soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning
techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on
brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic
essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel
approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)
framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient
encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a
dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a
generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards
explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and
conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of
training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations,
following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic
reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a
strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models
for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

Title: Empowering LLMs with Parameterized Skills for Adversarial Long-Horizon
  Planning
Authors: Sijia Cui, Shuai Xu, Aiyao He, Yanna Wang, Bo Xu
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to IJCNN 2025
\\
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the
development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents
that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon
environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to
interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,
and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to
stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable
actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate
high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning
framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon
environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill
library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill
planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized
skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a
long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and
challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting
outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully
crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.
Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6
closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately
releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our
code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.

Title: LLM Hallucination Detection: A Fast Fourier Transform Method Based on
  Hidden Layer Temporal Signals
Authors: Jinxin Li and Gang Tu and ShengYu Cheng and Junjie Hu and Jinting Wang
  and Rui Chen and Zhilong Zhou and Dongbo Shan
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models
(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods
largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally
constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,
that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their
effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal
Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that
models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive
generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across
layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain
representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as
spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of
LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable
detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over
10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By
integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD
establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

Title: The Few-shot Dilemma: Over-prompting Large Language Models
Authors: Yongjian Tang, Doruk Tuncel, Christian Koerner, Thomas Runkler
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: accepted for the main track of FLLM
\\
  Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to
diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the
conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this
few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three
standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and
TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including
GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.
Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific
examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,
which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot
examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software
engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world
software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the
number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their
optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior
performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus
surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and
non-functional requirements.

Title: Evaluating LLM Alignment on Personality Inference from Real-World
  Interview Data
Authors: Jianfeng Zhu, Julina Maharjan, Xinyu Li, Karin G. Coifman, Ruoming Jin
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring
nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,
counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret
human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains
unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While
prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on
social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth
personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely
unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising
semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five
trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance
across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with
GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA
architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT
and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson
correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits
remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with
validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal
gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on
latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings
underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and
motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and
alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

  Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing
information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on
chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when
models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present
ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during
chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model
attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced
interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided
attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our
approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains
of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results
demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the
reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

  Recent advances in deep-research systems have demonstrated the potential for
AI agents to autonomously discover and synthesize knowledge from external
sources. In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for
building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an
iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov
Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving
reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context
suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual
approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that
generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity
escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap
between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we
find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use
capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our
paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent
multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive
experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher
achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary
systems.

  Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

  Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language
Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand
precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop
these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of
function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in
which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step
towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central
challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how
to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through
interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable
framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are
fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling
scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first
endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them
for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,
tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,
AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.

Comments: An agent system for open-ended deep research

  This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

  Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web

Title: Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged
  Information?

Comments: 34 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal
representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer
LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and
operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually
provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,
or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate
popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that
they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,
suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization
methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations
often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated
them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken
together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental
controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful
insights into the operations of LLMs.

  Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

Title: RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections
Authors: Lu Cai, Fei Xu, Min Xian, Yalei Tang, Shoukun Sun, and John Stempien
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

  Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative

human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'

current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

Title: EfficientNet-Based Multi-Class Detection of Real, Deepfake, and Plastic
  Surgery Faces
Authors: Li Kun, Milena Radenkovic
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in
our everyday lives. It not only exhibits progress in computer vision but also
constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal
information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques.
Certain individuals endeavour to sabotage election campaigns or subvert
prominent political figures by creating deceptive pictures to influence public
perception, causing significant harm to a nation's political and economic
structure.

Title: A Modern Look at Simplicity Bias in Image Classification Tasks
Authors: Xiaoguang Chang, Teng Wang and Changyin Sun
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

Title: GraphDerm: Fusing Imaging, Physical Scale, and Metadata in a

  Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

Title: PATIMT-Bench: A Multi-Scenario Benchmark for Position-Aware Text Image
  Machine Translation in Large Vision-Language Models
Authors: Wanru Zhuang, Wenbo Li, Zhibin Lan, Xu Han, Peng Li, Jinsong Su
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

Title: Domain Adaptive SAR Wake Detection: Leveraging Similarity Filtering and
  Memory Guidance
Authors: He Gao, Baoxiang Huang, Milena Radenkovic, Borui Li, and Ge Chen
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all- weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adap- tation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like dis- tributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature- Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated tar- get pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

Title: Uncertainty-Aware Hourly Air Temperature Mapping at 2 km Resolution via
  Physics-Guided Deep Learning
Authors: Shengjie Kris Liu, Siqin Wang, Lu Zhang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

  Neighbor Classification for Animal Re-identification
Authors: Anthony Miyaguchi, Chandrasekaran Maruthaiyannan and Charles R. Clark
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: CLEF 2025 working notes
\\
  This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at

Title: GhostNetV3-Small: A Tailored Architecture and Comparative Study of
  Distillation Strategies for Tiny Images
Authors: Florian Zager and Hamza A. A. Gardi
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

  Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

Title: DYNAMO: Dependency-Aware Deep Learning Framework for Articulated
  Assembly Motion Prediction
Authors: Mayank Patel, Rahul Jain, Asim Unmesh, and Karthik Ramani
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

  Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

  Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

  Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

  Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

Comments: To appear in ICCV 2025
\\
  mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

Title: Instance-Guided Class Activation Mapping for Weakly Supervised Semantic
  Segmentation
Authors: Ali Torabi, Sanjog Gaihre, MD Mahbubur Rahman, Yaqoob Majeed
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Title: Artist-Created Mesh Generation from Raw Observation
Authors: Yao He, Youngjoong Kwon, Wenxiao Cai, Ehsan Adeli
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

Title: Axis-Aligned 3D Stalk Diameter Estimation from RGB-D Imagery
Authors: Benjamin Vail, Rahul Harsha Cheppally, Ajay Sharda, and Sidharth Rai
Categories: cs.CV

\\
  Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present
a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from
RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation,
3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and
agronomic research.

Title: Neural Collapse-Inspired Multi-Label Federated Learning under
  Label-Distribution Skew
Authors: Can Peng, Yuyuan Liu, Yingyu Yang, Pramit Saha, Qianye Yang, J. Alison

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

Title: Agent4FaceForgery: Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Realistic Face Forgery
  Detection
Authors: Yingxin Lai, Zitong Yu, Jun Wang, Linlin Shen, Yong Xu, Xiaochun Cao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

Title: Explicit Multimodal Graph Modeling for Human-Object Interaction
  Detection
Authors: Wenxuan Ji, Haichao Shi, Xiao-Yu zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

Title: VQT-Light:Lightweight HDR Illumination Map Prediction with Richer
  Texture.pdf
Authors: Kunliang Xie
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 11 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in run-ning
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estima-tion. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than con-tinuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of in-put image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
im-proves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Adaptive Sampling Scheduler
Authors: Qi Wang, Shuliang Zhu, Jinjia Zhou
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 10 pages, 10 figures,2 Tables, 18 Equations
\\
  Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

Title: DisorientLiDAR: Physical Attacks on LiDAR-based Localization
Authors: Yizhen Lao, Yu Zhang, Ziting Wang, Chengbo Wang, Yifei Xue and Wanpeng
  Shao
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

Title: Exploring Spectral Characteristics for Single Image Reflection Removal
Authors: Pengbo Guo, Chengxu Liu, Guoshuai Zhao, Xingsong Hou, Jialie Shen,
  Xueming Qian
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

Title: CIARD: Cyclic Iterative Adversarial Robustness Distillation
Authors: Liming Lu, Shuchao Pang, Xu Zheng, Xiang Gu, Anan Du, Yunhuai Liu,
  Yongbin Zhou
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

Title: Beyond Artificial Misalignment: Detecting and Grounding
  Semantic-Coordinated Multimodal Manipulations
Authors: Jinjie Shen, Yaxiong Wang, Lechao Cheng, Nan Pu, Zhun Zhong
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

  Cross-View Geo-Localization
Authors: YiTong Liu and TianZhu Liu and YanFeng GU
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 17 pages, 13 figures
\\
  Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

Title: A Comparative Study of YOLOv8 to YOLOv11 Performance in Underwater
  Vision Tasks
Authors: Gordon Hung and Ivan Felipe Rodriguez

Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures, 10 tables
\\
  Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision

  Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our

  Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in

\\
  Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and

\\
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

  Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

Title: SPGen: Spherical Projection as Consistent and Flexible Representation
  for Single Image 3D Shape Generation
Authors: Jingdong Zhang, Weikai Chen, Yuan Liu, Jionghao Wang, Zhengming Yu,

DOI: 10.1145/3757377.3763959
\\
  Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

Title: Defense-to-Attack: Bypassing Weak Defenses Enables Stronger Jailbreaks
  in Vision-Language Models
Authors: Yunhan Zhao, Xiang Zheng, Xingjun Ma
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication
\\
  Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

Title: Effective Gaussian Management for High-fidelity Object Reconstruction
Authors: Jiateng Liu, Hao Gao, Jiu-Cheng Xie, Chi-Man Pun, Jian Xiong, Haolun
  Li and Feng Xu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Title: Modelling and analysis of the 8 filters from the "master key filters
  hypothesis" for depthwise-separable deep networks in relation to idealized
  receptive fields based on scale-space theory
Authors: Tony Lindeberg, Zahra Babaiee and Peyman M. Kiasari
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 24 pages, 11 figures, 17 tables
\\
  This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

Title: What Makes a Good Generated Image? Investigating Human and Multimodal
  LLM Image Preference Alignment
Authors: Rishab Parthasarathy, Jasmine Collins, Cory Stephenson
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 7 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables; appendix 16 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables
\\
  Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

Title: Recurrent Cross-View Object Geo-Localization
Authors: Xiaohan Zhang, Si-Yuan Cao, Xiaokai Bai, Yiming Li, Zhangkai Shen, Zhe
  Wu, Xiaoxi Hu, Hui-liang Shen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

Authors: Yiwei Xu, Xiang Wang, Yifei Yu, Wentian Gan, Luca Morelli, Giulio
  Perda, Xiongwu Xiao, Zongqian Zhan, Xin Wang, and Fabio Remondino
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Title: DyGLNet: Hybrid Global-Local Feature Fusion with Dynamic Upsampling for
  Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Yican Zhao, Ce Wang, You Hao, Lei Li, Tianli Liao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 18pages, under review
\\
  Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

Title: BATR-FST: Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers
Authors: Mohammed Al-Habib, Zuping Zhang, Abdulrahman Noman
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE
  International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Rome, Italy 2025
\\
  Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

Title: CECT-Mamba: a Hierarchical Contrast-enhanced-aware Model for Pancreatic
  Tumor Subtyping from Multi-phase CECT
Authors: Zhifang Gong, Shuo Gao, Ben Zhao, Yingjing Xu, Yijun Yang, Shenghong
  Ju, Guangquan Zhou
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

Title: Modeling the Multivariate Relationship with Contextualized
  Representations for Effective Human-Object Interaction Detection
Authors: Zhehao Li, Yucheng Qian, Chong Wang, Yinghao Lu, Zhihao Yang, Jiafei
  Wu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Title: Double Helix Diffusion for Cross-Domain Anomaly Image Generation
Authors: Linchun Wu, Qin Zou, Xianbiao Qi, Bo Du, Zhongyuan Wang and Qingquan
  Li
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

Title: Superpixel Anything: A general object-based framework for accurate yet
  regular superpixel segmentation
Authors: Julien Walther, R\'emi Giraud, Micha\"el Cl\'ement
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

a cohesive and user-friendly system. This unified framework allows for the
rapid transformation of a single concept image or textual description into a

and high-fidelity PBR textures. We demonstrate that assets generated by
Hunyuan3D Studio are not only visually compelling but also adhere to the
stringent technical requirements of contemporary game engines, significantly
reducing iteration time and lowering the barrier to entry for 3D content

Title: SAGA: Selective Adaptive Gating for Efficient and Expressive Linear
  Attention
Authors: Yuan Cao, Dong Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

  Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

Title: Exploring Metric Fusion for Evaluation of NeRFs
Authors: Shreyas Shivakumara, Gabriel Eilertsen, Karljohan Lundin Palmerius
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted for 17th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia
  Experience (QoMEX 25)
\\
  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

  It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

Title: Cumulative Consensus Score: Label-Free and Model-Agnostic Evaluation of
  Object Detectors in Deployment
Authors: Avinaash Manoharan, Xiangyu Yin, Domenik Helm, Chih-Hong Cheng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

Title: Few to Big: Prototype Expansion Network via Diffusion Learner for Point
  Cloud Few-shot Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Qianguang Zhao, Dongli Wang, Yan Zhou, Jianxun Li, Richard Irampa
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced
editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

Title: Runge-Kutta Approximation and Decoupled Attention for Rectified Flow
  Inversion and Semantic Editing
Authors: Weiming Chen, Zhihan Zhu, Yijia Wang, Zhihai He
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is

Title: MEJO: MLLM-Engaged Surgical Triplet Recognition via Inter- and
  Intra-Task Joint Optimization
Authors: Yiyi Zhang, Yuchen Yuan, Ying Zheng, Jialun Pei, Jinpeng Li, Zheng Li,
  Pheng-Ann Heng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct
extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide

Title: Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing: Enhancing Visual Understanding via
  Sustained Focus on Key Objects in Large Vision-Language Models
Authors: Jianfei Zhao, Feng Zhang, Xin Sun, Lingxing Kong, Zhixing Tan, Chong
  Feng
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

Title: MSGFusion: Multimodal Scene Graph-Guided Infrared and Visible Image
  Fusion
Authors: Guihui Li, Bowei Dong, Kaizhi Dong, Jiayi Li, Haiyong Zheng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

Title: AREPAS: Anomaly Detection in Fine-Grained Anatomy with
  Reconstruction-Based Semantic Patch-Scoring
Authors: Branko Mitic, Philipp Seeb\"ock, Helmut Prosch, Georg Langs
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

  Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

\\
  Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

Title: MATTER: Multiscale Attention for Registration Error Regression

  Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

\\
  3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

Title: Beyond Averages: Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding with Gaussian
  Splatting and Bag of Embeddings
Authors: Abdalla Arafa and Didier Stricker
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

Authors: Yuqi Xie, Shuhan Ye, Chong Wang, Jiazhen Xu, Le Shen, Yuanbin Qian,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

\\
  In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

  Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

  This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

Title: Improving Accuracy and Efficiency of Implicit Neural Representations:
  Making SIREN a WINNER
Authors: Hemanth Chandravamsi, Dhanush V. Shenoy, Steven H. Frankel
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

Comments: This paper presents a draft overview of the emerging field of
  omnidirectional vision in the context of embodied AI
\\
  Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the
environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics,
industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional
pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental
awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the
reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has
historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an
emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional
vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight
recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception,
omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from
both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture
in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems.
Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and
cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied
AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview
synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and
opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose
omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.

Authors: Boyu Han, Qianqian Xu, Shilong Bao, Zhiyong Yang, Sicong Li, Qingming
  Huang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

Title: Brought a Gun to a Knife Fight: Modern VFM Baselines Outgun Specialized
  Detectors on In-the-Wild AI Image Detection
Authors: Yue Zhou, Xinan He, Kaiqing Lin, Bing Fan, Feng Ding, Jinhua Zeng, Bin
  Li
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

  Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

Title: Dream3DAvatar: Text-Controlled 3D Avatar Reconstruction from a Single
  Image
Authors: Gaofeng Liu, Hengsen Li, Ruoyu Gao, Xuetong Li, Zhiyuan Ma, Tao Fang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

Title: Perception Before Reasoning: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Visual
  Reasoning in Vision-Language Models
Authors: Yan Chen and Long Li and Teng Xi and Long Zeng and Jingdong Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

Title: HERO: Rethinking Visual Token Early Dropping in High-Resolution Large
  Vision-Language Models
Authors: Xu Li, Yuxuan Liang, Xiaolei Chen, Yi Zheng, Haotian Chen, Bin Li,
  Xiangyang Xue
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

Title: TFANet: Three-Stage Image-Text Feature Alignment Network for Robust
  Referring Image Segmentation
Authors: Qianqi Lu, Yuxiang Xie, Jing Zhang, Shiwei Zou, Yan Chen, Xidao Luan
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

Title: Using KL-Divergence to Focus Frequency Information in Low-Light Image
  Enhancement
Authors: Yan Xingyang, Huang Xiaohong, Zhang Zhao, You Tian and Xu Ziheng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

\\
  Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

  Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

  The proliferation of sophisticated deepfake technology poses significant

MultiFFDI dataset. By concatenating the feature representations from these
specialized models and training a final classifier layer, HDFF effectively
leverages their collective strengths. This approach achieved a final score of

out of 184 teams, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical fusion for complex

DOI: 10.1109/TPAMI.2025.3604036
\\
  Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

Title: Advancing Real-World Parking Slot Detection with Large-Scale Dataset and
  Semi-Supervised Baseline
Authors: Zhihao Zhang, Chunyu Lin, Lang Nie, Jiyuan Wang, Yao Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)
\\
  As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant

Title: MSDNet: Efficient 4D Radar Super-Resolution via Multi-Stage Distillation
Authors: Minqing Huang, Shouyi Lu, Boyuan Zheng, Ziyao Li, Xiao Tang, Guirong

Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures
\\
  4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Title: TexTAR : Textual Attribute Recognition in Multi-domain and Multi-lingual
  Document Images
Authors: Rohan Kumar, Jyothi Swaroopa Jinka and Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at ICDAR 2025 (Oral)
\\
  Recognizing textual attributes such as bold, italic, underline and strikeout
is essential for understanding text semantics, structure, and visual
presentation. These attributes highlight key information, making them crucial
for document analysis. Existing methods struggle with computational efficiency
or adaptability in noisy, multilingual settings. To address this, we introduce
TexTAR, a multi-task, context-aware Transformer for Textual Attribute
Recognition (TAR). Our novel data selection pipeline enhances context
awareness, and our architecture employs a 2D RoPE (Rotary Positional
Embedding)-style mechanism to incorporate input context for more accurate
attribute predictions. We also introduce MMTAD, a diverse, multilingual,
multi-domain dataset annotated with text attributes across real-world documents
such as legal records, notices, and textbooks. Extensive evaluations show
TexTAR outperforms existing methods, demonstrating that contextual awareness
contributes to state-of-the-art TAR performance.

Title: Enhancing Video Large Language Models with Structured Multi-Video
  Collaborative Reasoning (early version)
Authors: Zhihao He, Tianyao He, Tieyuan Chen, Yun Xu, Huabin Liu, Chaofan Gan,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Authors: Ruifei Ding, Zhe Chen, Wen Fan, Chen Long, Huijuan Xiao, Yelu Zeng,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

Title: More performant and scalable: Rethinking contrastive vision-language
  pre-training of radiology in the LLM era
Authors: Yingtai Li, Haoran Lai, Xiaoqian Zhou, Shuai Ming, Wenxin Ma, Wei Wei,

Comments: MICCAI 2025
\\
  The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to
facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is

Comments: GCPR 2025
\\
  With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video
sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.

Categories: cs.CV
ACM-class: I.2.10; I.4.8
\\
  Violence detection in public surveillance is critical for public safety. This
study addresses challenges such as small-scale targets, complex environments,
and real-time temporal analysis. We propose Vi-SAFE, a spatial-temporal
framework that integrates an enhanced YOLOv8 with a Temporal Segment Network
(TSN) for video surveillance. The YOLOv8 model is optimized with GhostNetV3 as
a lightweight backbone, an exponential moving average (EMA) attention
mechanism, and pruning to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy.
YOLOv8 and TSN are trained separately on pedestrian and violence datasets,
where YOLOv8 extracts human regions and TSN performs binary classification of
violent behavior. Experiments on the RWF-2000 dataset show that Vi-SAFE
achieves an accuracy of 0.88, surpassing TSN alone (0.77) and outperforming
existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its
effectiveness for public safety surveillance. Code is available at

Title: End4: End-to-end Denoising Diffusion for Diffusion-Based Inpainting
  Detection
Authors: Fei Wang, Xuecheng Wu, Zheng Zhang, Danlei Huang, Yuheng Huang, BoWang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

Title: Curriculum Multi-Task Self-Supervision Improves Lightweight
  Architectures for Onboard Satellite Hyperspectral Image Segmentation
Authors: Hugo Carlesso, Josiane Mothe, Radu Tudor Ionescu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

  Ensuring consistent quality in vacuum thermoforming presents challenges due

introduces a vision-based quality control system to predict and optimise

requirements. A comprehensive dataset was developed using visual data from
vacuum-formed samples subjected to various process parameters, supplemented by
image augmentation techniques to improve model training. A k-Nearest Neighbour
algorithm was subsequently employed to identify adjustments needed in process
parameters by mapping low-quality parts to their high-quality counterparts. The
model exhibited strong performance in adjusting heating power, heating time,
and vacuum time to reduce defects and improve production efficiency.

Title: ResidualViT for Efficient Temporally Dense Video Encoding
Authors: Mattia Soldan, Fabian Caba Heilbron, Bernard Ghanem, Josef Sivic,
  Bryan Russell
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.IR eess.IV
\\
  Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

  We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,
feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI
resources in education.

\\
  Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

  We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

\\
  Deploying deep neural network (DNN) accelerators with Layer Temporal
Scheduling (LTS) often incurs significant overheads (e.g., energy and latency),
as intermediate activations must be cached in DRAM. To alleviate this, Tile
Spatial Scheduling (TSS) reduces such costs by fragmenting inter-layer data
into smaller tiles communicated via on-chip links.However, many emerging
applications require concurrent execution of multiple DNNs with complex
topologies, where critical tasks must preempt others to meet stringent latency
requirements (e.g., in autonomous driving, obstacle detection must complete
within tens of milliseconds). Existing TSS works lack support for preemption,
while prior preemption schemes rely on LTS and thus inherit its overheads. This
highlights the need for preemptive and efficient TSS-based frameworks. Yet,
realizing such systems is challenging due to the complexity of enabling
preemption in graphs with large-scale topologies (e.g., modern large language
models may contain tens of thousands of edges). To tackle this, we present
IsoSched, the first framework enabling preemptive multi-DNN scheduling on TSS
architecture. IsoSched first formulates scheduling of complex-topology graphs
as an integer-linear program (ILP) and subgraph isomorphism problem; second, it
applies Layer Concatenate and Split (LCS) for load balancing in tile pipelines;
third, it employs an Ullmann-based algorithm enhanced by Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to accelerate subgraph matching, and uses compact matrix encoding
(i.e., Compressed Sparse Row, CSR) to reduce memory usage. IsoSched outperforms
LTS-PRM approaches (i.e., PREMA, Planaria, CD-MSA, MoCA) in Latency-Bound
Throughput (LBT), speedup, and energy efficiency, and achieves higher critical
task satisfaction than TSS-NPRM (i.e., HASP) across varying task complexities.

Comments: Accepted to ACM MM as Oral Paper, also accepted to ICML MOSS

\\
  Serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently remains challenging due to
the high memory and latency overhead of key-value (KV) cache access during
autoregressive decoding. We present \textbf{TinyServe}, a lightweight and
extensible serving system for deploying tiny LLMs (e.g., TinyLLaMA, GPT2-345M)
with support for structured KV sparsity, plugin-based token selection, and
hardware-efficient attention kernels. Unlike prior simulation frameworks,
TinyServe executes real-time decoding with configurable sparsity strategies and
fine-grained instrumentation.
  To reduce decoding cost, we introduce a \textit{query-aware page selection}
mechanism that leverages bounding-box metadata to estimate attention relevance
between the query and KV cache blocks. This enables selective KV loading with
minimal overhead and no model modifications. Our fused CUDA kernel integrates
page scoring, sparse memory access, and masked attention in a single pass.
  Experiments show that TinyServe achieves up to \textbf{3.4x} speedup and over
\textbf{2x} memory savings with negligible accuracy drop. Additional analysis

as an efficient system-level design for LLM training and inference research on

Title: Research on fault diagnosis and root cause analysis based on full stack
  observability
Authors: Jian Hou
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  With the rapid development of cloud computing and ultra-large-scale data
centers, the scale and complexity of systems have increased significantly,
leading to frequent faults that often show cascading propagation. How to
achieve efficient, accurate, and interpretable Root Cause Analysis (RCA) based
on observability data (metrics, logs, traces) has become a core issue in AIOps.
This paper reviews two mainstream research threads in top conferences and
journals over the past five years: FaultInsight[1] focusing on dynamic causal
discovery and HolisticRCA[2] focusing on multi-modal/cross-level fusion, and
analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods. A KylinRCA
framework integrating the ideas of both is proposed, which depicts the
propagation chain through temporal causal discovery, realizes global root cause
localization and type identification through cross-modal graph learning, and
outputs auditable evidence chains combined with mask-based explanation methods.
A multi-dimensional experimental scheme is designed, evaluation indicators are
clarified, and engineering challenges are discussed, providing an effective
solution for fault diagnosis under full-stack observability.

Title: Towards High-Performance and Portable Molecular Docking on CPUs through
  Vectorization
Authors: Gianmarco Accordi, Jens Domke, Theresa Pollinger, Davide Gadioli,

Categories: cs.DC cs.PF
\\
  Recent trends in the HPC field have introduced new CPU architectures with
improved vectorization capabilities that require optimization to achieve peak
performance and thus pose challenges for performance portability. The
deployment of high-performing scientific applications for CPUs requires
adapting the codebase and optimizing for performance. Evaluating these
applications provides insights into the complex interactions between code,
compilers, and hardware. We evaluate compiler auto-vectorization and explicit
vectorization to achieve performance portability across modern CPUs with long
vectors. We select a molecular docking application as a case study, as it
represents computational patterns commonly found across HPC workloads. We
report insights into the technical challenges, architectural trends, and
optimization strategies relevant to the future development of scientific
applications for HPC. Our results show which code transformations enable
portable auto-vectorization, reaching performance similar to explicit
vectorization. Experimental data confirms that x86 CPUs typically achieve
higher execution performance than ARM CPUs, primarily due to their wider
vectorization units. However, ARM architectures demonstrate competitive energy
consumption and cost-effectiveness.

Title: SynergAI: Edge-to-Cloud Synergy for Architecture-Driven High-Performance
  Orchestration for AI Inference
Authors: Foteini Stathopoulou, Aggelos Ferikoglou, Manolis Katsaragakis,
  Dimosthenis Masouros, Sotirios Xydis, and Dimitrios Soudris
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
has significantly heightened computational demands, particularly for
inference-serving workloads. While traditional cloud-based deployments offer
scalability, they face challenges such as network congestion, high energy
consumption, and privacy concerns. In contrast, edge computing provides
low-latency and sustainable alternatives but is constrained by limited
computational resources. In this work, we introduce SynergAI, a novel framework
designed for performance- and architecture-aware inference serving across
heterogeneous edge-to-cloud infrastructures. Built upon a comprehensive
performance characterization of modern inference engines, SynergAI integrates a
combination of offline and online decision-making policies to deliver
intelligent, lightweight, and architecture-aware scheduling. By dynamically
allocating workloads across diverse hardware architectures, it effectively
minimizes Quality of Service (QoS) violations. We implement SynergAI within a
Kubernetes-based ecosystem and evaluate its efficiency. Our results demonstrate
that architecture-driven inference serving enables optimized and
architecture-aware deployments on emerging hardware platforms, achieving an
average reduction of 2.4x in QoS violations compared to a State-of-the-Art
(SotA) solution.

Title: The Entropy of Parallel Systems
Authors: Temitayo Adefemi
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 6 pages, 1 figure
\\
  Ever since Claude Shannon used entropy for his "Mathematical Theory of
Communication", entropy has become a buzzword in research circles with
scientists applying entropy to describe any phenomena that are reminiscent of
disorder. In this paper, we used entropy to describe the incompatibility
between components in the computer, which can cause noise and disorder within
the parallel cluster. We develop a mathematical theory, primarily based on
graph theory and logarithms, to quantify the entropy of a parallel cluster by
accounting for the entropy of each system within the cluster. We proceed using
this model to calculate the entropy of the Top 10 supercomputers in the Top500
list. Our entropy framework reveals a statistically significant negative
correlation between system entropy and computational performance across the
world's fastest supercomputers. Most notably, the LINPACK benchmark
demonstrates a strong negative correlation (r = -0.7832, p = 0.0077) with our
entropy measure, indicating that systems with lower entropy consistently
achieve higher computational efficiency, this Relationship is further supported
by moderate correlations with MLPerf mixed-precision benchmarks (r = -0.6234)
and HPCC composite scores (r = -0.5890), suggesting the framework's
applicability extends beyond traditional dense linear algebra workloads.

  Vector databases have rapidly grown in popularity, enabling efficient
similarity search over data such as text, images, and video. They now play a
central role in modern AI workflows, aiding large language models by grounding
model outputs in external literature through retrieval-augmented generation.
Despite their importance, little is known about the performance characteristics
of vector databases in high-performance computing (HPC) systems that drive
large-scale science. This work presents an empirical study of distributed
vector database performance on the Polaris supercomputer in the Argonne
Leadership Computing Facility. We construct a realistic biological-text
workload from BV-BRC and generate embeddings from the peS2o corpus using
Qwen3-Embedding-4B. We select Qdrant to evaluate insertion, index construction,
and query latency with up to 32 workers. Informed by practical lessons from our
experience, this work takes a first step toward characterizing vector database
performance on HPC platforms to guide future research and optimization.

  The strategic importance of artificial intelligence is driving a global push
toward Sovereign AI initiatives. Nationwide governments are increasingly
developing dedicated infrastructures, called AI Factories (AIF), to achieve
technological autonomy and secure the resources necessary to sustain robust
local digital ecosystems.
  In Europe, the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking is investing hundreds of millions of
euros into several AI Factories, built atop existing high-performance computing
(HPC) supercomputers. However, while HPC systems excel in raw performance, they
are not inherently designed for usability, accessibility, or serving as
public-facing platforms for AI services such as inference or agentic
applications. In contrast, AI practitioners are accustomed to cloud-native
technologies like Kubernetes and object storage, tools that are often difficult
to integrate within traditional HPC environments.
  This article advocates for a dual-stack approach within supercomputers:
integrating both HPC and cloud-native technologies. Our goal is to bridge the
divide between HPC and cloud computing by combining high performance and
hardware acceleration with ease of use and service-oriented front-ends. This
convergence allows each paradigm to amplify the other. To this end, we will
study the cloud challenges of HPC (Serverless HPC) and the HPC challenges of
cloud technologies (High-performance Cloud).

Title: Analysis and Optimization of Wireless Multimodal Federated Learning on
  Modal Heterogeneity
Authors: Xuefeng Han, Wen Chen, Jun Li, Ming Ding, Qingqing Wu, Kang Wei,
  Xiumei Deng, Yumeng Shao, Qiong Wu
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Multimodal federated learning (MFL) is a distributed framework for training
multimodal models without uploading local multimodal data of clients, thereby
effectively protecting client privacy. However, multimodal data is commonly
heterogeneous across diverse clients, where each client possesses only a subset
of all modalities, renders conventional analysis results and optimization
methods in unimodal federated learning inapplicable. In addition, fixed latency
demand and limited communication bandwidth pose significant challenges for
deploying MFL in wireless scenarios. To optimize the wireless MFL performance
on modal heterogeneity, this paper proposes a joint client scheduling and
bandwidth allocation (JCSBA) algorithm based on a decision-level fusion
architecture with adding a unimodal loss function. Specifically, with the
decision results, the unimodal loss functions are added to both the training
objective and local update loss functions to accelerate multimodal convergence
and improve unimodal performance. To characterize MFL performance, we derive a
closed-form upper bound related to client and modality scheduling and minimize
the derived bound under the latency, energy, and bandwidth constraints through
JCSBA. Experimental results on multimodal datasets demonstrate that the JCSBA
algorithm improves the multimodal accuracy and the unimodal accuracy by 4.06%
and 2.73%, respectively, compared to conventional algorithms.

Title: Asymmetric Grid Quorum Systems for Heterogeneous Processes
Authors: Michael Senn and Christian Cachin
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Quorum systems are a common way to formalize failure assumptions in
distributed systems. Traditionally, these assumptions are shared by all
involved processes. More recently, systems have emerged which allow processes
some freedom in choosing their own, subjective or asymmetric, failure
assumptions. For such a system to work, individual processes' assumptions must
be compatible. However, this leads to a Catch-22-style scenario: How can
processes collaborate to agree on compatible failure assumptions when they have
no compatible failure assumptions to start with?
  We introduce asymmetric grid quorum systems that allow a group of processes
to specify heterogeneous trust assumptions independently of each other and
without coordination. They are based on qualitative attributes describing how
the processes differ. Each process may select a quorum system from this class
that aligns best with its subjective view. The available choices are designed
to be compatible by definition, thereby breaking the cycling dependency.
Asymmetric grid quorum systems have many applications that range from cloud
platforms to blockchain networks.

Title: Space-Time Trade-off in Bounded Iterated Memory
Authors: Guillermo Toyos-Marfurt and Petr Kuznetsov
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: To be presented at the 27th International Symposium on Stabilization,
  Safety, and Security of Distributed Systems (SSS 2025)
\\
  The celebrated asynchronous computability theorem (ACT) characterizes tasks
solvable in the read-write shared-memory model using the unbounded
full-information protocol, where in every round of computation, each process
shares its complete knowledge of the system with the other processes.
Therefore, ACT assumes shared-memory variables of unbounded capacity. It has
been recently shown that boundedvariables can achieve the same computational
power at the expense of extra rounds. However, the exact relationship between
the bit capacity of the shared memory and the number of rounds required in
order to implement one round of the full-information protocol remained unknown.
  In this paper, we focus on the asymptotic round complexity of bounded
iterated shared-memory algorithms that simulate, up to isomorphism, the
unbounded full-information protocol. We relate the round complexity to the
number of processes $n$, the number of iterations of the full information
protocol $r$, and the bit size per shared-memory entry $b$. By analyzing the
corresponding protocol complex, a combinatorial structure representing
reachable states, we derive necessary conditions and present a bounded
full-information algorithm tailored to the bits available $b$ per shared memory
entry. We show that for $n>2$, the round complexity required to implement the
full-information protocol satisfies $\Omega((n!)^{r-1} \cdot 2^{n-b})$. Our
results apply to a range of iterated shared-memory models, from regular
read-write registers to atomic and immediate snapshots. Moreover, our bounded
full-information algorithm is asymptotically optimal for the iterated collect
model and within a linear factor $n$ of optimal for the snapshot-based models.

Title: Scaling Up Throughput-oriented LLM Inference Applications on
  Heterogeneous Opportunistic GPU Clusters with Pervasive Context Management
Authors: Thanh Son Phung and Douglas Thain
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  The widespread growth in LLM developments increasingly demands more
computational power from clusters than what they can supply. Traditional LLM
applications inherently require huge static resource allocations, which force
users to either wait in a long job queue and accept progress delay, or buy
expensive hardware to fulfill their needs and exacerbate the demand-supply
problem. However, not all LLM applications are latency-sensitive and can
instead be executed in a throughput-oriented way. This throughput orientation
allows a dynamic allocation that opportunistically pools available resources
over time, avoiding both the long queue and expensive GPU purchases.
Effectively utilizing opportunistic resources brings numerous challenges
nevertheless. Our solution, pervasive context management, exploits the common
computational context in LLM applications and provides mechanisms and policies
that allow seamless context reuse on opportunistic resources. Our evaluation
shows an LLM application with pervasive context management on opportunistic
resources reduces its execution time by 98.1%.

Authors: Dawei Xiang, Wenyan Xu, Kexin Chu, Zixu Shen, Tianqi Ding, Wei Zhang
Categories: cs.MA cs.AI
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 System Demonstration Track
\\
  The rapid advancement of generative AI has democratized access to powerful
tools such as Text-to-Image models. However, to generate high-quality images,
users must still craft detailed prompts specifying scene, style, and
context-often through multiple rounds of refinement. We propose PromptSculptor,
a novel multi-agent framework that automates this iterative prompt optimization
process. Our system decomposes the task into four specialized agents that work
collaboratively to transform a short, vague user prompt into a comprehensive,
refined prompt. By leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning, our framework
effectively infers hidden context and enriches scene and background details. To
iteratively refine the prompt, a self-evaluation agent aligns the modified
prompt with the original input, while a feedback-tuning agent incorporates user
feedback for further refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that
PromptSculptor significantly enhances output quality and reduces the number of
iterations needed for user satisfaction. Moreover, its model-agnostic design
allows seamless integration with various T2I models, paving the way for
industrial applications.

Title: Between proportionnality and envy-freeness: k-proportionality
Authors: Guillaume Ch\`eze (UT)
Categories: cs.MA cs.GT math.CO
\\
  This article deals with the cake cutting problem. In this setting, there
exists two notions of fair division: proportional division (when there are n
players, each player thinks to get at least 1/n of the cake) and envy-free
division (each player wants to keep his or her share because he or she does not
envy the portion given to another player). Some results are valid for
proportional division but not for envy-free division. Here, we introduce and
study a scale between the proportional division and the envy-free division. The
goal is to understand where is the gap between statements about proportional
division and envy-free division. This scale comes from the notion introduced in
this article: k-proportionality. When k = n this notion corresponds to the
proportional division and when k = 2 it corresponds to envy-free division. With
k-proportionality we can understand where some difficulties in fair division
lie. First, we show that there are situations in which there is no
k-proportional and equitable division of a pie with connected pieces when k
$\le$ n -1. This result was known only for envy-free division, ie k = 2. Next,
we prove that there are situations in which there is no Pareto-optimal
k-proportional division of a cake with connected pieces when k $\le$ n -1. This
result was known only for k = 2. These theorems say that we can get an
impossibility result even if we do not consider an envy-free division but a
weaker notion. Finally, k-proportionality allows to give a generalization with
a uniform statement of theorems about strong envy-free and strong proportional
divisions.

  Synthesis

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Modern power systems are becoming increasingly dynamic, with changing
topologies and time-varying loads driven by renewable energy variability,
electric vehicle adoption, and active grid reconfiguration. Despite these
changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns
and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations
call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal
dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch
attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major
challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive
computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that
significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational
validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint
distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over
feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,
leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at
each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for
structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds
time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability
and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow
not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also
achieves a 98.9\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency
resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and
realistic power grid scenarios.

Title: Scaling Up Data Parallelism in Decentralized Deep Learning
Authors: Bing Xie, Junqi Yin, Zhenyu Zhou, Sarp Oral, Feiyi Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Although it has been extensively explored in theory, decentralized learning
is not yet green-lighted for production use, largely due to a lack of
stability, scalability, and generality in large scale DNN training. To shed
light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies
decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a
benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and
decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking
methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the
variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training
scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to
centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the
issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model
accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections
in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is
surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model
replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive
approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD
method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout
training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada
can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN
training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample
applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for
ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.

Title: MEUV: Achieving Fine-Grained Capability Activation in Large Language
  Models via Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors
Authors: Xin Tong, Zhi Lin, Jingya Wang, Meng Han, Bo Jin
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL cs.CR
Comments: Under Review
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) enforce safety alignment to reliably refuse
malicious requests, yet the same blanket safeguards also block legitimate uses
in policing, defense, and other high-stakes settings. Earlier
"refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single
vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic
control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight
framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned,
nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is
learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a
differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and
several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV
achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B,
and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best
single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged
to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace.
The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is
achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs
deployment in security-sensitive domains.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.DC
Comments: Submitted to IEEE conference for publication
\\
  Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued
for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby
facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models
across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and
regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be
centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training
methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training
local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters.
However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will
hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged
training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of
scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key
bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose
a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically
allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange
strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the
acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher
numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

Categories: cs.OS cs.AI cs.CR cs.DC
\\
  We propose the Ratio1 AI meta-operating system (meta-OS), a decentralized
MLOps protocol that unifies AI model development, deployment, and inference
across heterogeneous edge devices. Its key innovation is an integrated
blockchain-based framework that transforms idle computing resources (laptops,
smartphones, cloud VMs) into a trustless global supercomputer. The architecture
includes novel components: a decentralized authentication layer (dAuth), an
in-memory state database (CSTORE), a distributed storage system (R1FS),
homomorphic encrypted federated learning (EDIL), decentralized container
orchestration (Deeploy) and an oracle network (OracleSync), which collectively
ensure secure, resilient execution of AI pipelines and other container based
apps at scale. The protocol enforces a formal circular token-economic model
combining Proof-of-Availability (PoA) and Proof-of-AI (PoAI) consensus.
Compared to centralized heterogeneous cloud MLOps and existing decentralized
compute platforms, which often lack integrated AI toolchains or trusted Ratio1
node operators (R1OP) mechanics, Ratio1's holistic design lowers barriers for
AI deployment and improves cost-efficiency. We provide mathematical
formulations of its secure licensing and reward protocols, and include
descriptive information for the system architecture and protocol flow. We argue
that our proposed fully functional ecosystem proposes and demonstrates
significant improvements in accessibility, scalability, and security over
existing alternatives.

  We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal

dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on
a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw
and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each
input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific
predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the
routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the
model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting
depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method
consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the
learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance
and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized
healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that
accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to
psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance
treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness
through personalized intervention strategies.

Title: Profiling LoRA/QLoRA Fine-Tuning Efficiency on Consumer GPUs: An RTX

  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with parameter-efficient techniques
such as LoRA and QLoRA has enabled adaptation of foundation models on modest
hardware. Yet the efficiency of such training on consumer-grade GPUs,
especially under strict 8 GB VRAM limits, remains underexplored. We present a
controlled profiling study of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning using the
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060. Across three
representative configurations, we systematically vary batch size, sequence
length, optimizer choice (AdamW vs. PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs. bf16).
We report throughput (tokens/s), time per 10k tokens, and VRAM footprint,
alongside energy estimates derived from GPU board power limits. Our results
show that paged optimizers improve throughput by up to 25% (628 tok/s vs. 500
tok/s baseline), while bf16 degrades efficiency relative to fp16. Despite 8 GB
constraints, sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible using
parameter-efficient strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
case study of LLM fine- tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs, providing
reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for resource-constrained
researchers and practitioners.

Title: Towards Trustworthy Agentic IoEV: AI Agents for Explainable Cyberthreat

  The Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV) envisions a tightly coupled
ecosystem of electric vehicles (EVs), charging infrastructure, and grid
services, yet it remains vulnerable to cyberattacks, unreliable battery-state
predictions, and opaque decision processes that erode trust and performance. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel Agentic Artificial Intelligence
(AAI) framework tailored for IoEV, where specialized agents collaborate to
deliver autonomous threat mitigation, robust analytics, and interpretable
decision support. Specifically, we design an AAI architecture comprising
dedicated agents for cyber-threat detection and response at charging stations,
real-time State of Charge (SoC) estimation, and State of Health (SoH) anomaly
detection, all coordinated through a shared, explainable reasoning layer;
develop interpretable threat-mitigation mechanisms that proactively identify
and neutralize attacks on both physical charging points and learning
components; propose resilient SoC and SoH models that leverage continuous and
adversarial-aware learning to produce accurate, uncertainty-aware forecasts
with human-readable explanations; and implement a three-agent pipeline, where
each agent uses LLM-driven reasoning and dynamic tool invocation to interpret
intent, contextualize tasks, and execute formal optimizations for user-centric
assistance. Finally, we validate our framework through comprehensive
experiments across diverse IoEV scenarios, demonstrating significant
improvements in security and prediction accuracy. All datasets, models, and
code will be released publicly.

Title: Flexible Multimodal Neuroimaging Fusion for Alzheimer's Disease
  Progression Prediction
Authors: Benjamin Burns, Yuan Xue, Douglas W. Scharre, Xia Ning
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: Accepted at Applications of Medical AI 2025
\\
  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high
inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction
aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating
multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to
make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as
is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model
flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel
sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each
modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,
FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art
Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of
modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most
variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of
experts than Flex-MoE.

  The two-stage fine-tuning paradigm of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed
by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empirically shown better reasoning
performance than one-stage SFT for the post-training of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL
are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known
claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that:
(1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD
forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss;
(2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD
capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the
lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries,
\ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the
lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the
forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter
matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance.
Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from
the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable
throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the
\textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of
SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular
vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which
shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions
onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation. Code is available at

Title: Why and How Auxiliary Tasks Improve JEPA Representations
Authors: Jiacan Yu, Siyi Chen, Mingrui Liu, Nono Horiuchi, Vladimir Braverman,
  Zicheng Xu, Dan Haramati, Randall Balestriero
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for
visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its
behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization
of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head
trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation
Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the
latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero,
then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the
same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent
representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the
representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment
corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the
auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately.
Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an
auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the
right equivalence relations.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Networks vs. Physics Models for Non-Invasive
  Glucose Monitoring: A Comparative Study Under Realistic Synthetic Conditions
Authors: Riyaadh Gani
Categories: eess.IV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Non-invasive glucose monitors often fail outside the lab because existing
datasets ignore hardware noise, environmental drift, and person-to-person
physiology. We introduce the first ultra-realistic near-infrared (NIR)
simulator that injects 12-bit ADC quantisation, +/-0.1% LED ageing, photodiode
dark noise, 15-45 C temperature, 30-90% relative humidity, contact-pressure
variation, Fitzpatrick I-VI melanin, and diurnal glucose excursions (dawn
phenomenon). Using this platform (rho glucose-NIR = 0.21), we benchmark six
methods: Enhanced Beer-Lambert (physics-engineered ridge regression), three
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a selective radiative-transfer PINN,
and a shallow DNN. Beer-Lambert achieves 13.6 mg/dL RMSE, 95.8% Clarke-A and
93.8% +/-15% accuracy with only 56 parameters and 0.01 ms inference,
outperforming the best PINN (14.6 mg/dL) and the SDNN baseline (35.1 mg/dL).
Results overturn the assumption that deeper PINNs dominate and supply an open,
end-to-end reference stack for rapid prototyping of embedded optical glucose
sensors.

  Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex
transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with
dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical
application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to
non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context.
Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can
generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with
temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network
using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model
to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals
interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes.
Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by
applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings
improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our
work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks,
emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This
study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine
learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.

\\
  The Quantum-Inspired Stacked Integrated Concept Graph Model (QISICGM) is an
innovative machine learning framework that harnesses quantum-inspired
techniques to predict diabetes risk with exceptional accuracy and efficiency.
Utilizing the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset augmented with 2,000 synthetic
samples to mitigate class imbalance (total: 2,768 samples, 1,949 positives),
QISICGM integrates a self-improving concept graph with a stacked ensemble
comprising Random Forests (RF), Extra Trees (ET), transformers, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), and feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs). This approach
achieves an out-of-fold (OOF) F1 score of 0.8933 and an AUC of 0.8699,
outperforming traditional methods. Quantum inspired elements, such as phase
feature mapping and neighborhood sequence modeling, enrich feature
representations, enabling CPU-efficient inference at 8.5 rows per second. This
paper presents a detailed architecture, theoretical foundations, code insights,
and performance evaluations, including visualizations from the outputs
subfolder. The open-source implementation (v1.0.0) is available at
https://github.com/keninayoung/QISICGM, positioning QISICGM as a potential
benchmark for AI-assisted clinical triage in diabetes and beyond. Ultimately,
this work emphasizes trustworthy AI through calibration, interpretability, and
open-source reproducibility.

Title: A Variational Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework Using
  Petrov-Galerkin Method for Solving Singularly Perturbed Boundary Value
  Problems
Authors: Vijay Kumar and Gautam Singh
Categories: math.NA cs.AI cs.NA
MSC-class: 34D15, 35B25, 65M12, 68T07
\\
  This work proposes a Variational Physics-Informed Neural Network (VPINN)
framework that integrates the Petrov-Galerkin formulation with deep neural
networks (DNNs) for solving one-dimensional singularly perturbed boundary value
problems (BVPs) and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
one or two small parameters. The method adopts a nonlinear approximation in
which the trial space is defined by neural network functions, while the test
space is constructed from hat functions. The weak formulation is constructed
using localized test functions, with interface penalty terms introduced to
enhance numerical stability and accurately capture boundary layers. Dirichlet
boundary conditions are imposed via hard constraints, and source terms are
computed using automatic differentiation. Numerical experiments on benchmark
problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing
significantly improved accuracy in both the $L_2$ and maximum norms compared to
the standard VPINN approach for one-dimensional singularly perturbed
differential equations (SPDEs).

  We propose Omni-CLST, an error-aware Curriculum Learning framework with
guided Selective Chain-of-Thought for audio question answering. The framework
efficiently leverages existing high-quality dataset through two key strategies:
an error-aware curriculum that organizes samples by difficulty, and a guided
thought dropout mechanism that focuses reasoning on challenging cases.
Integrated with GRPO training, these strategies enable the model to learn more
effectively from informative samples. Experiments on MMAU-mini and MMAR
demonstrate that Omni-CLST achieves competitive accuracy (73.80% on MMAU-mini)
and establishes a new state of the art (64.30% on MMAR), highlighting its
robustness and generalization capability in multimodal audio-language
understanding.

Title: Deriving the Scaled-Dot-Function via Maximum Likelihood Estimation and
  Maximum Entropy Approach
Authors: Jiyong Ma
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood estimation approach to
determine the value vector in transformer models. We model the sequence of
value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian
distributions. The variance in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time
step, the corresponding key vector, and the query vector. The mean value in
each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, and the corresponding
value vector. This analysis may offer a new explanation of the
scaled-dot-product function or softmax function used in transformer
architectures [1]. Another explanation, inspired by [4], is based on the
maximum entropy approach in natural language processing [5]. In this approach,
a query vector and key vectors are used to derive the feature functions for the
maximum entropy model.

  Domestic Violence (DV) is a pervasive public health problem characterized by
patterns of coercive and abusive behavior within intimate relationships. With
the rise of social media as a key outlet for DV victims to disclose their
experiences, online self-disclosure has emerged as a critical yet underexplored
avenue for support-seeking. In addition, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and nuanced understanding of DV self-disclosure, support
provisions, and their connections. To address these gaps, this study proposes a
novel computational framework for modeling DV support-seeking behavior
alongside community support mechanisms. The framework consists of four key
components: self-disclosure detection, post clustering, topic summarization,
and support extraction and mapping. We implement and evaluate the framework
with data collected from relevant social media communities. Our findings not
only advance existing knowledge on DV self-disclosure and online support
provisions but also enable victim-centered digital interventions.

Title: C3DE: Causal-Aware Collaborative Neural Controlled Differential Equation
  for Long-Term Urban Crowd Flow Prediction
Authors: Yuting Liu, Qiang Zhou, Hanzhe Li, Chenqi Gong, Jingjing Gu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Long-term urban crowd flow prediction suffers significantly from cumulative
sampling errors, due to increased sequence lengths and sampling intervals,
which inspired us to leverage Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs)
to mitigate this issue. However, regarding the crucial influence of Points of
Interest (POIs) evolution on long-term crowd flow, the multi-timescale
asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distribution, coupled with
latent spurious causality, poses challenges to applying NCDEs for long-term
urban crowd flow prediction. To this end, we propose Causal-aware Collaborative
neural CDE (C3DE) to model the long-term dynamic of crowd flow. Specifically,
we introduce a dual-path NCDE as the backbone to effectively capture the
asynchronous evolution of collaborative signals across multiple time scales.
Then, we design a dynamic correction mechanism with the counterfactual-based
causal effect estimator to quantify the causal impact of POIs on crowd flow and
minimize the accumulation of spurious correlations. Finally, we leverage a
predictor for long-term prediction with the fused collaborative signals of POI
and crowd flow. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of C3DE, particularly in cities with notable flow
fluctuations.

  This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing pricing and replenishment
strategies in fresh food supermarkets by combining Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The LSTM model,
enhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing
trends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated
by the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively
optimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while
adhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows
for dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time
adaptability to market fluctuations. The framework not only maximizes profits
but also reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable supermarket
operations. The attention mechanism enhances the interpretability of the LSTM
model by identifying key time points and factors influencing sales, improving
decision-making accuracy. This methodology bridges the gap between predictive
modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and
inventory management in fresh food retail and other industries dealing with
perishable goods.

Title: Linear Dimensionality Reduction for Word Embeddings in Tabular Data
  Classification
Authors: Liam Ressel and Hamza A. A. Gardi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  The Engineers' Salary Prediction Challenge requires classifying salary
categories into three classes based on tabular data. The job description is
represented as a 300-dimensional word embedding incorporated into the tabular
features, drastically increasing dimensionality. Additionally, the limited
number of training samples makes classification challenging. Linear
dimensionality reduction of word embeddings for tabular data classification
remains underexplored. This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We show that PCA, with an appropriate
subspace dimension, can outperform raw embeddings. LDA without regularization
performs poorly due to covariance estimation errors, but applying shrinkage
improves performance significantly, even with only two dimensions. We propose
Partitioned-LDA, which splits embeddings into equal-sized blocks and performs
LDA separately on each, thereby reducing the size of the covariance matrices.
Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, combined with shrinkage, achieves
top-10 accuracy on the competition public leaderboard. This method effectively
enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited
training samples.

Title: Enhancing Smart Farming Through Federated Learning: A Secure, Scalable,

DOI: 10.47852/bonviewAIA52025089
\\
  The agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation with the integration
of advanced technologies, particularly in data-driven decision-making. This
work proposes a federated learning framework for smart farming, aiming to
develop a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for crop disease detection
tailored to the environmental and operational conditions of Minnesota farms. By
maintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model
updates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease
classification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology
involving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep
learning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for
model refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,
good generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication
and training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases
in future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,
setting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work
comes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations
in agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that
are hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide
a secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize
smart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data
confidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced
machine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of
farmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning.

structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger
catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method
integrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free,
simulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation,
and grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse
policy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static
benchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape
exploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured,
object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. We additionally
show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as
blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those
shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the
utility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement. Finally, we
validate both red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm,
observing that simulated CrashShapes reduce task success from 90% to as low as
22.5%, and that blue-teaming recovers performance to up to 90% on the
corresponding real-world geometry -- closely matching simulation outcomes.

Title: Amulet: a Python Library for Assessing Interactions Among ML Defenses
  and Risks
Authors: Asim Waheed, Vasisht Duddu, Rui Zhang, Sebastian Szyller, N. Asokan
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
Comments: 12 pages, 4 figures
\\
  ML models are susceptible to risks to security, privacy, and fairness.
Several defenses are designed to protect against their intended risks, but can
inadvertently affect susceptibility to other unrelated risks, known as
unintended interactions. Several jurisdictions are preparing ML regulatory
frameworks that require ML practitioners to assess the susceptibility of ML
models to different risks. A library for valuating unintended interactions that
can be used by (a) practitioners to evaluate unintended interactions at scale
prior to model deployment and (b) researchers to design defenses which do not
suffer from an unintended increase in unrelated risks. Ideally, such a library
should be i) comprehensive by including representative attacks, defenses and
metrics for different risks, ii) extensible to new modules due to its modular
design, iii) consistent with a user-friendly API template for inputs and
outputs, iv) applicable to evaluate previously unexplored unintended
interactions. We present AMULET, a Python library that covers risks to
security, privacy, and fairness, which satisfies all these requirements. AMULET
can be used to evaluate unexplored unintended interactions, compare
effectiveness between defenses or attacks, and include new attacks and
defenses.

Title: Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML): Inducing Causal World Models for
  Few-Shot Generalization
Authors: Mohamed Zayaan S
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Modern deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but remain
fundamentally limited by their reliance on spurious correlations, leading to
poor generalization and a demand for massive datasets. We argue that a key
ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems
from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce
Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer
the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key
modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic
representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the
underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning
module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared
causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to
novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and
counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a
new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our
experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art
meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding
true causal inference.

  3D printing has long been a technology for industry professionals and
enthusiasts willing to tinker or even build their own machines. This stands in
stark contrast to today's market, where recent developments have prioritized
ease of use to attract a broader audience. Slicing software nowadays has a few
ways to sanity check the input file as well as the output gcode. Our approach
introduces a novel layer of support by training an AI model to detect common
issues in 3D models. The goal is to assist less experienced users by
identifying features that are likely to cause print failures due to difficult
to print geometries before printing even begins.

  Software Engineering, ASE 2025 (Industry track)
\\
  Large language models have shown impressive performance in various domains,
including code generation across diverse open-source domains. However, their
applicability in proprietary industrial settings, where domain-specific
constraints and code interdependencies are prevalent, remains largely
unexplored. We present a case study conducted in collaboration with the
leveling department at ASML to investigate the performance of LLMs in
generating functional, maintainable code within a closed, highly specialized
software environment.
  We developed an evaluation framework tailored to ASML's proprietary codebase
and introduced a new benchmark. Additionally, we proposed a new evaluation
metric, build@k, to assess whether LLM-generated code successfully compiles and
integrates within real industrial repositories. We investigate various
prompting techniques, compare the performance of generic and code-specific
LLMs, and examine the impact of model size on code generation capabilities,
using both match-based and execution-based metrics. The findings reveal that
prompting techniques and model size have a significant impact on output
quality, with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting yielding the highest
build success rates. The difference in performance between the code-specific
LLMs and generic LLMs was less pronounced and varied substantially across
different model families.

  The rapid adoption of foundation models (e.g., large language models) has
given rise to promptware, i.e., software built using natural language prompts.
Effective management of prompts, such as organization and quality assurance, is
essential yet challenging. In this study, we perform an empirical analysis of
24,800 open-source prompts from 92 GitHub repositories to investigate prompt
management practices and quality attributes. Our findings reveal critical
challenges such as considerable inconsistencies in prompt formatting,
substantial internal and external prompt duplication, and frequent readability
and spelling issues. Based on these findings, we provide actionable
recommendations for developers to enhance the usability and maintainability of
open-source prompts within the rapidly evolving promptware ecosystem.

  Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a promising approach to solve
second-quantised Hamiltonians, because of their scalability and flexibility. In
this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum
embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA)
framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to
represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control
mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding
loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations
of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the
exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the
computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the
high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop,
rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the
critical need for more efficient inference techniques.

Title: Reinforcement Learning-Based Market Making as a Stochastic Control on
  Non-Stationary Limit Order Book Dynamics
Authors: Rafael Zimmer, Oswaldo Luiz do Valle Costa
Categories: q-fin.TR cs.AI
Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 31 equations
\\
  Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a promising framework for developing
adaptive and data-driven strategies, enabling market makers to optimize
decision-making policies based on interactions with the limit order book
environment. This paper explores the integration of a reinforcement learning
agent in a market-making context, where the underlying market dynamics have
been explicitly modeled to capture observed stylized facts of real markets,
including clustered order arrival times, non-stationary spreads and return
drifts, stochastic order quantities and price volatility. These mechanisms aim
to enhance stability of the resulting control agent, and serve to incorporate
domain-specific knowledge into the agent policy learning process. Our
contributions include a practical implementation of a market making agent based
on the Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, alongside a comparative
evaluation of the agent's performance under varying market conditions via a
simulator-based environment. As evidenced by our analysis of the financial
return and risk metrics when compared to a closed-form optimal solution, our
results suggest that the reinforcement learning agent can effectively be used
under non-stationary market conditions, and that the proposed simulator-based
environment can serve as a valuable tool for training and pre-training
reinforcement learning agents in market-making scenarios.

  MRI Anomaly Classification
Authors: Fazle Rafsani, Jay Shah, Catherine D. Chong, Todd J. Schwedt, Teresa
  Wu
Categories: eess.IV cs.AI cs.CV
Comments: ACCEPTED at the ICCV 2025 Workshop on Anomaly Detection with
  Foundation Models
\\
  Anomaly detection and classification in medical imaging are critical for
early diagnosis but remain challenging due to limited annotated data, class
imbalance, and the high cost of expert labeling. Emerging vision foundation
models such as DINOv2, pretrained on extensive, unlabeled datasets, offer
generalized representations that can potentially alleviate these limitations.
In this study, we propose an attention-based global aggregation framework
tailored specifically for 3D medical image anomaly classification. Leveraging
the self-supervised DINOv2 model as a pretrained feature extractor, our method
processes individual 2D axial slices of brain MRIs, assigning adaptive
slice-level importance weights through a soft attention mechanism. To further
address data scarcity, we employ a composite loss function combining supervised
contrastive learning with class-variance regularization, enhancing inter-class
separability and intra-class consistency. We validate our framework on the ADNI
dataset and an institutional multi-class headache cohort, demonstrating strong
anomaly classification performance despite limited data availability and
significant class imbalance. Our results highlight the efficacy of utilizing
pretrained 2D foundation models combined with attention-based slice aggregation
for robust volumetric anomaly detection in medical imaging. Our implementation
is publicly available at https://github.com/Rafsani/DinoAtten3D.git.

\\
  In visuomotor policy learning, the control policy for the robotic agent is
derived directly from visual inputs. The typical approach, where a policy and
vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel
visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy
network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent
developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is
more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has
found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness
in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show
that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline
model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying
levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can
maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in
promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence
for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.

Title: DeepEyeNet: Generating Medical Report for Retinal Images
Authors: Jia-Hong Huang
Categories: eess.IV cs.AI cs.CV
Comments: The paper is accepted by the Conference on Information and Knowledge
  Management (CIKM), 2025
\\
  The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge
to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the
available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and
treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of
generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation,
which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining
ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal
images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle
patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI
systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis,
reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases.
The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report
generation: (1) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions
between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive
medical reports; (2) Improved methods for medical keyword representation
enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (3)
Strategies to overcome RNN-based models' limitations, particularly in capturing
long-range dependencies within medical descriptions; (4) Techniques to enhance
the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust
and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated
using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis
demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by
automating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency,
diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.

  Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic
understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often
struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract
poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data
Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that
effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data
for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional
multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to
comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights.
Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's
generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE
outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal
models, demonstrating substantial improvements in C-index ranging from 3.8% to
11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8% to 8.8% on independent cohorts,
respectively. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable data efficiency across diverse
clinical scenarios. With its enhanced generalizability and data efficiency,
MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis
prediction, holding strong potential to personalize tailored therapies and
improve treatment outcomes.

Title: ScaleDoc: Scaling LLM-based Predicates over Large Document Collections
Authors: Hengrui Zhang, Yulong Hui, Yihao Liu, Huanchen Zhang
Categories: cs.DB cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Predicates are foundational components in data analysis systems. However,
modern workloads increasingly involve unstructured documents, which demands
semantic understanding, beyond traditional value-based predicates. Given
enormous documents and ad-hoc queries, while Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate powerful zero-shot capabilities, their high inference cost leads to
unacceptable overhead. Therefore, we introduce \textsc{ScaleDoc}, a novel
system that addresses this by decoupling predicate execution into an offline
representation phase and an optimized online filtering phase. In the offline
phase, \textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations
for each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model
on these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only
the ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore,
\textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant
efficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy
model to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade
mechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific
accuracy targets. Our evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that
\textsc{ScaleDoc} achieves over a 2$\times$ end-to-end speedup and reduces
expensive LLM invocations by up to 85\%, making large-scale semantic analysis
practical and efficient.

Title: ActiveVLN: Towards Active Exploration via Multi-Turn RL in
  Vision-and-Language Navigation
Authors: Zekai Zhang, Weiye Zhu, Hewei Pan, Xiangchen Wang, Rongtao Xu, Xing
  Sun and Feng Zheng
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow
natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments.
Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and
often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While
effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training
costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However,
prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend
on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended
active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and
plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose
ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through
multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is
used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively
predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and
optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL
efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail
or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.
Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL
baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training
methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art
approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.

  Agentic workflows promise efficiency, but adoption hinges on whether people
actually trust systems that act on their behalf. We present DoubleAgents, an
agentic planning tool that embeds transparency and control through user
intervention, value-reflecting policies, rich state visualizations, and
uncertainty flagging for human coordination tasks. A built-in respondent
simulation generates realistic scenarios, allowing users to rehearse, refine
policies, and calibrate their reliance before live use. We evaluate
DoubleAgents in a two-day lab study (n=10), two deployments (n=2), and a
technical evaluation. Results show that participants initially hesitated to
delegate but grew more reliant as they experienced transparency, control, and
adaptive learning during simulated cases. Deployment results demonstrate
DoubleAgents' real-world relevance and usefulness, showing that the effort
required scaled appropriately with task complexity and contextual data. We
contribute trust-by-design patterns and mechanisms for proactive AI --
consistency, controllability, and explainability -- along with simulation as a
safe path to build and calibrate trust over time.

Comments: 25 pages
\\
  Code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerate
software development. However, their frequent generation of insecure code
presents serious risks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of seven
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, demonstrating substantial
gains in secure code generation without compromising functionality. Our
research identifies prompt-tuning as the most effective PEFT method, achieving
an 80.86% Overall-Secure-Rate on CodeGen2 16B, a 13.5-point improvement over
the 67.28% baseline. Optimizing decoding strategies through sampling
temperature further elevated security to 87.65%. This equates to a reduction of
approximately 203,700 vulnerable code snippets per million generated. Moreover,
prompt and prefix tuning increase robustness against poisoning attacks in our
TrojanPuzzle evaluation, with strong performance against CWE-79 and CWE-502
attack vectors. Our findings generalize across Python and Java, confirming
prompt-tuning's consistent effectiveness. This study provides essential
insights and practical guidance for building more resilient software systems

Title: Leveraging Intermediate Representations of Time Series Foundation Models
  for Anomaly Detection
Authors: Chan Sik Han, Keon Myung Lee
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 10 pages,8 figures
\\
  Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable
operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models
(TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However,
existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a
task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection
approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations.
Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and
patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep
forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training
data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining
distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score
for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate
representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep
integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the
collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from
incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive,
which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a
broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and
foundation model-based methods.

\\
  In this paper, we study a latticized optimization problem with fuzzy
relational inequality constraints where the feasible region is formed as the
intersection of two inequality fuzzy systems and Sugeno-Weber family of t-norms
is considered as fuzzy composition. Sugeno-Weber family of t-norms and
t-conorms is one of the most applied one in various fuzzy modelling problems.
This family of t-norms and t-conorms was suggested by Weber for modeling
intersection and union of fuzzy sets. Also, the t-conorms were suggested as
addition rules by Sugeno for so-called alpha-fuzzy measures. The resolution of
the feasible region of the problem is firstly investigated when it is defined
with max-Sugeno-Weber composition and a necessary and sufficient condition is
presented for determining the feasibility. Then, based on some theoretical
properties of the problem, an algorithm is presented for solving this nonlinear
problem. It is proved that the algorithm can find the exact optimal solution
and an example is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm.

Comments: Accepted by Findings of EMNLP 2025
\\
  Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where
small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic
fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can
have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a
result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the
paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons
between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically
analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting
these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR)
method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of
using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we
randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance,

and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair
comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness

Title: Joint AoI and Handover Optimization in Space-Air-Ground Integrated
  Network

  Despite the widespread deployment of terrestrial networks, providing reliable
communication services to remote areas and maintaining connectivity during
emergencies remains challenging. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations
offer promising solutions with their global coverage capabilities and reduced
latency, yet struggle with intermittent coverage and limited communication
windows due to orbital dynamics. This paper introduces an age of information
(AoI)-aware space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture that
leverages a high-altitude platform (HAP) as intelligent relay between the LEO
satellites and ground terminals. Our three-layer design employs hybrid
free-space optical (FSO) links for high-capacity satellite-to-HAP communication
and reliable radio frequency (RF) links for HAP-to-ground transmission, and
thus addressing the temporal discontinuity in LEO satellite coverage while
serving diverse user priorities. Specifically, we formulate a joint
optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the AoI and satellite handover
frequency through optimal transmit power distribution and satellite selection
decisions. This highly dynamic, non-convex problem with time-coupled
constraints presents significant computational challenges for traditional
approaches. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel diffusion model
(DM)-enhanced dueling double deep Q-network with action decomposition and state
transformer encoder (DD3QN-AS) algorithm that incorporates transformer-based
temporal feature extraction and employs a DM-based latent prompt generative
module to refine state-action representations through conditional denoising.
Simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach
compared with policy-based methods and some other deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) benchmarks.

Title: Unbiased Online Curvature Approximation for Regularized Graph Continual
  Learning
Authors: Jie Yin, Ke Sun, Han Wu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 9 pages
\\
  Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of
graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic
forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free,
class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes.
In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL
based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix
(FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its
variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal
approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To
overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature
approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our
method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without
explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to
better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the
knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability
(retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).

Title: A Graph Machine Learning Approach for Detecting Topological Patterns in
  Transactional Graphs

\\
  The rise of digital ecosystems has exposed the financial sector to evolving
abuse and criminal tactics that share operational knowledge and techniques both
within and across different environments (fiat-based, crypto-assets, etc.).
Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect
sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the
need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious
activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we
propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis
to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within
transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of
traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled
information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis.
Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves
(i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage
large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying
automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once
the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among
the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants
are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that
this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex
financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional
rule-based detection systems.

  In this work, deep neural networks made up of multiple hidden Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) and Feedforward layers are trained to predict the thermal
behavior of the joint motors of robot manipulators. A model-free and scalable
approach is adopted. It accommodates complexity and uncertainty challenges
stemming from the derivation, identification, and validation of a large number
of parameters of an approximation model that is hardly available. To this end,
sensed joint torques are collected and processed to foresee the thermal

  Robots are unrelentingly used to achieve operational efficiency in Industry
4.0 along with symbiotic and sustainable assistance for the work-force in
Industry 5.0. As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in
anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous
anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors
overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots
are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user
experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in
advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their
lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown,
when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories
and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement
after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with
generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage
thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal
difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational
autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the
thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from
emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.

  Robot-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly improve the lives
of individuals with mobility impairments. To ensure an effective and
comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging
deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements
throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions
-- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world
applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system
capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as
robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy
trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to
fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal
feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's
adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in
simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human
study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully
dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being
adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior
baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback. Video are available at

  Robots operating in domestic and office environments must understand object
ownership to correctly execute instructions such as ``Bring me my cup.''
However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To
address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework
that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to
users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that
maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to
improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge
from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared
or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through
experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory
setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy
with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the
effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense
reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge
for practical and socially appropriate task execution.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to
address key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination,
outdated knowledge, and lacking reference. However, current RAG frameworks
often struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully
contribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter
out irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final
performance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel
metric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct
answer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference
of LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented.
Further, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to
train a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from
exact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can
effectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones
for better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and
benchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing
approaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on
NaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match
accuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG
respectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary
model GPT-4o across all datasets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of
InfoGain-RAG as it can offer a reliable solution for RAG in multiple
applications.

  Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential in medical AI.
Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) offers a computationally efficient way to
quantify model uncertainty alongside predictions, unlike traditional methods
such as Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout and Deep Ensembles (DE). However, all these
methods often rely on a single expert's annotations as ground truth for model
training, overlooking the inter-rater variability in healthcare. To address
this issue, we propose MEGAN, a Multi-Expert Gating Network that aggregates
uncertainty estimates and predictions from multiple AI experts via EDL models
trained with diverse ground truths and modeling strategies. MEGAN's gating
network optimally combines predictions and uncertainties from each EDL model,
enhancing overall prediction confidence and calibration. We extensively
benchmark MEGAN on endoscopy videos for Ulcerative colitis (UC) disease
severity estimation, assessed by visual labeling of Mayo Endoscopic Subscore
(MES), where inter-rater variability is prevalent. In large-scale prospective
UC clinical trial, MEGAN achieved a 3.5% improvement in F1-score and a 30.5%
reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, MEGAN facilitated uncertainty-guided sample stratification,
reducing the annotation burden and potentially increasing efficiency and
consistency in UC trials.

  Machine learning models and libraries can train datasets of different sizes
and perform prediction and classification operations, but machine learning
models and libraries cause slow and long training times on large datasets. This
article introduces EmbeddedML, a training-time-optimized and mathematically
enhanced machine learning library. The speed was increased by approximately
times compared to scikit-learn without any loss in terms of accuracy in
regression models such as Multiple Linear Regression. Logistic Regression and
Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms have been mathematically rewritten to
reduce training time and increase accuracy in classification models. With the
applied mathematical improvements, training time has been reduced by
approximately 2 times for SVM on small datasets and by around 800 times on
large datasets, and by approximately 4 times for Logistic Regression, compared
to the scikit-learn implementation. In summary, the EmbeddedML library offers
regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms
that are mathematically rewritten and optimized to reduce training time.

  There are many bottlenecks that decrease the flexibility of automotive
systems, making their long-term maintenance, as well as updates and extensions
in later lifecycle phases increasingly difficult, mainly due to long

heterogeneity and numerosity of devices and underlying software components
involved. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models

increase the flexibility of automotive systems. Three case studies towards
achieving this goal are considered as outcomes of early-stage research: 1)
updates, hardware abstraction, and compliance, 2) interface compatibility
checking, and 3) architecture modification suggestions. For proof-of-concept
implementation, we rely on OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

  In many real-world scenarios, an individual's local social network carries
significant influence over the opinions they form and subsequently propagate to
others. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model -- the Pressure
Threshold model (PT) -- for dynamically simulating the spread of influence
through a social network. This new model extends the popular Linear Threshold
Model (LT) by adjusting a node's outgoing influence proportional to the
influence it receives from its activated neighbors. We address the Influence
Maximization (IM) problem, which involves selecting the most effective seed
nodes to achieve maximal graph coverage after a diffusion process, and how the
problem manifests with the PT Model. Experiments conducted on real-world
networks, facilitated by enhancements to the open-source network-diffusion
Python library, CyNetDiff, demonstrate unique seed node selection for the PT
Model when compared to the LT Model. Moreover, analyses demonstrate that
densely connected networks amplify pressure effects more significantly than
sparse networks.

\\
  Recent developments in voice cloning and talking head generation demonstrate
impressive capabilities in synthesizing natural speech and realistic lip
synchronization. Current methods typically require and are trained on large
scale datasets and computationally intensive processes using clean studio
recorded inputs that is infeasible in noisy or low resource environments. In
this paper, we introduce a new modular pipeline comprising Tortoise text to
speech. It is a transformer based latent diffusion model that can perform high
fidelity zero shot voice cloning given only a few training samples. We use a
lightweight generative adversarial network architecture for robust real time
lip synchronization. The solution will contribute to many essential tasks
concerning less reliance on massive pre training generation of emotionally
expressive speech and lip synchronization in noisy and unconstrained scenarios.
The modular structure of the pipeline allows an easy extension for future multi
modal and text guided voice modulation and it could be used in real world
systems.

  It is crucial to efficiently execute instructions such as "Find an apple and
a banana" or "Get ready for a field trip," which require searching for multiple
objects or understanding context-dependent commands. This study addresses the
challenging problem of determining which robot should be assigned to which part
of a task when each robot possesses different situational on-site
knowledge-specifically, spatial concepts learned from the area designated to it
by the user. We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions
into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel
few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from
ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our
experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments,
outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50).
Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile
manipulators. The results demonstrated that our framework could handle
instructions, including those involving ad hoc categories such as "Get ready
for a field trip," by successfully performing task decomposition, assignment,
sequential planning, and execution.

  Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) is often formulated as a machine attribute
classification task, a strategy necessitated by the common scenario where only
normal data is available for training. However, the exhaustive collection of
machine attribute labels is laborious and impractical. To address the challenge
of missing attribute labels, this paper proposes an agglomerative hierarchical
clustering method for the assignment of pseudo-attribute labels using
representations derived from a domain-adaptive pre-trained model, which are
expected to capture machine attribute characteristics. We then apply model
adaptation to this pre-trained model through supervised fine-tuning for machine
attribute classification, resulting in a new state-of-the-art performance.
Evaluation on the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events
(DCASE) 2025 Challenge dataset demonstrates that our proposed approach yields
significant performance gains, ultimately outperforming our previous
top-ranking system in the challenge.

  Interpreting the massive volume of security alerts is a significant challenge
in Security Operations Centres (SOCs). Effective contextualisation is
important, enabling quick distinction between genuine threats and benign
activity to prioritise what needs further analysis.This paper proposes a
graph-based approach to enhance alert contextualisation in a SOC by aggregating
alerts into graph-based alert groups, where nodes represent alerts and edges
denote relationships within defined time-windows. By grouping related alerts,
we enable analysis at a higher abstraction level, capturing attack steps more
effectively than individual alerts. Furthermore, to show that our format is
well suited for downstream machine learning methods, we employ Graph Matching
Networks (GMNs) to correlate incoming alert groups with historical incidents,
providing analysts with additional insights.

\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for task automation
and content generation, yet their safety mechanisms remain vulnerable to
circumvention through different jailbreaking techniques. In this paper, we
introduce \textit{Content Concretization} (CC), a novel jailbreaking technique
that iteratively transforms abstract malicious requests into concrete,
executable implementations. CC is a two-stage process: first, generating
initial LLM responses using lower-tier, less constrained safety filters models,
then refining them through higher-tier models that process both the preliminary
output and original prompt. We evaluate our technique using 350
cybersecurity-specific prompts, demonstrating substantial improvements in
jailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\% (no refinements) to 62\%
after three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\textcent~per
prompt. Comparative A/B testing across nine different LLM evaluators confirms
that outputs from additional refinement steps are consistently rated as more
malicious and technically superior. Moreover, manual code analysis reveals that
generated outputs execute with minimal modification, although optimal
deployment typically requires target-specific fine-tuning. With eventual

Title: Sy-FAR: Symmetry-based Fair Adversarial Robustness
Authors: Haneen Najjar, Eyal Ronen, Mahmood Sharif
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR cs.CV
Comments: 20 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition
systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world
physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial
robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair
robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than
from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial
robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has
focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight
is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as
face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,
leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that
seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful
as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable
because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.
Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces
symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions
where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to
encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively
evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including
against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR
significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across
runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover
in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be
classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

  In magnetically confined fusion device, the complex, multiscale, and
nonlinear dynamics of plasmas necessitate the integration of extensive
diagnostic systems to effectively monitor and control plasma behaviour. The
complexity and uncertainty arising from these extensive systems and their
tangled interrelations has long posed a significant obstacle to the
acceleration of fusion energy development. In this work, a large-scale model,
fusion masked auto-encoder (FusionMAE) is pre-trained to compress the
information from 88 diagnostic signals into a concrete embedding, to provide a
unified interface between diagnostic systems and control actuators. Two
mechanisms are proposed to ensure a meaningful embedding: compression-reduction
and missing-signal reconstruction. Upon completion of pre-training, the model
acquires the capability for 'virtual backup diagnosis', enabling the inference
of missing diagnostic data with 96.7% reliability. Furthermore, the model
demonstrates three emergent capabilities: automatic data analysis, universal
control-diagnosis interface, and enhancement of control performance on multiple
tasks. This work pioneers large-scale AI model integration in fusion energy,
demonstrating how pre-trained embeddings can simplify the system interface,
reducing necessary diagnostic systems and optimize operation performance for
future fusion reactors.

Title: Out of Distribution Detection in Self-adaptive Robots with AI-powered
  Digital Twins

  Self-adaptive robots (SARs) in complex, uncertain environments must
proactively detect and address abnormal behaviors, including
out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. To this end, digital twins offer a valuable
solution for OOD detection. Thus, we present a digital twin-based approach for
OOD detection (ODiSAR) in SARs. ODiSAR uses a Transformer-based digital twin to
forecast SAR states and employs reconstruction error and Monte Carlo dropout
for uncertainty quantification. By combining reconstruction error with
predictive variance, the digital twin effectively detects OOD behaviors, even
in previously unseen conditions. The digital twin also includes an
explainability layer that links potential OOD to specific SAR states, offering
insights for self-adaptation. We evaluated ODiSAR by creating digital twins of
two industrial robots: one navigating an office environment, and another
performing maritime ship navigation. In both cases, ODiSAR forecasts SAR
behaviors (i.e., robot trajectories and vessel motion) and proactively detects
OOD events. Our results showed that ODiSAR achieved high detection performance
-- up to 98\% AUROC, 96\% TNR@TPR95, and 95\% F1-score -- while providing
interpretable insights to support self-adaptation.

Title: Bridging Performance Gaps for Foundation Models: A Post-Training
  Strategy for ECGFounder
Authors: Ya Zhou, Yujie Yang, Xiaohan Fan and Wei Zhao
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.AP
Comments: A simple yet effective strategy for ECG foundation models
\\
  ECG foundation models are increasingly popular due to their adaptability
across various tasks. However, their clinical applicability is often limited by
performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on
large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely
due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECGFounder, a
state-of-the-art ECG foundation model pre-trained on over 7 million ECG
recordings. Experiments on the PTB-XL benchmark show that our approach improves
the baseline fine-tuning strategy by 1.2%-3.3% in macro AUROC and 5.3%-20.9% in
macro AUPRC. Additionally, our method outperforms several recent
state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced
architectures. Further evaluation reveals that our method is more stable and
sample-efficient compared to the baseline, achieving a 9.1% improvement in
macro AUROC and a 34.9% improvement in macro AUPRC using just 10% of the
training data. Ablation studies identify key components, such as stochastic
depth and preview linear probing, that contribute to the enhanced performance.
These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve
ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued
development of foundation models in the ECG domain.

  This work introduces xOffense, an AI-driven, multi-agent penetration testing
framework that shifts the process from labor-intensive, expert-driven manual
efforts to fully automated, machine-executable workflows capable of scaling
seamlessly with computational infrastructure. At its core, xOffense leverages a
fine-tuned, mid-scale open-source LLM (Qwen3-32B) to drive reasoning and
decision-making in penetration testing. The framework assigns specialized
agents to reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation, with an
orchestration layer ensuring seamless coordination across phases. Fine-tuning
on Chain-of-Thought penetration testing data further enables the model to
generate precise tool commands and perform consistent multi-step reasoning. We
evaluate xOffense on two rigorous benchmarks: AutoPenBench and
AI-Pentest-Benchmark. The results demonstrate that xOffense consistently
outperforms contemporary methods, achieving a sub-task completion rate of
79.17%, decisively surpassing leading systems such as VulnBot and PentestGPT.
These findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted mid-scale LLMs, when
embedded within structured multi-agent orchestration, to deliver superior,
cost-efficient, and reproducible solutions for autonomous penetration testing.

  The high rate of false alarms from static analysis tools and Large Language
Models (LLMs) complicates vulnerability detection in Solidity Smart Contracts,
demanding methods that can formally or empirically prove the presence of
defects. This paper introduces a novel detection pipeline that integrates
custom Slither-based detectors, LLMs, Kontrol, and Forge. Our approach is
designed to reliably detect defects and generate proofs. We currently perform
experiments with promising results for seven types of critical defects. We
demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy by presenting our findings for three
vulnerabilities -- Reentrancy, Complex Fallback, and Faulty Access Control
Policies -- that are challenging for current verification solutions, which
often generate false alarms or fail to detect them entirely. We highlight the
potential of either symbolic or concrete execution in correctly classifying
such code faults. By chaining these instruments, our method effectively
validates true positives, significantly reducing the manual verification
burden. Although we identify potential limitations, such as the inconsistency
and the cost of LLMs, our findings establish a robust framework for combining
heuristic analysis with formal verification to achieve more reliable and
automated smart contract auditing.

Title: Introducing the A2AJ's Canadian Legal Data: An open-source alternative
  to CanLII for the era of computational law
Authors: Simon Wallace and Sean Rehaag
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  The Access to Algorithmic Justice project (A2AJ) is an open-source
alternative to the Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII). At a moment
when technology promises to enable new ways of working with law, CanLII is
becoming an impediment to the free access of law and access to justice
movements because it restricts bulk and programmatic access to Canadian legal
data. This means that Canada is staring down a digital divide: well-resourced
actors have the best new technological tools and, because CanLII has disclaimed
leadership, the public only gets second-rate tools. This article puts CanLII in
its larger historical context and shows how long and deep efforts to
democratize access to Canadian legal data are, and how often they are thwarted
by private industry. We introduce the A2AJ's Canadian Legal Data project, which
provides open access to over 116,000 court decisions and 5,000 statutes through
multiple channels including APIs, machine learning datasets, and AI integration
protocols. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate how open legal data
enables courts to conduct evidence-based assessments and allows developers to
create tools for practitioners serving low-income communities.

Title: MIA-EPT: Membership Inference Attack via Error Prediction for Tabular
  Data
Authors: Eyal German, Daniel Samira, Yuval Elovici, Asaf Shabtai
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Synthetic data generation plays an important role in enabling data sharing,
particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Recent advances
in diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality
tabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive
information. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by
determining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied
in images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains
underexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited
record diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference
Attack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack
specifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs
errorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target
records, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are
predicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the
generative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to
generalize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate
MIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up
to 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests. Under the MIDST
2025 competition conditions, MIA-EPT achieved second place in the Black-box
Multi-Table track (TPR@10% FPR = 20.0%). These results demonstrate that our
method can uncover substantial membership leakage in synthetic tabular data,
challenging the assumption that synthetic data is inherently
privacy-preserving. Our code is publicly available at

Title: A Design Co-Pilot for Task-Tailored Manipulators
Authors: Jonathan K\"ulz and Sehoon Ha and Matthias Althoff
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Although robotic manipulators are used in an ever-growing range of
applications, robot manufacturers typically follow a ``one-fits-all''
philosophy, employing identical manipulators in various settings. This often
leads to suboptimal performance, as general-purpose designs fail to exploit
particularities of tasks. The development of custom, task-tailored robots is
hindered by long, cost-intensive development cycles and the high cost of
customized hardware. Recently, various computational design methods have been
devised to overcome the bottleneck of human engineering. In addition, a surge
of modular robots allows quick and economical adaptation to changing industrial
settings. This work proposes an approach to automatically designing and
optimizing robot morphologies tailored to a specific environment. To this end,
we learn the inverse kinematics for a wide range of different manipulators. A
fully differentiable framework realizes gradient-based fine-tuning of designed
robots and inverse kinematics solutions. Our generative approach accelerates
the generation of specialized designs from hours with optimization-based
methods to seconds, serving as a design co-pilot that enables instant
adaptation and effective human-AI collaboration. Numerical experiments show
that our approach finds robots that can navigate cluttered environments,
manipulators that perform well across a specified workspace, and can be adapted
to different hardware constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world
applicability of our method by setting up a modular robot designed in
simulation that successfully moves through an obstacle course.

Title: An Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer for Navigation in Dense,
  Complex Driving Scenarios
Authors: Zhihao Zhang, Chengyang Peng, Minghao Zhu, Ekim Yurtsever, Keith A.
  Redmill
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Autonomous driving in dense, dynamic environments requires decision-making
systems that can exploit both spatial structure and long-horizon temporal
dependencies while remaining robust to uncertainty. This work presents a novel
framework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with
transformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout
scenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare
safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision
Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate
per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student
model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain,
high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk
transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic
densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of
reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that
uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more
efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.

  Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely
viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a
particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex,
multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal
for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no
existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of
end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks
requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate.
We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for
realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises
three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and
Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial
analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70
professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous
multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions
spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products)
on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy.
DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that
equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves
results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact
performance significantly.By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and
providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional,
high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 15 pages, 9 figures, 1 table
\\
  We investigate individual fairness in generative probabilistic classifiers by
analysing the robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private
features. Building on established results in robustness analysis, we
hypothesise a correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy,
specifically, instances exhibiting greater robustness are more likely to be
classified accurately. We empirically assess this hypothesis using a benchmark
of fourteen datasets with fairness concerns, employing Bayesian networks as the
underlying generative models. To address the computational complexity
associated with robustness analysis over multiple private features with
Bayesian networks, we reformulate the problem as a most probable explanation
task in an auxiliary Markov random field. Our experiments confirm the
hypothesis about the correlation, suggesting novel directions to mitigate the
traditional trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Accepted by ICCV 2025
\\
  Meta-learning is a powerful paradigm for tackling few-shot tasks. However,
recent studies indicate that models trained with the whole-class training
strategy can achieve comparable performance to those trained with meta-learning
in few-shot classification tasks. To demonstrate the value of meta-learning, we
establish an entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons. Through
both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we establish that
meta-learning has a tighter generalization bound compared to whole-class
training. We unravel that meta-learning is more efficient with limited entropy
and is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks, making it
well-suited for unsupervised tasks. Based on these insights, We propose MINO, a
meta-learning framework designed to enhance unsupervised performance. MINO
utilizes the adaptive clustering algorithm DBSCAN with a dynamic head for
unsupervised task construction and a stability-based meta-scaler for robustness
against label noise. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness in
multiple unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

Title: B-TGAT: A Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer for
  Clustering Multivariate Spatiotemporal Data
Authors: Francis Ndikum Nji, Vandana Janaja, Jianwu Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 10 pages, In review
\\
  Clustering high-dimensional multivariate spatiotemporal climate data is
challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial
interactions, and non-stationary dynamics. Conventional clustering methods,
including recurrent and convolutional models, often struggle to capture both
local and global temporal relationships while preserving spatial context. We
present a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a
Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient
temporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The
encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint
spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial
correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial
details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck,
B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal
encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both
short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces
discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three
distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster
separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net
skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while
providing interpretable insights into complex spatiotemporal variability,
advancing both methodological development and climate science applications.

  A rich vehicle routing problem is considered allowing multiple trips of
heterogeneous vehicles stationed at distributed vehicle depots spread across
diverse geographies having access to different modes of transportation. The
problem arises from the real world requirement of optimizing the disaster
response/preparedness time and minimizes the route duration of the vehicles to
achieve the solution with the minimum highest-vehicle-route-duration. Multiple
diversely-functional vertices are considered including the concept of
Transhipment Ports as inter-modal resource transfer stations. Both simultaneous
and split pickup and transferring of different types of delivery and pickup
cargo is considered, along with Vehicle-Cargo and Transhipment Port-Cargo
Compatibility. The superiority of the proposed cascaded minimization approach
is shown over existing makespan minimization approaches through the developed
MILP formulation. To solve the problem quickly for practical implementation
within Disaster Management-specific Decision Support Systems, an extensive
Heuristic Algorithm is devised. The Heuristic utilizes Decision Tree based
structuring of possible routes and is able to inherently consider the
compatibility issues. Preferential generation of small route elements are
performed, which are integrated into route clusters; we consider multiple
different logical integration approaches, as well as shuffling the logics to
simultaneously produce multiple independent solutions. Finally perturbation of
the different solutions are done to find better neighbouring solutions. The
computational performance of the PSR-GIP Heuristic, on our created novel
datasets, indicate that it is able to give good solutions swiftly for practical
problems involving large integer instances which the MILP is unable to solve.

Title: Single-stream Policy Optimization
Authors: Zhongwen Xu and Zihan Ding
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from
a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce
variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent
degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder
scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which
eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a
persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across
the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.
Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in
long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.
Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive
curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO
converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while
eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm
that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and
advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM
reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the
average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial
absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25,
+4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain
in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the
prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting
a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the
next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

Title: Layout-Aware OCR for Black Digital Archives with Unsupervised Evaluation
Authors: Fitsum Sileshi Beyene and Christopher L. Dancy
Categories: cs.DL cs.AI
Comments: IEEE-ISTAS conference
\\
  Despite their cultural and historical significance, Black digital archives
continue to be a structurally underrepresented area in AI research and
infrastructure. This is especially evident in efforts to digitize historical
Black newspapers, where inconsistent typography, visual degradation, and
limited annotated layout data hinder accurate transcription, despite the
availability of various systems that claim to handle optical character
recognition (OCR) well. In this short paper, we present a layout-aware OCR
pipeline tailored for Black newspaper archives and introduce an unsupervised
evaluation framework suited to low-resource archival contexts. Our approach
integrates synthetic layout generation, model pretraining on augmented data,
and a fusion of state-of-the-art You Only Look Once (YOLO) detectors. We used
three annotation-free evaluation metrics, the Semantic Coherence Score (SCS),
Region Entropy (RE), and Textual Redundancy Score (TRS), which quantify
linguistic fluency, informational diversity, and redundancy across OCR regions.
Our evaluation on a 400-page dataset from ten Black newspaper titles
demonstrates that layout-aware OCR improves structural diversity and reduces
redundancy compared to full-page baselines, with modest trade-offs in
coherence. Our results highlight the importance of respecting cultural layout
logic in AI-driven document understanding and lay the foundation for future
community-driven and ethically grounded archival AI systems.

Title: Metacognitive Reuse: Turning Recurring LLM Reasoning Into Concise
  Behaviors
Authors: Aniket Didolkar, Nicolas Ballas, Sanjeev Arora, Anirudh Goyal
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 18 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting
extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same
intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This
saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study
a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,
reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive
analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook"
which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into
parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved
test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned
inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning
reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving
baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter
updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors
from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher
accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned
SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at
converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla
SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast
procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to
conclude.

Title: JANUS: A Dual-Constraint Generative Framework for Stealthy Node
  Injection Attacks
Authors: Jiahao Zhang and Xiaobing Pei and Zhaokun Zhong and Wenqiang Hao and
  Zhenghao Tang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial
attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks
heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original
graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness
by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental
characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local
structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,
called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local
level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve
geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate
structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the
generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the
semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a
sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning
agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS
framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack
effectiveness and stealthiness.

Title: Contrastive timbre representations for musical instrument and
  synthesizer retrieval
Authors: Gwendal Le Vaillant and Yannick Molle
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI
\\
  Efficiently retrieving specific instrument timbres from audio mixtures
remains a challenge in digital music production. This paper introduces a
contrastive learning framework for musical instrument retrieval, enabling
direct querying of instrument databases using a single model for both single-
and multi-instrument sounds. We propose techniques to generate realistic
positive/negative pairs of sounds for virtual musical instruments, such as
samplers and synthesizers, addressing limitations in common audio data
augmentation methods.
  The first experiment focuses on instrument retrieval from a dataset of 3,884
instruments, using single-instrument audio as input. Contrastive approaches are
competitive with previous works based on classification pre-training. The
second experiment considers multi-instrument retrieval with a mixture of
instruments as audio input. In this case, the proposed contrastive framework
outperforms related works, achieving 81.7\% top-1 and 95.7\% top-5 accuracies
for three-instrument mixtures.

  We give a simple, fully correct, and assumption-light replacement for the

algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows~\citep{chen2024quantum}. The published
Step~9 suffers from a periodicity/support mismatch. We present a pair-shift
difference construction that coherently cancels all unknown offsets, produces
an exact uniform CRT-coset state over $\mathbb{Z}_{P}$, and then uses the QFT
to enforce the intended modular linear relation. The unitary is reversible,
uses $\mathrm{poly}(\log M_2)$ gates, and preserves the algorithm's
asymptotics. Project Page: https://github.com/yifanzhang-pro/quantum-lattice.

Title: Context-Aware Language Models for Forecasting Market Impact from
  Sequences of Financial News
Authors: Ross Koval, Nicholas Andrews, Xifeng Yan
Categories: cs.CE cs.CL q-fin.CP
Comments: Preprint
ACM-class: I.2.7; J.4
\\
  Financial news plays a critical role in the information diffusion process in
financial markets and is a known driver of stock prices. However, the
information in each news article is not necessarily self-contained, often
requiring a broader understanding of the historical news coverage for accurate
interpretation. Further, identifying and incorporating the most relevant
contextual information presents significant challenges. In this work, we
explore the value of historical context in the ability of large language models
to understand the market impact of financial news. We find that historical
context provides a consistent and significant improvement in performance across
methods and time horizons. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective
contextualization method that uses a large LM to process the main article,
while a small LM encodes the historical context into concise summary embeddings
that are then aligned with the large model's representation space. We explore
the behavior of the model through multiple qualitative and quantitative
interpretability tests and reveal insights into the value of contextualization.
Finally, we demonstrate that the value of historical context in model
predictions has real-world applications, translating to substantial
improvements in simulated investment performance.

Title: The Adaptation Paradox: Agency vs. Mimicry in Companion Chatbots

\\
  Generative AI powers a growing wave of companion chatbots, yet principles for
fostering genuine connection remain unsettled. We test two routes: visible user
authorship versus covert language-style mimicry. In a preregistered 3x2
experiment (N = 162), we manipulated user-controlled avatar generation (none,
premade, user-generated) and Language Style Matching (LSM) (static vs.
adaptive). Generating an avatar boosted rapport ($\omega^2$ = .040, p = .013),
whereas adaptive LSM underperformed static style on personalization and
satisfaction (d = 0.35, p = .009) and was paradoxically judged less adaptive (t
= 3.07, p = .003, d = 0.48). We term this an Adaptation Paradox: synchrony
erodes connection when perceived as incoherent, destabilizing persona. To
explain, we propose a stability-and-legibility account: visible authorship
fosters natural interaction, while covert mimicry risks incoherence. Our
findings suggest designers should prioritize legible, user-driven
personalization and limit stylistic shifts rather than rely on opaque mimicry.

Title: LEAF: Knowledge Distillation of Text Embedding Models with
  Teacher-Aligned Representations
Authors: Robin Vujanic, Thomas Rueckstiess
Categories: cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: 17 pages, 12 figures
\\
  We present LEAF ("Lightweight Embedding Alignment Framework"), a knowledge
distillation framework for text embedding models. A key distinguishing feature
is that our distilled leaf models are aligned to their teacher. In the context
of information retrieval, this allows for flexible asymmetric architectures
where documents are encoded with the larger teacher model, while queries can be
served with the smaller leaf models. We also show that leaf models
automatically inherit MRL and robustness to output quantization whenever these
properties are present in the teacher model, without explicitly training for
them. To demonstrate the capability of our framework we publish leaf-ir, a 23M
parameters information retrieval oriented text embedding model trained using
LEAF, which sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on BEIR, ranking #1 on the
public leaderboard for this benchmark and for models of its size. When run in
asymmetric mode, its retrieval performance is further increased. Our scheme is
however not restricted to the information retrieval setting, and we demonstrate
its wider applicability by synthesizing the multi-task leaf-mt model. This also
sets a new SOTA, ranking #1 on the public MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard for its
size. LEAF is applicable to black-box models and in contrast to other embedding
model training frameworks, it does not require judgments nor hard negatives,
and training can be conducted using small batch sizes. Thus, dataset and
training infrastructure requirements for our framework are modest. We make our
models publicly available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.

Title: Yet Another Watermark for Large Language Models
Authors: Siyuan Bao, Ying Shi, Zhiguang Yang, Hanzhou Wu and Xinpeng Zhang
Categories: cs.CR cs.CL
Comments: https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IdiF7M0AAAAJ
\\
  Existing watermarking methods for large language models (LLMs) mainly embed
watermark by adjusting the token sampling prediction or post-processing,
lacking intrinsic coupling with LLMs, which may significantly reduce the
semantic quality of the generated marked texts. Traditional watermarking
methods based on training or fine-tuning may be extendable to LLMs. However,
most of them are limited to the white-box scenario, or very time-consuming due
to the massive parameters of LLMs. In this paper, we present a new watermarking
framework for LLMs, where the watermark is embedded into the LLM by
manipulating the internal parameters of the LLM, and can be extracted from the
generated text without accessing the LLM. Comparing with related methods, the
proposed method entangles the watermark with the intrinsic parameters of the
LLM, which better balances the robustness and imperceptibility of the
watermark. Moreover, the proposed method enables us to extract the watermark
under the black-box scenario, which is computationally efficient for use.
Experimental results have also verified the feasibility, superiority and
practicality. This work provides a new perspective different from mainstream
works, which may shed light on future research.

\\
  We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning
framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown
impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment
on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy
attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA
addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual
tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and
adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through
fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens
while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby
improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires
no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,
making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results
demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token
pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher
success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically,
LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9%
improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable
query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable
parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that
as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune
tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks
with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant
step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.

  Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading
cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging
field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet
lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,
effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway
analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus
recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel
combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,
mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.
Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by
mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN
predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple
drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible
treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater
than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing
played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating
that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key
driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted
gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.
Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective
end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible
treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.

Comments: 17 pages, 5 tables, 1 algorithm. arXiv admin note: substantial text
  overlap with arXiv:2502.20167

  We introduce a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard
softmax activation function commonly used with neural networks by adding
Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness
and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output
Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness. When used as the final-layer
activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude
(SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to
co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions,
and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the
prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of
the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among
selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective
classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the
softmax.

  Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing
objectives - factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity.
Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions, lacking
a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs. We propose a unified
evaluation framework that compares LLM alignment methods (PPO, DPO, ORPO, KTO)
across these five axes, using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
datasets. Leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt, validated through human
studies, we reveal that DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead
in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. Our findings
provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the
development of more balanced and reliable LLMs.

Title: When Inverse Data Outperforms: Exploring the Pitfalls of Mixed Data in
  Multi-Stage Fine-Tuning
Authors: Mengyi Deng, Xin Li, Tingyu Zhu, Zhicheng Yang, Zhijiang Guo, Wei Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
\\
  Existing work has shown that o1-level performance can be achieved with
limited data distillation, but most existing methods focus on unidirectional
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), overlooking the intricate interplay between
diverse reasoning patterns. In this paper, we construct r1k, a high-quality
reverse reasoning dataset derived by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k,
and examine how SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) affect alignment
under bidirectional reasoning objectives. SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8%
accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively
mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction.
Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less
preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant
outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting
supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware
alignment strategies.

Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We study how participation in collective action is articulated in podcast
discussions, using the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement as a case study. While
research on collective action discourse has primarily focused on text-based
content, this study takes a first step toward analyzing audio formats by using
podcast transcripts. Using the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC), we
investigated spoken language expressions of participation in collective action,
categorized as problem-solution, call-to-action, intention, and execution. We
identified podcast episodes discussing racial justice after important
BLM-related events in May and June of 2020, and extracted participatory
statements using a layered framework adapted from prior work on social media.
We examined the emotional dimensions of these statements, detecting eight key
emotions and their association with varying stages of activism. We found that
emotional profiles vary by stage, with different positive emotions standing out
during calls-to-action, intention, and execution. We detected negative
associations between collective action and negative emotions, contrary to
theoretical expectations. Our work contributes to a better understanding of how
activism is expressed in spoken digital discourse and how emotional framing may
depend on the format of the discussion.

  Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

Title: Neural Diffeomorphic-Neural Operator for Residual Stress-Induced
  Deformation Prediction
Authors: Changqing Liu, Kaining Dai, Zhiwei Zhao, Tianyi Wu, Yingguang Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is
essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation
often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence
vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods
for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are
computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.
Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently
solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in
accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct
application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical
limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on
diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural
operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are
explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural
network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is
then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of
deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the
diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient
prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The
proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying
geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and
multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency
across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and
features.

Title: InJecteD: Analyzing Trajectories and Drift Dynamics in Denoising
  Diffusion Probabilistic Models for 2D Point Cloud Generation
Authors: Sanyam Jain, Khuram Naveed, Illia Oleksiienko, Alexandros Iosifidis
  and Ruben Pauwels
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  This work introduces InJecteD, a framework for interpreting Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by analyzing sample trajectories during
the denoising process of 2D point cloud generation. We apply this framework to
three datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen bullseye, dino, and circle using a
simplified DDPM architecture with customizable input and time embeddings. Our
approach quantifies trajectory properties, including displacement, velocity,
clustering, and drift field dynamics, using statistical metrics such as
Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. By enhancing model transparency,
InJecteD supports human AI collaboration by enabling practitioners to debug and
refine generative models. Experiments reveal distinct denoising phases: initial
noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement, with
dataset-specific behaviors example, bullseyes concentric convergence vs. dinos
complex contour formation. We evaluate four model configurations, varying
embeddings and noise schedules, demonstrating that Fourier based embeddings
improve trajectory stability and reconstruction quality

Title: Enhancing Radiographic Disease Detection with MetaCheX, a Context-Aware
  Multimodal Model
Authors: Nathan He, Cody Chen
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: All authors contributed equally, 5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table
\\
  Existing deep learning models for chest radiology often neglect patient
metadata, limiting diagnostic accuracy and fairness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MetaCheX, a novel multimodal framework that integrates chest X-ray
images with structured patient metadata to replicate clinical decision-making.
Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone with
metadata processed by a multilayer perceptron through a shared classifier.
Evaluated on the CheXpert Plus dataset, MetaCheX consistently outperformed
radiograph-only baseline models across multiple CNN architectures. By
integrating metadata, the overall diagnostic accuracy was significantly
improved, measured by an increase in AUROC. The results of this study
demonstrate that metadata reduces algorithmic bias and enhances model
generalizability across diverse patient populations. MetaCheX advances clinical
artificial intelligence toward robust, context-aware radiographic disease
detection.

Title: Universal Gr\"obner Bases of (Universal) Multiview Ideals
Authors: Timothy Duff, Jack Kendrick, Rekha R. Thomas
Categories: math.AC cs.CV math.AG
\\
  Multiview ideals arise from the geometry of image formation in pinhole
cameras, and universal multiview ideals are their analogs for unknown cameras.
We prove that a natural collection of polynomials form a universal Gr\"obner
basis for both types of ideals using a criterion introduced by Huang and
Larson, and include a proof of their criterion in our setting. Symmetry
reduction and induction enable the method to be deployed on an infinite family
of ideals. We also give an explicit description of the matroids on which the
methodology depends, in the context of multiview ideals.

  Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for
navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in
payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like
high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous,
high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100
grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates
a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A
near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate
an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model
quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently
capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data
acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline
employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR)
approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB)
location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this
architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both
single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory
adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight
paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks
the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in
constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger
platforms.

\\
  Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in
recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate
feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its
decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering
Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers
interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth
labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled
local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic
structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with
particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks --
achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline. The code is available
at: https://github.com/maomaochongaa/iCD.

Title: Generalizable Holographic Reconstruction via Amplitude-Only Diffusion
  Priors
Authors: Jeongsol Kim, Chanseok Lee, Jong Chul Ye, and Mooseok Jang
Categories: physics.optics cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: Keywords: Diffusion model, phase retrieval, inline-holography,
  inverse problem
\\
  Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse
problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent
imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion
model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase
from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework
with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables
complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for
training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and
experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes,
imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups.
Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene
beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures,
highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a
cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in
computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent
imaging applications beyond holography.

Title: Unleashing the Power of Discrete-Time State Representation: Ultrafast
  Target-based IMU-Camera Spatial-Temporal Calibration
Authors: Junlin Song, Antoine Richard, and Miguel Olivares-Mendez
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and
autonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To
bootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal
displacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most
existing calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more
specifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise
spatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused
by continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and
extremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of
discrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time
state representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the
increasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial
platforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one
minute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total.
To benefit both the research and industry communities, our code will be
open-source.

Title: Tool-R1: Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Agentic Tool Use
Authors: Yabo Zhang, Yihan Zeng, Qingyun Li, Zhen Hu, Kavin Han, Wangmeng Zuo
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling
real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or
specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and
multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports
integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing
across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,
combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy
optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample
queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of
costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1
substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain
over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.
These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and
efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/YBYBZhang/Tool-R1.

  Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in
calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches
rely on access to large, high-quality labeled datasets for training,
benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features in the data.
Obtaining such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data
availability and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an
open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic
synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent
Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to
produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling
experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models,
QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development,
benchmarking, and quantum device research.

\\
  Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling
collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, making it
particularly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However,
resource-constrained IoT devices face significant challenges due to limited
energy,unreliable communication channels, and the impracticality of assuming
infinite blocklength transmission. This paper proposes a federated learning
framework for IoT networks that integrates finite blocklength transmission,
model quantization, and an error-aware aggregation mechanism to enhance energy
efficiency and communication reliability. The framework also optimizes uplink
transmission power to balance energy savings and model performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy
consumption by up to 75\% compared to a standard FL model, while maintaining
robust model accuracy, making it a viable solution for FL in real-world IoT
scenarios with constrained resources. This work paves the way for efficient and
reliable FL implementations in practical IoT deployments. Index Terms:

  The simulation of whole-brain dynamics should reproduce realistic spontaneous
and evoked neural activity across different scales, including emergent rhythms,
spatio-temporal activation patterns, and macroscale complexity. Once a
mathematical model is selected, its configuration must be determined by
properly setting its parameters. A critical preliminary step in this process is
defining an appropriate set of observables to guide the selection of model
configurations (parameter tuning), laying the groundwork for quantitative
calibration of accurate whole-brain models. Here, we address this challenge by
presenting a framework that integrates two complementary tools: The Virtual
Brain (TVB) platform for simulating whole-brain dynamics, and the Collaborative
Brain Wave Analysis Pipeline (Cobrawap) for analyzing the simulations using a
set of standardized metrics. We apply this framework to a 998-node human
connectome, using two configurations of the Larter-Breakspear neural mass
model: one with the TVB default parameters, the other tuned using Cobrawap. The
results reveal that the tuned configuration exhibits several biologically
relevant features, absent in the default model for both spontaneous and evoked
dynamics. In response to external perturbations, the tuned model generates
non-stereotyped, complex spatio-temporal activity, as measured by the
perturbational complexity index. In spontaneous activity, it displays robust
alpha-band oscillations, infra-slow rhythms, scale-free characteristics,
greater spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and asymmetric functional connectivity.
This work demonstrates the potential of combining TVB and Cobrawap to guide
parameter tuning and lays the groundwork for data-driven calibration and
validation of accurate whole-brain models.

  The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has opened new
opportunities for education. While learners can interact with academic papers
through LLM-powered dialogue, limitations still exist: absence of structured
organization and high text reliance can impede systematic understanding and
engagement with complex concepts. To address these challenges, we propose
Auto-Slides, an LLM-driven system that converts research papers into
pedagogically structured, multimodal slides (e.g., diagrams and tables).
Drawing on cognitive science, it creates a presentation-oriented narrative and
allows iterative refinement via an interactive editor, in order to match
learners' knowledge level and goals. Auto-Slides further incorporates
verification and knowledge retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and
contextual completeness. Through extensive user studies, Auto-Slides enhances
learners' comprehension and engagement compared to conventional LLM-based
reading. Our contributions lie in designing a multi-agent framework for
transforming academic papers into pedagogically optimized slides and
introducing interactive customization for personalized learning.

  In volatile financial markets, balancing risk and return remains a
significant challenge. Traditional approaches often focus solely on equity
allocation, overlooking the strategic advantages of options trading for dynamic
risk hedging. This work presents DeltaHedge, a multi-agent framework that
integrates options trading with AI-driven portfolio management. By combining
advanced reinforcement learning techniques with an ensembled options-based
hedging strategy, DeltaHedge enhances risk-adjusted returns and stabilizes
portfolio performance across varying market conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate that DeltaHedge outperforms traditional strategies and standalone
models, underscoring its potential to transform practical portfolio management
in complex financial environments. Building on these findings, this paper
contributes to the fields of quantitative finance and AI-driven portfolio
optimization by introducing a novel multi-agent system for integrating options
trading strategies, addressing a gap in the existing literature.
