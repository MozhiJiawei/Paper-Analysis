Title: AI Agents for the Dhumbal Card Game: A Comparative Study
Authors: Sahaj Raj Malla
Categories: cs.AI cs.GT cs.LG
Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables
MSC-class: 91A68
ACM-class: I.2.1; I.2.6

  This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,
thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural
games.

Title: Beyond Consensus: Mitigating the Agreeableness Bias in LLM Judge
  Evaluations
Authors: Suryaansh Jain, Umair Z. Ahmed, Shubham Sahai, Ben Leong
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

  AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

Title: CGBench: Benchmarking Language Model Scientific Reasoning for Clinical
  Genetics Research
Authors: Owen Queen, Harrison G. Zhang, James Zou
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Accepted at NeurIPS 2025
\\
  Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

Title: Asking Clarifying Questions for Preference Elicitation With Large
  Language Models
Authors: Ali Montazeralghaem and Guy Tennenholtz and Craig Boutilier and Ofer
  Meshi
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

Title: CausalTrace: A Neurosymbolic Causal Analysis Agent for Smart
  Manufacturing

  Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live
deployment.

Title: Do Large Language Models Respect Contracts? Evaluating and Enforcing
  Contract-Adherence in Code Generation
Authors: Soohan Lim, Joonghyuk Hahn, Hyunwoo Park, Sang-Ki Ko, Yo-Sub Han

Comments: 21 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables

\\
  Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

Title: Empowering LLM Agents with Geospatial Awareness: Toward Grounded
  Reasoning for Wildfire Response
Authors: Yiheng Chen, Lingyao Li, Zihui Ma, Qikai Hu, Yilun Zhu, Min Deng,
  Runlong Yu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

Title: ThinkPilot: Steering Reasoning Models via Automated Think-prefixes
  Optimization
Authors: Sunzhu Li, Zhiyu Lin, Shuling Yang, Jiale Zhao, Wei Chen
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

Title: AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers
Authors: Alessandro Achille, Stefano Soatto
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

\\
  Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

  Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

Title: BeSTAD: Behavior-Aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
  Mobility Data

Comments: accepted by The 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on
  Geospatial Anomaly Detection
DOI: 10.1145/3764914.3770888
\\
  Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

Title: Evaluating the Quality of Randomness and Entropy in Tasks Supported by
  Large Language Models
Authors: Rabimba Karanjai, Yang Lu, Ranjith Chodavarapu, Lei Xu, Weidong Shi
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Title: One Life to Learn: Inferring Symbolic World Models for Stochastic
  Environments from Unguided Exploration

\\
  Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

  Simulations

Categories: cs.AI cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.soft
Comments: 10 pages, 8 figures
\\
  We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

  Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

  This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language
Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA
models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

Title: ResearStudio: A Human-Intervenable Framework for Building Controllable
  Deep-Research Agents
Authors: Linyi Yang and Yixuan Weng
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: EMNLP 2025 Demo, Oral
\\
  Current deep-research agents run in a ''fire-and-forget'' mode: once started,
they give users no way to fix errors or add expert knowledge during execution.
We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time
human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design.
A hierarchical Planner-Executor writes every step to a live
''plan-as-document,'' a fast communication layer streams each action, file
change, and tool call to a web interface. At any moment, the user can pause the
run, edit the plan or code, run custom commands, and resume -- switching
smoothly between AI-led, human-assisted and human-led, AI-assisted modes. In
fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the
GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These
results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control
can coexist. The full code, protocol, and evaluation scripts are available at
https://github.com/ResearAI/ResearStudio. We will continue to update the
repository to encourage further work on safe and controllable research agents.
Our live demo is publicly accessible at http://ai-researcher.net:3000/. We
support the development of DeepScientist, which can be accessed at

Title: On the Design and Evaluation of Human-centered Explainable AI Systems: A
  Systematic Review and Taxonomy
Authors: Aline Mangold, Juliane Zietz, Susanne Weinhold, Sebastian Pannasch
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

Title: GOAT: A Training Framework for Goal-Oriented Agent with Tools
Authors: Hyunji Min, Sangwon Jung, Junyoung Sung, Dosung Lee, Leekyeung Han,

Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 32 pages, 21 figures
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

Title: MedKGEval: A Knowledge Graph-Based Multi-Turn Evaluation Framework for
  Open-Ended Patient Interactions with Clinical LLMs
Authors: Yuechun Yu, Han Ying, Haoan Jin, Wenjian Jiang, Dong Xian, Binghao
  Wang, Zhou Yang, Mengyue Wu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

Title: PromptFlow: Training Prompts Like Neural Networks
Authors: Jingyi Wang, Hongyuan Zhu, Ye Niu, Yunhui Deng
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Comments: 18 pages, 14 figures, conference submission, appendix
  included
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

Title: $\mathbf{T^3}$: Reducing Belief Deviation in Reinforcement Learning for
  Active Reasoning
Authors: Deyu Zou, Yongqiang Chen, Jianxiang Wang, Haochen Yang, Mufei Li,
  James Cheng, Pan Li, Yu Gong
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

  Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

Title: RAG-Anything: All-in-One RAG Framework
Authors: Zirui Guo, Xubin Ren, Lingrui Xu, Jiahao Zhang, Chao Huang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

Authors: Ayush Khaitan and Vijay Ganesh
Categories: cs.AI
MSC-class: 03B35, 68W30, 68T05
\\
  Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

  The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

  We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule

  Exploring Echo Chamber Dynamics
Authors: Dingyi Zuo and Hongjie Zhang and Jie Ou and Chaosheng Feng and Shuwan

Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 14 pages, 11figures
\\
  The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

Title: Biased-Attention Guided Risk Prediction for Safe Decision-Making at
  Unsignalized Intersections
Authors: Chengyang Dong, Nan Guo
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is
available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.

Title: Evaluating and Mitigating LLM-as-a-judge Bias in Communication Systems
Authors: Jiaxin Gao, Chen Chen, Yanwen Jia, Xueluan Gong, Kwok-Yan Lam, Qian
  Wang
Categories: cs.AI cs.CR
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

Title: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells: From Measurements to Decisions
  across Modality, Scale, Dynamics, and Evaluation
Authors: Chengpeng Hu, Calvin Yu-Chian Chen
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

Title: ProtoSiTex: Learning Semi-Interpretable Prototypes for Multi-label Text
  Classification
Authors: Utsav Kumar Nareti, Suraj Kumar, Soumya Pandey, Soumi Chattopadhyay,
  Chandranath Adak
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

Title: Inclusive Fitness as a Key Step Towards More Advanced Social Behaviors
  in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Settings
Authors: Andries Rosseau, Rapha\"el Avalos, Ann Now\'e
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA cs.SI
Comments: This version is a slightly updated version (e.g., added an important
  reference) compared to the peer-reviewed versions at 'Adapative Learning
  Agents' at AAMAS 2022 or 'From Cells to Societies' at ICLR 2022
\\
  The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

Title: HardcoreLogic: Challenging Large Reasoning Models with Long-tail Logic
  Puzzle Games
Authors: Jingcong Liang, Shijun Wan, Xuehai Wu, Siyuan Wang, Yitong Li,
  Qianglong Chen, Duyu Tang, Zhongyu Wei
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

Title: Memory as Action: Autonomous Context Curation for Long-Horizon Agentic
  Tasks
Authors: Yuxiang Zhang, Jiangming Shu, Ye Ma, Xueyuan Lin, Shangxi Wu, Jitao
  Sang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

  Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

Title: Multi-Agent Debate for LLM Judges with Adaptive Stability Detection
Authors: Tianyu Hu, Zhen Tan, Song Wang, Huaizhi Qu, Tianlong Chen
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

  Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

Title: Towards Robust Artificial Intelligence: Self-Supervised Learning
  Approach for Out-of-Distribution Detection

  Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =
0.99.

Title: Clutch Control: An Attention-based Combinatorial Bandit for Efficient
  Mutation in JavaScript Engine Fuzzing
Authors: Myles Foley, Sergio Maffeis, Muhammad Fakhrur Rozi, Takeshi Takahashi
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

Title: CTRL-Rec: Controlling Recommender Systems With Natural Language

Categories: cs.AI cs.IR
\\
  When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

  We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.

  Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear
adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning
underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently
rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When
puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a
striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?
To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general
way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these
things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25
well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve
reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate
eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom
recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious
rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this
issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to
detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error
categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these
categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models
significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom
recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs
often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap
between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

Authors: Kai Mei, Jiang Guo, Shuaichen Chang, Mingwen Dong, Dongkyu Lee, Xing
  Niu, Jiarong Jiang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent
decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and
predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error
exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'
tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,
which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To
systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we
probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward
estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure
planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows
that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify
meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in
full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling
environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we
propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM
simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from
external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial
improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to
baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

Title: LLM Knowledge is Brittle: Truthfulness Representations Rely on
  Superficial Resemblance
Authors: Patrick Haller, Mark Ibrahim, Polina Kirichenko, Levent Sagun, and
  Samuel J. Bell
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust
knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike
those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM
performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to
trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is
a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this
question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode
statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily
separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of
learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that
have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution
(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving
perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more
OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge
probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement
truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to
those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true
and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this
ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These
findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs
may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only
limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the
utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on
improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

Title: LLM Reasoning for Machine Translation: Synthetic Data Generation over
  Thinking Tokens
Authors: Armel Zebaze, Rachel Bawden, Beno\^it Sagot
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of
problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process
prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across
mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation
(MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the
generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language
pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that
"thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes
to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of
thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically,
fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate
step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However,
constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular
translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings
underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning
highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More
broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations
or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT
explanations into "thinking" MT models.

divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in
childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual
QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of
bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We
further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In
all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development
of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation
helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which
enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the
performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale
corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements.
Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language
instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal
mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a
framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources
for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and
dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that
structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code
data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human
annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and
evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign
provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77%
on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical
knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10
and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code
data is beneficial even for specialized models.

Title: GRAVITY: A Framework for Personalized Text Generation via
  Profile-Grounded Synthetic Preferences
Authors: Priyanka Dey, Daniele Rosa, Wenqing Zheng, Daniel Barcklow, Jieyu

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction
logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the
reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with
Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating
synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests,
values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural,
and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions,
Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits --
GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation.
We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to
prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair
generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation,
especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over
4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that
GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that
scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce
reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered
content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

Title: Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems on Unanswerable,
  Uncheatable, Realistic, Multi-hop Queries
Authors: Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu, Bryan Li, Arman Cohan, William Gantt Walden,
  Eugene Yang
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
\\
  Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which
relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these
settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries
and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this,
existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop
or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected
reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only
simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover
limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first
pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of
un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable,
and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs),
adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over
two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark
experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to
prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve
up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline
offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive
development of more capable RAG systems.

Title: Direct Multi-Token Decoding
Authors: Xuan Luo, Weizhi Wang, Xifeng Yan
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large
language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest
that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct
roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers
handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract
representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations
have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states
may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple
tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse
the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct
Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces
no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification.
Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model
has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with
only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its
performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

Authors: Weiwei Sun, Miao Lu, Zhan Ling, Kang Liu, Xuesong Yao, Yiming Yang,

Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context
length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that
empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can
procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it
upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise
summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process
rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On
complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches
or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$
smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based
context management.

Title: Conjecturing: An Overlooked Step in Formal Mathematical Reasoning
Authors: Jasivan Alex Sivakumar, Philipp Borchert, Ronald Cardenas, Gerasimos
  Lampouras
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in
formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,
however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical
problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion
such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models
(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their
conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or
proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this
gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the
evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing
capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation
pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is
substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during
evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We
design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and
autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first
successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1
and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite
knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation
performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and
investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.
Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward
improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

Title: SAGE: A Top-Down Bottom-Up Knowledge-Grounded User Simulator for
  Multi-turn AGent Evaluation
Authors: Ryan Shea, Yunan Lu, Liang Qiu, Zhou Yu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for
human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an
alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and
overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior.
We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent
Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates
top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles,
grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate
bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product
catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate
interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a
company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this
approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also
identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an
evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.

Title: Generate Logical Equivalence Questions
Authors: Xinyu Wang, Haoming Yu, Yicheng Yang, Zhiyuan Li
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet
plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and
learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to
mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally,
AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on
generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a
foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature
review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all
propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies
and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new
approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language,
translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a
linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two
experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions
generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these
questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment
assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions,
textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The
results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of
textbook questions, confirming the quality of our AQG.

  The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on
large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building
symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS)
and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine
interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system
outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where
total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details.
However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime,
greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks
generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant
resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher
performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime,
limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings
highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world
applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and
control.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency
in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes
generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A
frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly
structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed
rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these
ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a
plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans
ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions
to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small
language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR
significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating
hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves
over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

  Language Models

\\
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However,
LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models
generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute
to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous
wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under
explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a
framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across
multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation,
typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models
(SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of
prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with
ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on
hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\%
win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we
reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation
frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and
adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide
range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text
summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised
concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to
hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs.
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to
address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the
trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations
of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between
epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have
been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of
UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a
mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We
systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple
dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches.
Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research
directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for
hallucination detection.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified
prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality.
We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our
approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct
preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to
enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our
method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt
rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and
aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone
generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also
systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with
the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight
that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic
strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained
prompt rewriters soon.

Title: Hierarchical Alignment: Surgical Fine-Tuning via Functional Layer
  Specialization in Large Language Models
Authors: Yukun Zhang, and Qi Dong
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic
entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach
overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture,
where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to
abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm
by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO
to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate
(logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for
surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge,
demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning
the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly,
aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency
as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing
logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical
strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO,
where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These
findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable
path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from
monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more
advanced and reliable LLMs.

\\
  Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing
two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic
self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length
increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that
transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length.
Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we
surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to
synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the
ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative
for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware
solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional
semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on
the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA
environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment
systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par
summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a
fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and
self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire
further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards
other relevant long-context tasks.

  Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering
harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study
evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets:
the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and
the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental
health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we
evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out
comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation
guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF
demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis
Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in
detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939,
sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in
identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis
AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive
(0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared
with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF
demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving
significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher
specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni
Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest
exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with
sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF
demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to
minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

  The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain,
though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often
impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we
propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate
their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a
straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong
correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho =
0.739$, $p < 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A
comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals
that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human
performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore,
linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of
decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a
greater diversity of associative patterns.

Title: Tracing Multilingual Knowledge Acquisition Dynamics in Domain
  Adaptation: A Case Study of English-Japanese Biomedical Adaptation
Authors: Xin Zhao, Naoki Yoshinaga, Yuma Tsuta, Akiko Aizawa
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 22 Pages, Submitted to ARR 2025 Oct
\\
  Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain
knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many
methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of
multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a
language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work
examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA
studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge
coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds
multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for
training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through
continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire
domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from

Title: Understanding the Modality Gap: An Empirical Study on the Speech-Text
  Alignment Mechanism of Large Speech Language Models
Authors: Bajian Xiang, Shuaijiang Zhao, Tingwei Guo, Wei Zou
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)
\\
  End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive
conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional
pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal
through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input
performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between
speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality
gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and
speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech
and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction
(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean
distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly
correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous
token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is
observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify
token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the
modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on
critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These
strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.
Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap
and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological
guidance for future optimization.

\\
  With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety
issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more
common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts;
however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To
encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in
multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues
of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This
benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different
scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index
(SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess
the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of
successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful
dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these
models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We
propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent
concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety
policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that
this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed
guard models.

Title: Credal Transformer: A Principled Approach for Quantifying and Mitigating
  Hallucinations in Large Language Models
Authors: Shihao Ji, Zihui Song, Jiajie Huang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet
confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax
function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous
attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty
information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,
which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based
on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions)
instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring
model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as
evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers
standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,
representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies
out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces
confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a
new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that
integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a
foundation for more reliable AI.

  With the increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), parallel
reasoning has emerged as a new inference paradigm that enhances reasoning
robustness by concurrently exploring multiple lines of thought before
converging on a final answer. It has become a significant trend to explore
parallel reasoning to overcome the fragility of standard sequential methods and
improve practical performance. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize
the progress and challenges of parallel reasoning. We first present a formal
definition of parallel reasoning and clarify its distinction from related
concepts like Chain-of-Thought. Then, we organize and discuss advanced
techniques based on a novel taxonomy, including non-interactive reasoning,
interactive reasoning, and efficiency-focused decoding strategies.
Additionally, we explore various application scenarios, such as solving complex
problems and enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.Finally, we highlight the
core challenges of parallel reasoning and suggest potential directions for
future research. We hope that our work can provide a useful roadmap for
beginners and encourage more research on improving parallel reasoning methods.

Title: Towards Inference-time Scaling for Continuous Space Reasoning
Authors: Minghan Wang, Thuy-Trang Vu, Ehsan Shareghi, Gholamreza Haffari
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with
Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective
for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates
whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in
the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space
reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating
diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on
the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant
gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we
highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous
thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training
PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in
the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric
properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that
prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning
(essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that
current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous
thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous
reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly
incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for
discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data
will be publicly available.}

  Concept Representation for Drug Repurposing

  Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery,
especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs),
which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support
this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical
concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating
that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To
address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework
for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts
within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related
textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models
(LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By
injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the
representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of
under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks
demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different
scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its
robustness and effectiveness. Code is available at

Authors: Jiayu Yao, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Rundong Cheng, Lingrui Mei,

Categories: cs.CL cs.SD
\\
  Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio
understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events
occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal
bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For
example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key
formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or
later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped
datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and
models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds
in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We
quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic
misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization
framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and
call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

Title: DPO-Tuned Large Language Models for Segmentation in Simultaneous Speech
  Translation
Authors: Zeyu Yang and Satoshi Nakamura
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance
translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced
pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic
rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more
robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning
objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial
for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation
framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs
to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of
real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across
three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2
as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM
achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent
improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average
Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct
comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to
surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,
human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

Title: HALF: Harm-Aware LLM Fairness Evaluation Aligned with Deployment
Authors: Ali Mekky, Omar El Herraoui, Preslav Nakov, Yuxia Wang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact
domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and
education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical.
However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not
account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery
should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To
address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a
deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications
and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application
domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline.
Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not
consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not
guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision
support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap
between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

Title: Analysing Moral Bias in Finetuned LLMs through Mechanistic
  Interpretability
Authors: Bianca Raimondi, Daniela Dalbagno, Maurizio Gabbrielli
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Preprint. Under review
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases
during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain
unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a
moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether
it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a
Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the
bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set
of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the
corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to
eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in
LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted
interventions, without the need for model retraining.

Title: DSAS: A Universal Plug-and-Play Framework for Attention Optimization in
  Multi-Document Question Answering
Authors: Jiakai Li, Rongzheng Wang, Yizhuo Ma, Shuang Liang, Guangchun Luo, Ke

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 27 pages, has been accepted by NeurIPS 2025
\\
  While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various
fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question
answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency
modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which
weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the
''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information
in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global
dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and
simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose
Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The
Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by
assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and
position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)
module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information
exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in
long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play
solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across
mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score
improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of
both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix
further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

  Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical
use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains
poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn
question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of
medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and
authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for
systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.
Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading
initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are
challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that
separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).
Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under
shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn
settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude
Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often
more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across
models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment.
Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing
additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others
partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn
robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable
deployment of medical LLMs.

Title: Chinese ModernBERT with Whole-Word Masking

\\
  Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture,
data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory
efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where
tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese
ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware
32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the
embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking
curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii)
a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to
8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a
damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We
pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and
Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong
Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves
high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed,
reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe
retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data:
fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking
(~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set.
Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding
on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated
pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible
research.

Title: A large-scale, unsupervised pipeline for automatic corpus annotation
  using LLMs: variation and change in the English consider construction
Authors: Cameron Morin and Matti Marttinen Larsson
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual
annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic
work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline
for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large
language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches,
our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc
evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate
the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study
of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the
OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical
American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two
sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform
a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention,
opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation
requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

Title: Beating Harmful Stereotypes Through Facts: RAG-based Counter-speech
  Generation
Authors: Greta Damo, Elena Cabrio, Serena Villata
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as
fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work
treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on
Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks
due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text,
and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel
framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation
process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main
target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people
of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons,
and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library,
EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792
texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality
of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM)
and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard
LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting
framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and
sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human
brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language
processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify
the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to
study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the
relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our
findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP
exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA
prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted
recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to
human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance
between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly
applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse
language processing tasks.

Title: MoBiLE: Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Inference on Consumer GPU with
  Mixture of Big Little Experts
Authors: Yushu Zhao, Yubin Qin, Yang Wang, Xiaolong Yang, Huiming Han, Shaojun
  Wei, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to ASP-DAC 2026
\\
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional
performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse
activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active
experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU
DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by
the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck,
existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference.
These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using
specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered
by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on
recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE
inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the
number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while
maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality.
Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for
switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We
evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging
generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to
1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible
degradation in accuracy.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow,
potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous
studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review,
their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between
research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this
study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and
research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential
risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a
research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent,
which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct
human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based
reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores
for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than
human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored
papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple
revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM
reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and
an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and
equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are
deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand,
revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human

Title: Tokenization Disparities as Infrastructure Bias: How Subword Systems
  Create Inequities in LLM Access and Efficiency

  Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable
access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations.
This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization
efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational
inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental
framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols,
followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all
language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using
established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and
Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our
cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities:
Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency,
while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly
greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These
inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced
effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the
findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers
of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational
disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of
linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary
construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more
inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

Title: PRoH: Dynamic Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs for
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Authors: Xiangjun Zai, Xingyu Tan, Xiaoyang Wang, Qing Liu, Xiwei Xu, Wenjie

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge
representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to
model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based
RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning,
non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and
semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop
question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic
Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates
three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the
local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation;
(ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as
a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive,
multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided
reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent
hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model
HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation
(G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop
reasoning tasks.

Title: Probing Latent Knowledge Conflict for Faithful Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG
systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response
contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to
improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such
as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These
works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does
the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,
particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a
probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe
three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest
as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often
amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,
we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a
framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level
knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,
and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to
accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three
benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and
contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under
diverse conflict conditions. The related resources are available at

Title: Resource-sensitive but language-blind: Community size and not
  grammatical complexity better predicts the accuracy of Large Language Models
  in a novel Wug Test
Authors: Nikoleta Pantelidou, Evelina Leivada, Paolo Morosi
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing
debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model
performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.
Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across
four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and
compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy
approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic
complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with
previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize
morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,
accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability
than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In
particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital
representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than
less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that
model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather
than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance
that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

Title: SMEC: Rethinking Matryoshka Representation Learning for Retrieval
  Embedding Compression
Authors: Biao Zhang, Lixin Chen, Tong Liu, Bo Zheng
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: Accepted by EMNLP2025
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that
capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional
embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements,
thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression
(SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation
Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the
Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation
during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module
to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings.
Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC
achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance.
For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of
compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points
compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

Title: When Personalization Tricks Detectors: The Feature-Inversion Trap in
  Machine-Generated Text Detection
Authors: Lang Gao, Xuhui Li, Chenxi Wang, Mingzhe Li, Wei Liu, Zirui Song,

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation,
producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also
heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In
this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector
robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired
with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large
performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some
state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation
to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative
in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized
text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to
predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method
identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs
probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector
dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the
direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation
with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further
research on personalized text detection.

  Stomach Annotation Disagreements (Yet)
Authors: Tomas Ruiz, Siyao Peng, Barbara Plank, Carsten Schwemmer
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at
inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge,
test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers,
like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025
tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time
scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority
Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM
performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does
not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently
transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for
this gap.

Title: VISaGE: Understanding Visual Generics and Exceptions
Authors: Stella Frank and Emily Allaway
Categories: cs.CL cs.CV
Comments: EMNLP 2025
\\
  While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the
form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to
analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this
paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a
pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising
from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that
the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category.
In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new
evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images.
In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding
degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is
violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of
the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

Title: Teaching Language Models to Faithfully Express their Uncertainty
Authors: Bryan Eikema, Evgenia Ilia, Jos\'e G. C. de Souza, Chrysoula Zerva and
  Wilker Aziz
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) often miscommunicate their uncertainty: repeated
queries can produce divergent answers, yet generated responses are typically
unhedged or hedged in ways that do not reflect this variability. This conveys
unfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge,
creating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce
Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches
instruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their
underlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model
samples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or
'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the
model and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering
(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT
substantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and
introducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate
robustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of
uncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a
simple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.

  with Stylistic Analysis
Authors: Siyuan Li, Aodu Wulianghai, Xi Lin, Guangyan Li, Xiang Chen, Jun Wu,
  Jianhua Li
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into
open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical
task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on
statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between
LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in
real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to
paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic
diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose
StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits
LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify
stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and
continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,
StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and
LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables
accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access
to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five
diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,
demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain
accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing
baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial
perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative
analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for
distinguishing machine-generated text. Our source code can be accessed at

large-scale proprietary models. Experimental results demonstrate that
fine-tuning on ACAD-TRAIN leads to improvements in academic translation quality
by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively,
while also improving long-context translation in a general domain by up to
24.9% when translating out of English. The fine-tuned top-performing model

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and
making optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent,
high-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt
engineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands
for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the
'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR
framework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its
performance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models,
particularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs.
Through a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most
8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance
the output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks,
although its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the
Llama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with
COSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability
and scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in
computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

Title: Reasoning Pattern Matters: Learning to Reason without Human Rationales
Authors: Chaoxu Pang, Yixuan Cao, Ping Luo
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Submitted to Frontiers of Computer Science
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories
(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model
using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating
high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This
paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially
reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class
of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,
procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in
content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the
solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the
success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable
models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic
matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral
evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of
rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,
we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with
task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.
Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR
performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest
that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based
automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning
patterns.

Title: Generation Space Size: Understanding and Calibrating Open-Endedness of
  LLM Generations
Authors: Sunny Yu, Ahmad Jabbar, Robert Hawkins, Dan Jurafsky, Myra Cheng
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output
diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to
overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but
incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes
are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective
generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model
considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with
ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where
models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection
metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity
and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,
providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.
We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and
predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting
overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to
expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

  Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing
human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni
Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in
parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer
understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe
fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a
systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the
perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an
inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To
address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline
integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally
hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,
we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed
perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the
cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on
MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and
delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed
captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and
achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the
video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni
detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for
detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,
efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality
detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such
detailed captions.

Title: Which Word Orders Facilitate Length Generalization in LMs? An
  Investigation with GCG-Based Artificial Languages
Authors: Nadine El-Naggar, Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Ted Briscoe
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: EMNLP 2025 Main Conference
\\
  Whether language models (LMs) have inductive biases that favor typologically
frequent grammatical properties over rare, implausible ones has been
investigated, typically using artificial languages (ALs) (White and Cotterell,
2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2024). In this paper, we extend these works from two
perspectives. First, we extend their context-free AL formalization by adopting
Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) (Wood, 2014), which allows ALs to cover
attested but previously overlooked constructions, such as unbounded dependency
and mildly context-sensitive structures. Second, our evaluation focuses more on
the generalization ability of LMs to process unseen longer test sentences.
Thus, our ALs better capture features of natural languages and our experimental
paradigm leads to clearer conclusions -- typologically plausible word orders
tend to be easier for LMs to productively generalize.

  Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not
trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics
remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to
assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,
Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)
generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue
and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined
sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and
enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we
find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect
enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference
when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although
instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects
a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

Title: Language Models Model Language
Authors: {\L}ukasz Borchmann
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Linguistic commentary on LLMs, heavily influenced by the theoretical
frameworks of de Saussure and Chomsky, is often speculative and unproductive.
Critics challenge whether LLMs can legitimately model language, citing the need
for "deep structure" or "grounding" to achieve an idealized linguistic
"competence." We argue for a radical shift in perspective towards the
empiricist principles of Witold Ma\'nczak, a prominent general and historical
linguist. He defines language not as a "system of signs" or a "computational
system of the brain" but as the totality of all that is said and written. Above
all, he identifies frequency of use of particular language elements as
language's primary governing principle. Using his framework, we challenge prior
critiques of LLMs and provide a constructive guide for designing, evaluating,
and interpreting language models.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a
transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and
insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning.
Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on
costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining,
and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce
Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that
equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip,
execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision:
using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer
configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our
design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing,
and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long
sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to
+3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to
out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA,
AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and
outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that
explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware,
accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.

Title: Cost Analysis of Human-corrected Transcription for Predominately Oral
  Languages

Comments: 6 pages, 1 figure
\\
  Creating speech datasets for low-resource languages is a critical yet poorly
understood challenge, particularly regarding the actual cost in human labor.
This paper investigates the time and complexity required to produce
high-quality annotated speech data for a subset of low-resource languages, low
literacy Predominately Oral Languages, focusing on Bambara, a Manding language
of Mali. Through a one-month field study involving ten transcribers with native
proficiency, we analyze the correction of ASR-generated transcriptions of 53
hours of Bambara voice data. We report that it takes, on average, 30 hours of
human labor to accurately transcribe one hour of speech data under laboratory
conditions and 36 hours under field conditions. The study provides a baseline
and practical insights for a large class of languages with comparable profiles
undertaking the creation of NLP resources.

  As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

Comments: EMNLP 2025 Findings
\\
  CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited

  Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

Title: PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline
  Transformation
Authors: Hatem Ibrahem, Ahmed Salem, Qinmin Vivian Hu, Guanghui Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,

  Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

Title: Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging
Authors: Leili Barekatain and Ben Glocker
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at Workshop on Interpretability of Machine Intelligence in
  Medical Image Computing at MICCAI 2025
\\
  Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

Title: APGNet: Adaptive Prior-Guided for Underwater Camouflaged Object
  Detection
Authors: Xinxin Huang, Han Sun, Junmin Cai, Ningzhong Liu, Huiyu Zhou
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 6 pages. accepted by ACM MM Asia 2025
\\
  Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

Title: VIDMP3: Video Editing by Representing Motion with Pose and Position
  Priors
Authors: Sandeep Mishra, Oindrila Saha, Alan C. Bovik
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made

where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which

\\
  Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

multimodal data export capabilities, including point clouds, 3D bounding boxes,
multiview images, depth maps, normal maps, and semantic masks, enabling
seamless adaptation to various visual tasks. As a versatile and robust

Title: An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion
  Deblurring
Authors: Jianping Li, Dongyang Guo, Wenjie Li, Wei Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

Comments: Project page: https://dali-jack.github.io/g4splat-web/
\\
  Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

\\
  With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

Title: Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion Model for Old-Photo Face
  Restoration
Authors: Wenjie Li, Xiangyi Wang, Heng Guo, Guangwei Gao, Zhanyu Ma
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

Comments: Accepted at NeurIPS 2025
\\
  The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

  Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

  Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Title: FedHUG: Federated Heterogeneous Unsupervised Generalization for Remote
  Physiological Measurements
Authors: Xiao Yang and Jiyao Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

Title: Class-aware Domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission for Continual Test-Time
  Adaptation
Authors: Jiahuan Zhou and Chao Zhu and Zhenyu Cui and Zichen Liu and Xu Zou and
  Gang Hua
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

Title: DPL: Spatial-Conditioned Diffusion Prototype Enhancement for One-Shot
  Medical Segmentation
Authors: Ziyuan Gao and Philippe Morel
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at IVCNZ 2025. To be published in IEEE proceedings
\\
  One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

Title: State Space Prompting via Gathering and Spreading Spatio-Temporal
  Information for Video Understanding
Authors: Jiahuan Zhou and Kai Zhu and Zhenyu Cui and Zichen Liu and Xu Zou and
  Gang Hua
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Title: UniGS: Unified Geometry-Aware Gaussian Splatting for Multimodal
  Rendering
Authors: Yusen Xie, Zhenmin Huang, Jianhao Jiao, Dimitrios Kanoulas and Jun Ma
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and
differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based
on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.
Source code and multimodal viewer will be available on GitHub.

Title: BEEP3D: Box-Supervised End-to-End Pseudo-Mask Generation for 3D Instance
  Segmentation
Authors: Youngju Yoo, Seho Kim, Changick Kim
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Title: CompoDistill: Attention Distillation for Compositional Reasoning in
  Multimodal LLMs
Authors: Jiwan Kim, Kibum Kim, Sangwoo Seo, Chanyoung Park
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: Preprint. Under Review
\\
  Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 2nd Place Winner, ICCV 2025 2COOOL Competition
\\
  Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

  Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Title: DIANet: A Phase-Aware Dual-Stream Network for Micro-Expression
  Recognition via Dynamic Images
Authors: Vu Tram Anh Khuong, Luu Tu Nguyen, Thi Bich Phuong Man, Thanh Ha Le,
  Thi Duyen Ngo
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

\\
  Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Title: BIGFix: Bidirectional Image Generation with Token Fixing
Authors: Victor Besnier and David Hurych and Andrei Bursuc and Eduardo Valle
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: In infrared small target detection, noise from different sensors can
  cause significant interference to performance. We propose a new dataset and a
  wavelet-guided Invariance learning framework(Ivan-ISTD) to emphasize this
  issue
\\
  In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

Title: Vectorized Video Representation with Easy Editing via Hierarchical
  Spatio-Temporally Consistent Proxy Embedding
Authors: Ye Chen, Liming Tan, Yupeng Zhu, Yuanbin Wang, Bingbing Ni
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

Title: Multiplicative Loss for Enhancing Semantic Segmentation in Medical and
  Cellular Images
Authors: Yuto Yokoi and Kazuhiro Hotta
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by ICCV2025 Workshop "Third Workshop on Computer Vision for
  Automated Medical Diagnosis"
\\
  We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Title: Local Background Features Matter in Out-of-Distribution Detection
Authors: Jinlun Ye, Zhuohao Sun, Yiqiao Qiu, Qiu Li, Zhijun Tan, Ruixuan Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

  With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Title: PAGS: Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Driving Scenes
Authors: Ying A, Wenzhang Sun, Chang Zeng, Chunfeng Wang, Hao Li, Jianxun Cui
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

Title: Dual Learning with Dynamic Knowledge Distillation and Soft Alignment for
  Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
Authors: Jianfeng Dong, Lei Huang, Daizong Liu, Xianke Chen, Xun Yang,
  Changting Lin, Xun Wang, Meng Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

Title: Vision Language Models Map Logos to Text via Semantic Entanglement in
  the Visual Projector

Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
\\
  Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

  This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

  Temporal Alignment for 3D Semantic Scene Completion
Authors: Jinzhou Lin, Jie Zhou, Wenhao Xu, Rongtao Xu, Changwei Wang, Shunpeng
  Chen, Kexue Fu, Yihua Shao, Li Guo, Shibiao Xu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Title: Deep Attention-guided Adaptive Subsampling
Authors: Sharath M Shankaranarayana, Soumava Kumar Roy, Prasad Sudhakar,
  Chandan Aladahalli
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

  Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

  Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

  Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

Title: Low-Field Magnetic Resonance Image Quality Enhancement using a
  Conditional Flow Matching Model
Authors: Huu Tien Nguyen, Ahmed Karam Eldaly
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

Comments: NeurIPS-2025 Accepted Paper
\\
  Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

  We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a

applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art

  Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four

Title: BSGS: Bi-stage 3D Gaussian Splatting for Camera Motion Deblurring
Authors: An Zhao, Piaopiao Yu, Zhe Zhu, Mingqiang Wei
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

Authors: Jiayi Kong, Chen Zong, Junkai Deng, Xuhui Chen, Fei Hou, Shiqing Xin,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

Title: Unconditional Human Motion and Shape Generation via Balanced Score-Based
  Diffusion
Authors: David Bj\"orkstrand, Tiesheng Wang, Lars Bretzner, Josephine Sullivan
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space

Title: CoIRL-AD: Collaborative-Competitive Imitation-Reinforcement Learning in
  Latent World Models for Autonomous Driving

  End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

Title: MMOT: The First Challenging Benchmark for Drone-based Multispectral
  Multi-Object Tracking
Authors: Tianhao Li, Tingfa Xu, Ying Wang, Haolin Qin, Xu Lin, Jianan Li
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

Title: Learning Human Motion with Temporally Conditional Mamba

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

Title: LayerSync: Self-aligning Intermediate Layers
Authors: Yasaman Haghighi, Bastien van Delft, Mariam Hassan, Alexandre Alahi
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

Title: Advancing End-to-End Pixel Space Generative Modeling via Self-supervised
  Pre-training
Authors: Jiachen Lei, Keli Liu, Julius Berner, Haiming Yu, Hongkai Zheng,
  Jiahong Wu, Xiangxiang Chu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

Title: Reasoning in the Dark: Interleaved Vision-Text Reasoning in Latent Space
Authors: Chao Chen, Zhixin Ma, Yongqi Li, Yupeng Hu, Yinwei Wei, Wenjie Li,
  Liqiang Nie
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

  Mask Generation
Authors: Runting Li, Shijie Lian, Hua Li, Yutong Li, Wenhui Wu, Sam Kwong
Categories: cs.CV

  Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and

Title: Zero-Shot CFC: Fast Real-World Image Denoising based on Cross-Frequency
  Consistency
Authors: Yanlin Jiang, Yuchen Liu, Mingren Liu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: The British Machine Vision Conference
\\
  Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Title: On the Use of Hierarchical Vision Foundation Models for Low-Cost Human
  Mesh Recovery and Pose Estimation
Authors: Shuhei Tarashima, Yushan Wang, Norio Tagawa
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at ICCVW 2025
\\
  In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

Title: TerraCodec: Compressing Earth Observations
Authors: Julen Costa-Watanabe, Isabelle Wittmann, Benedikt Blumenstiel, Konrad

\\
  Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

  Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

  Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

Comments: Accepted to the Symposium on Model Accountability, Sustainability and
  Healthcare (SMASH) 2025
\\
  Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

\\
  Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

Title: SPORTS: Simultaneous Panoptic Odometry, Rendering, Tracking and
  Segmentation for Urban Scenes Understanding
Authors: Zhiliu Yang, Jinyu Dai, Jianyuan Zhang, Zhu Yang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia
\\
  The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

Title: E-MoFlow: Learning Egomotion and Optical Flow from Event Data via
  Implicit Regularization
Authors: Wenpu Li, Bangyan Liao, Yi Zhou, Qi Xu, Pian Wan, Peidong Liu

Comments: The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing
  Systems(NeurIPS 2025)
\\
  The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

  Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

  We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

\\
  This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

Title: Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D
  Reconstruction
Authors: Fengzhi Guo and Chih-Chuan Hsu and Sihao Ding and Cheng Zhang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.GR
Comments: Project page: https://tamu-visual-ai.github.io/usplat4d/
\\
  Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

Authors: Stefan Andreas Baumann, Nick Stracke, Timy Phan, Bj\"orn Ommer
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Project page and code:
  https://compvis.github.io/flow-poke-transformer
\\
  Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

  Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

Comments: 18 pages, 12 figures
\\
  Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

  This paper reviews the AIM 2025 Efficient Real-World Deblurring using Single
Images Challenge, which aims to advance in efficient real-blur restoration. The
challenge is based on a new test set based on the well known RSBlur dataset.
Pairs of blur and degraded images in this dataset are captured using a
double-camera system. Participant were tasked with developing solutions to
effectively deblur these type of images while fulfilling strict efficiency
constraints: fewer than 5 million model parameters and a computational budget
under 200 GMACs. A total of 71 participants registered, with 4 teams finally
submitting valid solutions. The top-performing approach achieved a PSNR of
31.1298 dB, showcasing the potential of efficient methods in this domain. This
paper provides a comprehensive overview of the challenge, compares the proposed
solutions, and serves as a valuable reference for researchers in efficient
real-world image deblurring.

\\
  Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

Title: ViCO: A Training Strategy towards Semantic Aware Dynamic High-Resolution
Authors: Long Cui, Weiyun Wang, Jie Shao, Zichen Wen, Gen Luo, Linfeng Zhang,
  Yanting Zhang, Yu Qiao, Wenhai Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

  We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

  Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

  Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

\\
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

  Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) in production faces significant
challenges from highly variable request patterns and severe resource
fragmentation in serverless clusters. Current systems rely on static pipeline
configurations that struggle to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading
to substantial inefficiencies. We present FlexPipe, a novel system that
dynamically reconfigures pipeline architectures during runtime to address these
fundamental limitations. FlexPipe decomposes models into fine-grained stages
and intelligently adjusts pipeline granularity based on real-time request
pattern analysis, implementing three key innovations: fine-grained model
partitioning with preserved computational graph constraints, inflight pipeline
refactoring with consistent cache transitions, and topology-aware resource
allocation that navigates GPU fragmentation. Comprehensive evaluation on an
82-GPU cluster demonstrates that FlexPipe achieves up to 8.5x better resource
efficiency while maintaining 38.3% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art
systems, reducing GPU reservation requirements from 75% to 30% of peak
capacity.

lack of available guidance on how to actually set up and analyze such
cross-platform studies. In this paper, we contend that the natural base unit of
computing for such studies is a single compute node on each platform and offer
guidance in setting up, running, and analyzing node-to-node scaling studies. We
propose templates for presenting scaling results of these studies and provide
several case studies highlighting the benefits of this approach.

Title: GPU-Accelerated Algorithms for Process Mapping
Authors: Petr Samoldekin, Christian Schulz, Henning Woydt
Categories: cs.DC
MSC-class: 8W10
\\
  Process mapping asks to assign vertices of a task graph to processing
elements of a supercomputer such that the computational workload is balanced
while the communication cost is minimized. Motivated by the recent success of
GPU-based graph partitioners, we propose two GPU-accelerated algorithms for
this optimization problem. The first algorithm employs hierarchical
multisection, which partitions the task graph alongside the hierarchy of the
supercomputer. The method utilizes GPU-based graph partitioners to accelerate
the mapping process. The second algorithm integrates process mapping directly
into the modern multilevel graph partitioning pipeline. Vital phases like
coarsening and refinement are accelerated by exploiting the parallelism of
GPUs. In our experiments, both methods achieve speedups exceeding 300 when
compared to state-of-the-art CPU-based algorithms. The first algorithm has, on
average, about 10 percent greater communication costs and thus remains
competitive to CPU algorithms. The second approach is much faster, with a
geometric mean speedup of 77.6 and peak speedup of 598 at the cost of lower
solution quality. To our knowledge, these are the first GPU-based algorithms
for process mapping.

Title: Metronome: Efficient Scheduling for Periodic Traffic Jobs with Network
  and Priority Awareness

\\
  With the rapid growth in computing power demand, cloud native networks have
emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of efficient resource
coordination, particularly in coping with the dynamic fluctuations of network
bandwidth in clusters. We propose Metronome, a network-aware and priority-aware
scheduling mechanism for cloud native networks. This mechanism is designed to
support jobs that exhibit periodic traffic patterns and dynamic bandwidth
demands, particularly in the context of distributed training. Specifically,
Metronome employs a time-division multiplexing approach that leverages job
traffic characteristics to construct an elastic network resource allocation
model, enabling efficient bandwidth sharing across multiple jobs. In addition,
it incorporates a multi-objective optimization strategy, jointly considering
latency and job priorities to achieve globally optimal as well as dynamic
resource allocation. Finally, Metronome adapts to the dynamic environment by
monitoring the cluster and performing reconfiguration operations. Extensive
experiments with 13 common machine learning models demonstrate that Metronome
can enhance cluster resource utilization while guaranteeing service
performance. Compared with the existing Kubernetes scheduling mechanisms across
multiple scenarios, Metronome reduces job completion time by up to 19.50% while
improving average bandwidth utilization by up to 23.20%.

Title: A Non-Intrusive Framework for Deferred Integration of Cloud Patterns in
  Energy-Efficient Data-Sharing Pipelines
Authors: Sepideh Masoudi, Mark Edward Michael Daly, Jannis Kiesel, and Stefan
  Tai
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  As data mesh architectures gain traction in federated environments,
organizations are increasingly building consumer-specific data-sharing
pipelines using modular, cloud-native transformation services. Prior work has
shown that structuring these pipelines with reusable transformation stages
enhances both scalability and energy efficiency. However, integrating
traditional cloud design patterns into such pipelines poses a challenge:
predefining and embedding patterns can compromise modularity, reduce
reusability, and conflict with the pipelines dynamic, consumer-driven nature.
To address this, we introduce a Kubernetes-based tool that enables the deferred
and non-intrusive application of selected cloud design patterns without
requiring changes to service source code. The tool supports automated pattern
injection and collects energy consumption metrics, allowing developers to make
energy-aware decisions while preserving the flexible, composable structure of
reusable data-sharing pipelines.

Title: TALP-Pages: An easy-to-integrate continuous performance monitoring
  framework
Authors: Valentin Seitz, Jordy Trilaksono, Marta Garcia-Gasulla
Categories: cs.DC cs.PF
\\
  Ensuring good performance is a key aspect in the development of codes that
target HPC machines. As these codes are under active development, the necessity
to detect performance degradation early in the development process becomes
apparent. In addition, having meaningful insight into application scaling
behavior tightly coupled to the development workflow is helpful. In this paper,
we introduce TALP-Pages, an easy-to-integrate framework that enables developers
to get fast and in-repository feedback about their code performance using
established fundamental performance and scaling factors. The framework relies
on TALP, which enables the on-the-fly collection of these metrics. Based on a
folder structure suited for CI which contains the files generated by TALP,
TALP-Pages generates an HTML report with visualizations of the performance
factor regression as well as scaling-efficiency tables. We compare TALP-Pages
to tracing-based tools in terms of overhead and post-processing requirements
and find that TALP-Pages can produce the scaling-efficiency tables faster and
under tighter resource constraints. To showcase the ease of use and
effectiveness of this approach, we extend the current CI setup of GENE-X with
only minimal changes required and showcase the ability to detect and explain a
performance improvement.

cluster computational load balancing acceleration architecture. The ESnet-JLab
FPGA Accelerated Transport (EJFAT) architecture focuses on FPGA acceleration to
address compression, fragmentation, UDP packet destination redirection (Network

  EJFAT seamlessly integrates edge and cluster computing to support direct
processing of streamed experimental data. This will directly benefit the JLab
science program as well as data centers of the future that require high
throughput and low latency for both time-critical data acquisition systems and
data center workflows.
  The EJFAT project will be presented along with how it is synergistic with
other DOE activities such as an Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI), and
recent results using data sources at JLab, an EJFAT LB at ESnet, and

Title: A GPU-resident Memory-Aware Algorithm for Accelerating Bidiagonalization
  of Banded Matrices
Authors: Evelyne Ringoot, Rabab Alomairy, Alan Edelman
Categories: cs.DC cs.MS
Comments: 13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables
\\
  The reduction of a banded matrix to a bidiagonal form is a crucial step in
the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a cornerstone of scientific computing
and AI. Despite being a highly parallel algorithm, it was previously believed
to be unsuitable for GPU computation because it is memory bandwidth-bound.
Recent developments in GPU hardware, including larger L1 memory per Streaming
Multiprocessor/Compute Unit, have changed that. We present the first GPU
algorithm for reducing a banded matrix to bidiagonal form as part of the
NextLA.jl open-source software package. Our algorithm is based on previous
CPU-based multicore parallel cache-efficient bulge chasing algorithms and
adapted to optimize for GPU throughput. We leverage Julia Language's Array
abstractions and KernelAbstractions to implement a single hardware- and data
precision-agnostic function on NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Apple Metal GPUs for
half, single, and double precision, and examine performance optimization across
hardware architectures and data precision. We also develop a hardware-aware
performance model and identify key hyperparameters, such as inner tilewidth and
block concurrency, that govern optimal GPU execution for bandwidth-bound
workloads. We demonstrate highly parallel bandwidth-bound algorithm on the GPU
can outperform CPU-based implementations: the GPU algorithm outperforms
multithreaded CPU High-Performance libraries PLASMA and SLATE as of matrix size
1024 x 1024 and by a factor over 100 for matrices of 32k x 32k. In addition,
the performance of the algorithm increases linearly with matrix bandwidth size,
making faster reduction of larger matrix bandwidths now also possible. With
this work, we break memory bandwidth barriers, as well as matrix bandwidth
barriers, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster algorithms for the reduction
of banded matrices to bidiagonal form on the GPU.

\\
  In cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it is a common
practice to tune hyperparameters in ideal simulated environments to maximize
cooperative performance. However, policies tuned for cooperation often fail to
maintain robustness and resilience under real-world uncertainties. Building
trustworthy MARL systems requires a deep understanding of robustness, which
ensures stability under uncertainties, and resilience, the ability to recover
from disruptions--a concept extensively studied in control systems but largely
overlooked in MARL. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study
comprising over 82,620 experiments to evaluate cooperation, robustness, and
resilience in MARL across 4 real-world environments, 13 uncertainty types, and
15 hyperparameters. Our key findings are: (1) Under mild uncertainty,
optimizing cooperation improves robustness and resilience, but this link
weakens as perturbations intensify. Robustness and resilience also varies by
algorithm and uncertainty type. (2) Robustness and resilience do not generalize
across uncertainty modalities or agent scopes: policies robust to action noise
for all agents may fail under observation noise on a single agent. (3)
Hyperparameter tuning is critical for trustworthy MARL: surprisingly, standard
practices like parameter sharing, GAE, and PopArt can hurt robustness, while
early stopping, high critic learning rates, and Leaky ReLU consistently help.
By optimizing hyperparameters only, we observe substantial improvement in
cooperation, robustness and resilience across all MARL backbones, with the
phenomenon also generalizing to robust MARL methods across these backbones.

Title: Heterogeneous RBCs via deep multi-agent reinforcement learning
Authors: Federico Gabriele, Aldo Glielmo, Marco Taboga
Categories: cs.MA cs.LG econ.TH
Comments: 13 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Current macroeconomic models with agent heterogeneity can be broadly divided
into two main groups. Heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium (GE) models, such
as those based on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) or Krusell-Smith
(KS) approaches, rely on GE and 'rational expectations', somewhat unrealistic
assumptions that make the models very computationally cumbersome, which in turn
limits the amount of heterogeneity that can be modelled. In contrast,
agent-based models (ABMs) can flexibly encompass a large number of arbitrarily
heterogeneous agents, but typically require the specification of explicit
behavioural rules, which can lead to a lengthy trial-and-error
model-development process. To address these limitations, we introduce MARL-BC,
a framework that integrates deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with
Real Business Cycle (RBC) models. We demonstrate that MARL-BC can: (1) recover
textbook RBC results when using a single agent; (2) recover the results of the
mean-field KS model using a large number of identical agents; and (3)
effectively simulate rich heterogeneity among agents, a hard task for
traditional GE approaches. Our framework can be thought of as an ABM if used
with a variety of heterogeneous interacting agents, and can reproduce GE
results in limit cases. As such, it is a step towards a synthesis of these
often opposed modelling paradigms.

Title: Characterizing Agent-Based Model Dynamics via $\epsilon$-Machines and

MSC-class: 68U20, 94A17, 37N99
ACM-class: I.6.3; I.2.11; G.3; H.1.1
\\
  We propose a two-level information-theoretic framework for characterizing the
informational organization of Agent-Based Model (ABM) dynamics within the
broader paradigm of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). At the macro level, a
pooled $\epsilon$-machine is reconstructed as a reference model that summarizes
the system-wide informational regime. At the micro level, $\epsilon$-machines
are reconstructed for each caregiver-elder dyad and variable, and are
complemented with algorithm-agnostic Kolmogorov-style measures, including
normalized LZ78 complexity and bits per symbol from lossless compression. The
resulting feature set $\{h_{\mu}, C_{\mu}, E, \mathrm{LZ78}, \mathrm{bps}\}$
enables distributional analysis, stratified comparisons, and unsupervised
clustering across agents and scenarios. This dual-scale design preserves agent
heterogeneity while providing an interpretable macro-level baseline, aligning
ABM practice with CAS principles of emergence, feedback, and adaptation. A case
study on caregiver-elder interactions illustrates the framework's
implementation; the results and discussion will be completed following final
simulation runs.

  MOVEMETHOD is a hallmark refactoring. Despite a plethora of research tools
that recommend which methods to move and where, these recommendations do not
align with how expert developers perform MOVEMETHOD. Given the extensive
training of Large Language Models and their reliance upon naturalness of code,
they should expertly recommend which methods are misplaced in a given class and
which classes are better hosts. Our formative study of 2016 LLM recommendations
revealed that LLMs give expert suggestions, yet they are unreliable: up to 80%
of the suggestions are hallucinations. We introduce the first LLM fully powered
assistant for MOVEMETHOD refactoring that automates its whole end-to-end
lifecycle, from recommendation to execution. We designed novel solutions that
automatically filter LLM hallucinations using static analysis from IDEs and a
novel workflow that requires LLMs to be self-consistent, critique, and rank
refactoring suggestions. As MOVEMETHOD refactoring requires global,
projectlevel reasoning, we solved the limited context size of LLMs by employing
refactoring-aware retrieval augment generation (RAG). Our approach, MM-assist,
synergistically combines the strengths of the LLM, IDE, static analysis, and
semantic relevance. In our thorough, multi-methodology empirical evaluation, we
compare MM-assist with the previous state-of-the-art approaches. MM-assist
significantly outperforms them: (i) on a benchmark widely used by other
researchers, our Recall@1 and Recall@3 show a 1.7x improvement; (ii) on a
corpus of 210 recent refactorings from Open-source software, our Recall rates
improve by at least 2.4x. Lastly, we conducted a user study with 30 experienced
participants who used MM-assist to refactor their own code for one week. They
rated 82.8% of MM-assist recommendations positively. This shows that MM-assist
is both effective and useful.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  The {\em stop gradient} and {\em exponential moving average} iterative
procedures are commonly used in non-contrastive approaches to self-supervised
learning to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in
downstream applications in practice. This presentation investigates these
procedures from the dual viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We
show that, in general, although they {\em do not} optimize the original
objective, or {\em any} other smooth function, they {\em do} avoid collapse
Following~\citet{Tian21}, but without any of the extra assumptions used in
their proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the
linear case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a
stop gradient or exponential moving average {\em always} leads to collapse.
Conversely, we characterize explicitly the equilibria of the dynamical systems
associated with these two procedures in this linear setting as algebraic
varieties in their parameter space, and show that they are, in general, {\em
asymptotically stable}. Our theoretical findings are illustrated by empirical
experiments with real and synthetic data.

  Due to the advantages of hypergraphs in modeling high-order relationships in
complex systems, they have been applied to higher-order clustering, hypergraph
neural networks and computer vision. These applications rely heavily on access
to high-quality, large-scale real-world hypergraph data. Yet, compared to
traditional pairwise graphs, real hypergraph datasets remain scarce in both
scale and diversity. This shortage significantly limits the development and
evaluation of advanced hypergraph learning algorithms. Therefore, how to
quickly generate large-scale hypergraphs that conform to the characteristics of
real networks is a crucial task that has not received sufficient attention.
Motivated by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly
their capabilities in semantic reasoning, structured generation, and simulating
human behavior, we investigate whether LLMs can facilitate hypergraph
generation from a fundamentally new perspective. We introduce HyperLLM, a novel
LLM-driven hypergraph generator that simulates the formation and evolution of
hypergraphs through a multi-agent collaboration. The framework integrates
prompts and structural feedback mechanisms to ensure that the generated
hypergraphs reflect key real-world patterns. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets demonstrate that HyperLLM achieves superior fidelity to
structural and temporal hypergraph patterns, while requiring minimal
statistical priors. Our findings suggest that LLM-based frameworks offer a
promising new direction for hypergraph modeling.

Comments: Accepted by NCMMSC2025
\\
  Speaking Style Recognition (SSR) identifies a speaker's speaking style
characteristics from speech. Existing style recognition approaches primarily
rely on linguistic information, with limited integration of acoustic
information, which restricts recognition accuracy improvements. The fusion of
acoustic and linguistic modalities offers significant potential to enhance
recognition performance. In this paper, we propose a novel serial-parallel
dual-path architecture for SSR that leverages acoustic-linguistic bimodal
information. The serial path follows the ASR+STYLE serial paradigm, reflecting
a sequential temporal dependency, while the parallel path integrates our
designed Acoustic-Linguistic Similarity Module (ALSM) to facilitate cross-modal
interaction with temporal simultaneity. Compared to the existing SSR baseline
-- the OSUM model, our approach reduces parameter size by 88.4% and achieves a
30.3% improvement in SSR accuracy for eight styles on the test set.

Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  This research focuses on using large language models (LLMs) to simulate
social experiments, exploring their ability to emulate human personality in
virtual persona role-playing. The research develops an end-to-end evaluation
framework, including individual-level analysis of stability and
identifiability, as well as population-level analysis called progressive
personality curves to examine the veracity and consistency of LLMs in
simulating human personality. Methodologically, this research proposes
important modifications to traditional psychometric approaches (CFA and
construct validity) which are unable to capture improvement trends in LLMs at
their current low-level simulation, potentially leading to remature rejection
or methodological misalignment. The main contributions of this research are:
proposing a systematic framework for LLM virtual personality evaluation;
empirically demonstrating the critical role of persona detail in personality
simulation quality; and identifying marginal utility effects of persona
profiles, especially a Scaling Law in LLM personality simulation, offering
operational evaluation metrics and a theoretical foundation for applying large
language models in social science experiments.

\\
  We introduce SeeingSounds, a lightweight and modular framework for
audio-to-image generation that leverages the interplay between audio, language,
and vision-without requiring any paired audio-visual data or training on visual
generative models. Rather than treating audio as a substitute for text or
relying solely on audio-to-text mappings, our method performs dual alignment:
audio is projected into a semantic language space via a frozen language
encoder, and, contextually grounded into the visual domain using a
vision-language model. This approach, inspired by cognitive neuroscience,
reflects the natural cross-modal associations observed in human perception. The
model operates on frozen diffusion backbones and trains only lightweight
adapters, enabling efficient and scalable learning. Moreover, it supports
fine-grained and interpretable control through procedural text prompt
generation, where audio transformations (e.g., volume or pitch shifts)
translate into descriptive prompts (e.g., "a distant thunder") that guide
visual outputs. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks confirm that
SeeingSounds outperforms existing methods in both zero-shot and supervised
settings, establishing a new state of the art in controllable audio-to-visual
generation.

Title: Celebrity Profiling on Short Urdu Text using Twitter Followers' Feed
Authors: Muhammad Hamza, Rizwan Jafar
Categories: cs.SI cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Social media has become an essential part of the digital age, serving as a
platform for communication, interaction, and information sharing. Celebrities
are among the most active users and often reveal aspects of their personal and
professional lives through online posts. Platforms such as Twitter provide an
opportunity to analyze language and behavior for understanding demographic and
social patterns. Since followers frequently share linguistic traits and
interests with the celebrities they follow, textual data from followers can be
used to predict celebrity demographics. However, most existing research in this
field has focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving Urdu
largely unexplored.
  This study applies modern machine learning and deep learning techniques to
the problem of celebrity profiling in Urdu. A dataset of short Urdu tweets from
followers of subcontinent celebrities was collected and preprocessed. Multiple
algorithms were trained and compared, including Logistic Regression, Support
Vector Machines, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long
Short-Term Memory networks. The models were evaluated using accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score, and cumulative rank (cRank). The best performance
was achieved for gender prediction with a cRank of 0.65 and an accuracy of
0.65, followed by moderate results for age, profession, and fame prediction.
These results demonstrate that follower-based linguistic features can be
effectively leveraged using machine learning and neural approaches for
demographic prediction in Urdu, a low-resource language.

  Proteins are essential biological macromolecules that execute life functions.
Local motifs within protein structures, such as active sites, are the most
critical components for linking structure to function and are key to
understanding protein evolution and enabling protein engineering. Existing
computational methods struggle to identify and compare these local structures,
which leaves a significant gap in understanding protein structures and
harnessing their functions. This study presents PLASMA, the first deep learning
framework for efficient and interpretable residue-level protein substructure
alignment. We reformulate the problem as a regularized optimal transport task
and leverage differentiable Sinkhorn iterations. For a pair of input protein
structures, PLASMA outputs a clear alignment matrix with an interpretable
overall similarity score. Through extensive quantitative evaluations and three
biological case studies, we demonstrate that PLASMA achieves accurate,
lightweight, and interpretable residue-level alignment. Additionally, we
introduce PLASMA-PF, a training-free variant that provides a practical
alternative when training data are unavailable. Our method addresses a critical
gap in protein structure analysis tools and offers new opportunities for
functional annotation, evolutionary studies, and structure-based drug design.

  Radiation therapy treatment planning is an iterative, expertise-dependent
process, and the growing burden of cancer cases has made reliance on manual
planning increasingly unsustainable, underscoring the need for automation. In
this study, we propose a workflow that leverages a large language model
(LLM)-based agent to navigate inverse treatment planning for
intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The LLM agent was implemented to
directly interact with a clinical treatment planning system (TPS) to
iteratively extract intermediate plan states and propose new constraint values
to guide inverse optimization. The agent's decision-making process is informed
by current observations and previous optimization attempts and evaluations,
allowing for dynamic strategy refinement. The planning process was performed in
a zero-shot inference setting, where the LLM operated without prior exposure to
manually generated treatment plans and was utilized without any fine-tuning or
task-specific training. The LLM-generated plans were evaluated on twenty
head-and-neck cancer cases against clinical manual plans, with key dosimetric
endpoints analyzed and reported. The LLM-generated plans achieved comparable
organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing relative to clinical plans while demonstrating
improved hot spot control (Dmax: 106.5% vs. 108.8%) and superior conformity
(conformity index: 1.18 vs. 1.39 for boost PTV; 1.82 vs. 1.88 for primary PTV).
This study demonstrates the feasibility of a zero-shot, LLM-driven workflow for
automated IMRT treatment planning in a commercial TPS. The proposed approach
provides a generalizable and clinically applicable solution that could reduce
planning variability and support broader adoption of AI-based planning
strategies.

Title: Artificial Intelligence for Optimal Learning: A Comparative Approach
  towards AI-Enhanced Learning Environments
Authors: Ananth Hariharan
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  In the rapidly evolving educational landscape, the integration of technology
has shifted from an enhancement to a cornerstone of educational strategy
worldwide. This transition is propelled by advancements in digital technology,
especially the emergence of artificial intelligence as a crucial tool in
learning environments. This research project critically evaluates the impact of
three distinct educational settings: traditional educational methods without
technological integration, those enhanced by non-AI technology, and those
utilising AI-driven technologies. This comparison aims to assess how each
environment influences educational outcomes, engagement, pedagogical methods,
and equity in access to learning resources, and how each contributes uniquely
to the learning experience. The ultimate goal of this research is to synthesise
the strengths of each model to create a more holistic educational approach. By
integrating the personal interaction and tested pedagogical techniques of
traditional classrooms, the enhanced accessibility and collaborative tools
offered by non-AI technology, and the personalised, adaptive learning
strategies enabled by AI-driven technologies, education systems can develop
richer, more effective learning environments. This hybrid approach aims to
leverage the best elements of each setting, thereby enhancing educational
outcomes, engagement, and inclusiveness, while also addressing the distinct
challenges and limitations inherent in each model. The intention is to create
an educational framework deeply attentive to the diverse needs of students,
ensuring equitable access to high-quality education for all.

Title: The Adoption Paradox: A Comparative Analysis of Veterinary AI Adoption
  in China and the North America

  This study compares the perception, adoption, and application of artificial
intelligence (AI) among veterinary professionals in China and North America
(NA), testing the hypothesis that adoption patterns are shaped by regional
market and demographic factors. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was
conducted with 455 veterinary professionals in China between May and July 2025.
The results were compared with published data from a 2024 survey of 3,968
veterinary professionals in the United States and Canada. The Chinese cohort,
primarily composed of clinicians (81.5%), showed a high AI adoption rate
(71.0%) despite low familiarity (55.4%). Their AI use was focused on clinical
tasks, such as disease diagnosis (50.1%) and prescription calculation (44.8%).
In contrast, the NA cohort reported high familiarity (83.8%) but a lower
adoption rate (39.2%). Their priorities were administrative, including imaging
analysis (39.0%) and record-keeping (39.0%). Concerns about AI reliability and
accuracy were the top barrier in both groups. Our findings reveal an "adoption
paradox" where the Chinese market demonstrates a practitioner-driven, bottom-up
adoption model focused on augmenting clinical efficacy, while the NA market
shows a more cautious, structured, top-down integration aimed at improving
administrative efficiency. This suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to
AI development and integration is insufficient, and tailored, region-specific
strategies are necessary to responsibly incorporate AI into global veterinary
practice.

  Synergistic Knowledge-Data Driven Framework
Authors: Hongyu Lin, Haolin Pan, Haoran Luo, Yuchen Li, Kaichun Yao, Libo
  Zhang, Mingjie Xing, Yanjun Wu
Categories: cs.PL cs.AI
\\
  Compiler optimization is crucial for enhancing program performance by
transforming the sequence of optimization passes while maintaining correctness.
Despite the promising potential of large language models (LLMs)-based agent for
software optimization, automating compiler optimization remains challenging due
to: (1) semantic misalignment between abstract program representations and
concrete optimization passes, (2) inefficient interaction mechanisms between
agents and compiler environments, and (3) reward sparsity from the extensive
decision-making process within large optimization spaces. This paper introduces
\textbf{AwareCompiler}, an agentic framework for compiler optimization that
addresses these challenges through three key innovations: structured knowledge
integration and dataset construction, knowledge-driven adaptive pass
generation, and data-driven hybrid training pipeline. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that AwareCompiler significantly outperforms
existing baselines in both performance and efficiency, highlighting the
effectiveness of our synergistic knowledge-data-driven approach. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/LHY-24/AwareCompiler.

\\
  Audio-Visual Embodied Navigation aims to enable agents to autonomously
navigate to sound sources in unknown 3D environments using auditory cues. While
current AVN methods excel on in-distribution sound sources, they exhibit poor
cross-source generalization: navigation success rates plummet and search paths
become excessively long when agents encounter unheard sounds or unseen
environments. This limitation stems from the lack of explicit alignment
mechanisms between auditory signals and corresponding visual regions. Policies
tend to memorize spurious \enquote{acoustic fingerprint-scenario} correlations
during training, leading to blind exploration when exposed to novel sound
sources. To address this, we propose the AGVP framework, which transforms sound
from policy-memorable acoustic fingerprint cues into spatial guidance. The
framework first extracts global auditory context via audio self-attention, then
uses this context as queries to guide visual feature attention, highlighting
sound-source-related regions at the feature level. Subsequent temporal modeling
and policy optimization are then performed. This design, centered on
interpretable cross-modal alignment and region reweighting, reduces dependency
on specific acoustic fingerprints. Experimental results demonstrate that AGVP
improves both navigation efficiency and robustness while achieving superior
cross-scenario generalization on previously unheard sounds.

Title: GAR: Generative Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Formal Theorem
  Proving
Authors: Ruida Wang, Jiarui Yao, Rui Pan, Shizhe Diao, Tong Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

Title: BlackIce: A Containerized Red Teaming Toolkit for AI Security Testing
Authors: Caelin Kaplan, Alexander Warnecke, and Neil Archibald
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  AI models are being increasingly integrated into real-world systems, raising
significant concerns about their safety and security. Consequently, AI red
teaming has become essential for organizations to proactively identify and
address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by adversaries. While
numerous AI red teaming tools currently exist, practitioners face challenges in
selecting the most appropriate tools from a rapidly expanding landscape, as
well as managing complex and frequently conflicting software dependencies
across isolated projects. Given these challenges and the relatively small
number of organizations with dedicated AI red teams, there is a strong need to
lower barriers to entry and establish a standardized environment that
simplifies the setup and execution of comprehensive AI model assessments.
  Inspired by Kali Linux's role in traditional penetration testing, we
introduce BlackIce, an open-source containerized toolkit designed for red
teaming Large Language Models (LLMs) and classical machine learning (ML)
models. BlackIce provides a reproducible, version-pinned Docker image that
bundles 14 carefully selected open-source tools for Responsible AI and Security
testing, all accessible via a unified command-line interface. With this setup,
initiating red team assessments is as straightforward as launching a container,
either locally or using a cloud platform. Additionally, the image's modular
architecture facilitates community-driven extensions, allowing users to easily
adapt or expand the toolkit as new threats emerge. In this paper, we describe
the architecture of the container image, the process used for selecting tools,
and the types of evaluations they support.

Title: Combining Euclidean and Hyperbolic Representations for Node-level
  Anomaly Detection
Authors: Simone Mungari, Ettore Ritacco, Pietro Sabatino
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

\\
  The security of Large Language Model (LLM) applications is fundamentally
challenged by "form-first" attacks like prompt injection and jailbreaking,
where malicious instructions are embedded within user inputs. Conventional
defenses, which rely on post hoc output filtering, are often brittle and fail
to address the root cause: the model's inability to distinguish trusted
instructions from untrusted data. This paper proposes Countermind, a
multi-layered security architecture intended to shift defenses from a reactive,
post hoc posture to a proactive, pre-inference, and intra-inference enforcement
model. The architecture proposes a fortified perimeter designed to structurally
validate and transform all inputs, and an internal governance mechanism
intended to constrain the model's semantic processing pathways before an output
is generated. The primary contributions of this work are conceptual designs
for: (1) A Semantic Boundary Logic (SBL) with a mandatory, time-coupled Text
Crypter intended to reduce the plaintext prompt injection attack surface,
provided all ingestion paths are enforced. (2) A Parameter-Space Restriction
(PSR) mechanism, leveraging principles from representation engineering, to
dynamically control the LLM's access to internal semantic clusters, with the
goal of mitigating semantic drift and dangerous emergent behaviors. (3) A
Secure, Self-Regulating Core that uses an OODA loop and a learning security
module to adapt its defenses based on an immutable audit log. (4) A Multimodal
Input Sandbox and Context-Defense mechanisms to address threats from
non-textual data and long-term semantic poisoning. This paper outlines an
evaluation plan designed to quantify the proposed architecture's effectiveness
in reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for form-first attacks and to measure
its potential latency overhead.

Title: Integrating Sequential and Relational Modeling for User Events: Datasets
  and Prediction Tasks
Authors: Rizal Fathony, Igor Melnyk, Owen Reinert, Nam H. Nguyen, Daniele Rosa,
  C. Bayan Bruss
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

Title: Indoor Localization using Compact, Telemetry-Agnostic, Transfer-Learning
  Enabled Decoder-Only Transformer

\\
  Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

Title: Sculpting Latent Spaces With MMD: Disentanglement With Programmable
  Priors
Authors: Quentin Fruytier, Akshay Malhotra, Shahab Hamidi-Rad, Aditya Sant,
  Aryan Mokhtari, Sujay Sanghavi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

Title: CTIArena: Benchmarking LLM Knowledge and Reasoning Across Heterogeneous
  Cyber Threat Intelligence
Authors: Yutong Cheng, Yang Liu, Changze Li, Dawn Song, Peng Gao
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
Comments: Under peer-review
\\
  Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is central to modern cybersecurity, providing
critical insights for detecting and mitigating evolving threats. With the
natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying them to CTI, which
calls for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate their performance. Several
early efforts have studied LLMs on some CTI tasks but remain limited: (i) they
adopt only closed-book settings, relying on parametric knowledge without
leveraging CTI knowledge bases; (ii) they cover only a narrow set of tasks,
lacking a systematic view of the CTI landscape; and (iii) they restrict
evaluation to single-source analysis, unlike realistic scenarios that require
reasoning across multiple sources. To fill these gaps, we present CTIArena, the
first benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on heterogeneous, multi-source
CTI under knowledge-augmented settings. CTIArena spans three categories,
structured, unstructured, and hybrid, further divided into nine tasks that
capture the breadth of CTI analysis in modern security operations. We evaluate
ten widely used LLMs and find that most struggle in closed-book setups but show
noticeable gains when augmented with security-specific knowledge through our
designed retrieval-augmented techniques. These findings highlight the
limitations of general-purpose LLMs and the need for domain-tailored techniques
to fully unlock their potential for CTI.

Title: Learning Dynamics of VLM Finetuning
Authors: Jusheng Zhang, Kaitong Cai, Jing Yang, Keze Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

  We quantify the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on firm
productivity through a series of large-scale randomized field experiments
involving millions of users and products at a leading cross-border online
retail platform. Over six months in 2023-2024, GenAI-based enhancements were
integrated into seven consumer-facing business workflows. We find that GenAI
adoption significantly increases sales, with treatment effects ranging from 0\%
to 16.3\%, depending on GenAI's marginal contribution relative to existing firm
practices. Because inputs and prices were held constant across experimental
arms, these gains map directly into total factor productivity improvements.
Across the four GenAI applications with positive effects, the implied annual
incremental value is approximately \$5 per consumer-an economically meaningful
impact given the retailer's scale and the early stage of GenAI adoption. The
primary mechanism operates through higher conversion rates, consistent with
GenAI reducing frictions in the marketplace and improving consumer experience.
We also document substantial heterogeneity: smaller and newer sellers, as well
as less experienced consumers, exhibit disproportionately larger gains. Our
findings provide novel, large-scale causal evidence on the productivity effects
of GenAI in online retail, highlighting both its immediate value and broader
potential.

Title: Your VAR Model is Secretly an Efficient and Explainable Generative
  Classifier
Authors: Yi-Chung Chen, David I. Inouye, Jing Gao
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

Title: MEASURE: Multi-scale Minimal Sufficient Representation Learning for
  Domain Generalization in Sleep Staging
Authors: Sangmin Jo, Jee Seok Yoon, Wootaek Jeong, Kwanseok Oh, Heung-Il Suk

\\
  Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our

Title: Enhancing Neural Code Representation with Additional Context
Authors: Huy Nguyen, Christoph Treude, Patanamon Thongtanunam
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
Comments: 34 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables
\\
  Automated program comprehension underpins many software engineering tasks,
from code summarisation to clone detection. Recent deep learning models achieve
strong results but typically rely on source code alone, overlooking contextual
information such as version history or structural relationships. This limits
their ability to capture how code evolves and operates. We conduct an empirical
study on how enriching code representations with such contextual signals
affects neural model performance on key comprehension tasks. Two downstream
tasks, code clone detection and code summarisation, are evaluated using SeSaMe
(1,679 Java methods) and CodeSearchNet (63,259 methods). Five representative
models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, PLBART, ASTNN) are fine-tuned under
code-only and context-augmented settings. Results show that context generally
improves performance: version history consistently boosts clone detection
(e.g., CodeT5 +15.92% F1) and summarisation (e.g., GraphCodeBERT +5.56%
METEOR), while call-graph effects vary by model and task. Combining multiple
contexts yields further gains (up to +21.48% macro-F1). Human evaluation on 100
Java snippets confirms that context-augmented summaries are significantly
preferred for Accuracy and Content Adequacy (p <= 0.026; |delta| up to 0.55).
These findings highlight the potential of contextual signals to enhance code
comprehension and open new directions for optimising contextual encoding in
neural SE models.

Title: Chimera: State Space Models Beyond Sequences
Authors: Aakash Lahoti, Tanya Marwah, Ratish Puduppully, Albert Gu

Comments: Published in TMLR (October 2025); 22 Pages, 6 Figures, 11 Tables
\\
  Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

Title: Budget-constrained Active Learning to Effectively De-censor Survival
  Data
Authors: Ali Parsaee, Bei Jiang, Zachary Friggstad, Russell Greiner
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

Title: Revisiting Meta-Learning with Noisy Labels: Reweighting Dynamics and
  Theoretical Guarantees
Authors: Yiming Zhang, Chester Holtz, Gal Mishne, Alex Cloninger
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

Title: DE3S: Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning for Medical Early
  Time-Series Classification
Authors: Tao Xie and Zexi Tan and Haoyi Xiao and Binbin Sun and Yiqun Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Accepted to IEEE BIBM 2025
\\
  Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

Title: MoRA: On-the-fly Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation Framework for
  LLM-based Multi-Modal Molecular Assistant
Authors: Tao Yin, Xiaohong Zhang, Jiacheng Zhang, Li Huang, Zhibin Zhang,
  Yuansong Zeng, Jin Xie and Meng Yan
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

Title: PromptLocate: Localizing Prompt Injection Attacks
Authors: Yuqi Jia, Yupei Liu, Zedian Shao, Jinyuan Jia, Neil Gong
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
Comments: To appear in IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2026
\\
  Prompt injection attacks deceive a large language model into completing an
attacker-specified task instead of its intended task by contaminating its input
data with an injected prompt, which consists of injected instruction(s) and
data. Localizing the injected prompt within contaminated data is crucial for
post-attack forensic analysis and data recovery. Despite its growing
importance, prompt injection localization remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we bridge this gap by proposing PromptLocate, the first method for
localizing injected prompts. PromptLocate comprises three steps: (1) splitting
the contaminated data into semantically coherent segments, (2) identifying
segments contaminated by injected instructions, and (3) pinpointing segments
contaminated by injected data. We show PromptLocate accurately localizes
injected prompts across eight existing and eight adaptive attacks.

  Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively
maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for
papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.

Title: Human-in-the-Loop Bandwidth Estimation for Quality of Experience
  Optimization in Real-Time Video Communication

Comments: Accepted for publication in the proceedings of the AAAI Conference on
  Artificial Intelligence 2026 (IAAI Technical Track on Deployed Highly
  Innovative Applications of AI)
\\
  The quality of experience (QoE) delivered by video conferencing systems is
significantly influenced by accurately estimating the time-varying available
bandwidth between the sender and receiver. Bandwidth estimation for real-time
communications remains an open challenge due to rapidly evolving network
architectures, increasingly complex protocol stacks, and the difficulty of
defining QoE metrics that reliably improve user experience. In this work, we
propose a deployed, human-in-the-loop, data-driven framework for bandwidth
estimation to address these challenges. Our approach begins with training
objective QoE reward models derived from subjective user evaluations to measure
audio and video quality in real-time video conferencing systems. Subsequently,
we collect roughly $1$M network traces with objective QoE rewards from
real-world Microsoft Teams calls to curate a bandwidth estimation training
dataset. We then introduce a novel distributional offline reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm to train a neural-network-based bandwidth estimator
aimed at improving QoE for users. Our real-world A/B test demonstrates that the
proposed approach reduces the subjective poor call ratio by $11.41\%$ compared
to the baseline bandwidth estimator. Furthermore, the proposed offline RL
algorithm is benchmarked on D4RL tasks to demonstrate its generalization beyond
bandwidth estimation.

Title: HiLoRA: Adaptive Hierarchical LoRA Routing for Training-Free Domain
  Generalization
Authors: Ziyi Han, Huanyu Wang, Zeyu Zhang, Xiangxiang Dai, Xutong Liu, John
  C.S. Lui
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

  Brain-Controlled Speaker Extraction
Authors: Youhao Si, Yuan Liao, Qiushi Han, Yuhang Yang, Rui Dai and Liya Huang

Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures
\\
  The rapid development of auditory attention decoding (AAD) based on
electroencephalography (EEG) signals offers the possibility EEG-driven target
speaker extraction. However, how to effectively utilize the target-speaker
common information between EEG and speech remains an unresolved problem. In
this paper, we propose a model for brain-controlled speaker extraction, which
utilizes the EEG recorded from the listener to extract the target speech. In
order to effectively extract information from EEG signals, we derive
multi-scale time--frequency features and further incorporate cortical
topological structures that are selectively engaged during the task. Moreover,
to effectively exploit the non-Euclidean structure of EEG signals and capture
their global features, the graph convolutional networks and self-attention
mechanism are used in the EEG encoder. In addition, to make full use of the
fused EEG and speech feature and preserve global context and capture speech
rhythm and prosody, we introduce MossFormer2 which combines MossFormer and
RNN-Free Recurrent as separator. Experimental results on both the public
Cocktail Party and KUL dataset in this paper show that our TFGA-Net model
significantly outper-forms the state-of-the-art method in certain objective
evaluation metrics. The source code is available at:

Title: Deep SPI: Safe Policy Improvement via World Models
Authors: Florent Delgrange, Raphael Avalos, and Willem R\"opke
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 10 pages main text, 17 pages appendix (excluding references)
\\
  Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

Title: Causal Inspired Multi Modal Recommendation
Authors: Jie Yang, Chenyang Gu, and Zixuan Liu
Categories: cs.IR cs.AI
\\
  Multimodal recommender systems enhance personalized recommendations in
e-commerce and online advertising by integrating visual, textual, and user-item
interaction data. However, existing methods often overlook two critical biases:
(i) modal confounding, where latent factors (e.g., brand style or product
category) simultaneously drive multiple modalities and influence user
preference, leading to spurious feature-preference associations; (ii)
interaction bias, where genuine user preferences are mixed with noise from
exposure effects and accidental clicks. To address these challenges, we propose
a Causal-inspired multimodal Recommendation framework. Specifically, we
introduce a dual-channel cross-modal diffusion module to identify hidden modal
confounders, utilize back-door adjustment with hierarchical matching and
vector-quantized codebooks to block confounding paths, and apply front-door
adjustment combined with causal topology reconstruction to build a deconfounded
causal subgraph. Extensive experiments on three real-world e-commerce datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines while maintaining strong interpretability.

Title: Simple Projection Variants Improve ColBERT Performance

  Kato
Categories: cs.IR cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Multi-vector dense retrieval methods like ColBERT systematically use a
single-layer linear projection to reduce the dimensionality of individual
vectors. In this study, we explore the implications of the MaxSim operator on
the gradient flows of the training of multi-vector models and show that such a
simple linear projection has inherent, if non-critical, limitations in this
setting. We then discuss the theoretical improvements that could result from
replacing this single-layer projection with well-studied alternative
feedforward linear networks (FFN), such as deeper, non-linear FFN blocks, GLU
blocks, and skip-connections, could alleviate these limitations. Through the
design and systematic evaluation of alternate projection blocks, we show that
better-designed final projections positively impact the downstream performance
of ColBERT models. We highlight that many projection variants outperform the
original linear projections, with the best-performing variants increasing
average performance on a range of retrieval benchmarks across domains by over 2
NDCG@10 points. We then conduct further exploration on the individual
parameters of these projections block in order to understand what drives this
empirical performance, highlighting the particular importance of upscaled
intermediate projections and residual connections. As part of these ablation
studies, we show that numerous suboptimal projection variants still outperform
the traditional single-layer projection across multiple benchmarks, confirming
our hypothesis. Finally, we observe that this effect is consistent across
random seeds, further confirming that replacing the linear layer of ColBERT
models is a robust, drop-in upgrade.

Title: Finite-time Convergence Analysis of Actor-Critic with Evolving Reward
Authors: Rui Hu, Yu Chen, Longbo Huang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

\\
  Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI),
particularly large language models, have introduced new possibilities for
software development practices. In our paper we investigate the emerging Vibe
Coding (VC) paradigm that emphasizes intuitive, affect-driven, and
improvisational interactions between developers and AI systems. Building upon
the discourse of End-User Development (EUD), we explore how VC diverges from
conventional programming approaches such as those supported by tools like
GitHub Copilot. Through five semi-structured interview sessions with ten
experienced software practitioners, we identify five thematic dimensions:
creativity, sustainability, the future of programming, collaboration, and
criticism. Our analysis conceptualizes VC within the metaphor of co-drifting,
contrasting it with the prevalent co-piloting perspective of AI-assisted
development. We argue that VC reconfigures the developers role, blurring
boundaries between professional and non-developers. While VC enables novel
forms of expression and rapid prototyping, it also introduces challenges
regarding reproducibility, scalability, and inclusivity. We propose that VC
represents a meaningful shift in programming culture, warranting further
investigation within human-computer interaction (HCI) and software engineering
research.

  In the last decade, video workflows in the cinema production ecosystem have
presented new use cases for video streaming technology. These new workflows,
e.g. in On-set Virtual Production, present the challenge of requiring precise

AV1 encoders that achieve a specified VMAF score. We use low-complexity
features, including bitstream characteristics, video complexity measures, and
CLIP-based semantic embeddings. Our results demonstrate that LiteVPNet achieves
mean VMAF errors below 1.2 points across a wide range of quality targets.
Notably, LiteVPNet achieves VMAF errors within 2 points for over 87% of our
test corpus, c.f. approx 61% with state-of-the-art methods. LiteVPNet's
performance across various quality regions highlights its applicability for
enhancing high-value content transport and streaming for more energy-efficient,
high-quality media experiences.

Title: Phenome-Wide Multi-Omics Integration Uncovers Distinct Archetypes of
  Human Aging
Authors: Huifa Li, Feilong Tang, Haochen Xue, Yulong Li, Xinlin Zhuang, Bin

  Aging is a highly complex and heterogeneous process that progresses at
different rates across individuals, making biological age (BA) a more accurate
indicator of physiological decline than chronological age. While previous
studies have built aging clocks using single-omics data, they often fail to
capture the full molecular complexity of human aging. In this work, we
leveraged the Human Phenotype Project, a large-scale cohort of 12,000 adults
aged 30--70 years, with extensive longitudinal profiling that includes
clinical, behavioral, environmental, and multi-omics datasets -- spanning
transcriptomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome. By employing
advanced machine learning frameworks capable of modeling nonlinear biological
dynamics, we developed and rigorously validated a multi-omics aging clock that
robustly predicts diverse health outcomes and future disease risk. Unsupervised
clustering of the integrated molecular profiles from multi-omics uncovered
distinct biological subtypes of aging, revealing striking heterogeneity in
aging trajectories and pinpointing pathway-specific alterations associated with
different aging patterns. These findings demonstrate the power of multi-omics
integration to decode the molecular landscape of aging and lay the groundwork
for personalized healthspan monitoring and precision strategies to prevent
age-related diseases.

Title: A Function Centric Perspective On Flat and Sharp Minima
Authors: Israel Mason-Williams, Gabryel Mason-Williams and Helen Yannakoudakis

\\
  Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Title: PubSub-VFL: Towards Efficient Two-Party Split Learning in Heterogeneous
  Environments via Publisher/Subscriber Architecture
Authors: Yi Liu, Yang Liu, Leqian Zheng, Jue Hong, Junjie Shi, Qingyou Yang, Ye

\\
  With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

  Scenarios

Comments: accepted to ICLR 2025
\\
  Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

  The increasing popularity of portable ECG systems and the growing demand for
privacy-compliant, energy-efficient real-time analysis require new approaches
to signal processing at the point of data acquisition. In this context, the
edge domain is acquiring increasing importance, as it not only reduces latency
times, but also enables an increased level of data security. The FACE project
aims to develop an innovative machine learning solution for analysing long-term
electrocardiograms that synergistically combines the strengths of edge and
cloud computing. In this thesis, various pre-processing steps of ECG signals
are analysed with regard to their applicability in the project. The selection
of suitable methods in the edge area is based in particular on criteria such as
energy efficiency, processing capability and real-time capability.

  With the rise of modern search and recommendation platforms, insufficient
collaborative information of cold-start items exacerbates the Matthew effect of
existing platform items, challenging platform diversity and becoming a
longstanding issue. Existing methods align items' side content with
collaborative information to transfer collaborative signals from
high-popularity items to cold-start items. However, these methods fail to
account for the asymmetry between collaboration and content, nor the
fine-grained differences among items. To address these issues, we propose
SMILE, an item representation enhancement approach based on fused alignment of
semantic IDs. Specifically, we use RQ-OPQ encoding to quantize item content and
collaborative information, followed by a two-step alignment: RQ encoding
transfers shared collaborative signals across items, while OPQ encoding learns
differentiated information of items. Comprehensive offline experiments on
large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate superiority of SMILE, and rigorous
online A/B tests confirm statistically significant improvements: item CTR
+1.66%, buyers +1.57%, and order volume +2.17%.

Title: Rethinking Knowledge Distillation: A Data Dependent Regulariser With a
  Negative Asymmetric Payoff
Authors: Israel Mason-Williams, Gabryel Mason-Williams and Helen Yannakoudakis
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 45 pages, 24 figures and 104 tables
\\
  Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

Title: Learning-To-Measure: In-context Active Feature Acquisition
Authors: Yuta Kobayashi, Zilin Jing, Jiayu Yao, Hongseok Namkoong, Shalmali
  Joshi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

Title: Designing Tools with Control Confidence
Authors: Ajith Anil Meera, Abian Torres and Pablo Lanillos
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Prehistoric humans invented stone tools for specialized tasks by not just
maximizing the tool's immediate goal-completion accuracy, but also increasing
their confidence in the tool for later use under similar settings. This factor
contributed to the increased robustness of the tool, i.e., the least
performance deviations under environmental uncertainties. However, the current
autonomous tool design frameworks solely rely on performance optimization,
without considering the agent's confidence in tool use for repeated use. Here,
we take a step towards filling this gap by i) defining an optimization
framework for task-conditioned autonomous hand tool design for robots, where
ii) we introduce a neuro-inspired control confidence term into the optimization
routine that helps the agent to design tools with higher robustness. Through
rigorous simulations using a robotic arm, we show that tools designed with
control confidence as the objective function are more robust to environmental
uncertainties during tool use than a pure accuracy-driven objective. We further
show that adding control confidence to the objective function for tool design
provides a balance between the robustness and goal accuracy of the designed
tools under control perturbations. Finally, we show that our CMAES-based
evolutionary optimization strategy for autonomous tool design outperforms other
state-of-the-art optimizers by designing the optimal tool within the fewest
iterations. Code: https://github.com/ajitham123/Tool_design_control_confidence.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

Title: Aixel: A Unified, Adaptive and Extensible System for AI-powered Data
  Analysis
Authors: Meihui Zhang, Liming Wang, Chi Zhang, Zhaojing Luo
Categories: cs.DB cs.AI
\\
  A growing trend in modern data analysis is the integration of data management
with learning, guided by accuracy, latency, and cost requirements. In practice,
applications draw data of different formats from many sources. In the
meanwhile, the objectives and budgets change over time. Existing systems handle
these applications across databases, analysis libraries, and tuning services.
Such fragmentation leads to complex user interaction, limited adaptability,
suboptimal performance, and poor extensibility across components. To address
these challenges, we present Aixel, a unified, adaptive, and extensible system
for AI-powered data analysis. The system organizes work across four layers:
application, task, model, and data. The task layer provides a declarative
interface to capture user intent, which is parsed into an executable operator
plan. An optimizer compiles and schedules this plan to meet specified goals in
accuracy, latency, and cost. The task layer coordinates the execution of data
and model operators, with built-in support for reuse and caching to improve
efficiency. The model layer offers versioned storage for index, metadata,
tensors, and model artifacts. It supports adaptive construction, task-aligned
drift detection, and safe updates that reuse shared components. The data layer
provides unified data management capabilities, including indexing,
constraint-aware discovery, task-aligned selection, and comprehensive feature
management. With the above designed layers, Aixel delivers a user friendly,
adaptive, efficient, and extensible system.

Title: SG-XDEAT: Sparsity-Guided Cross-Dimensional and Cross-Encoding Attention
  with Target-Aware Conditioning in Tabular Learning
Authors: Chih-Chuan Cheng, Yi-Ju Tseng
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

  Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

Title: From Delegates to Trustees: How Optimizing for Long-Term Interests
  Shapes Bias and Alignment in LLM
Authors: Suyash Fulay, Jocelyn Zhu, Michiel Bakker
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising accuracy in predicting
survey responses and policy preferences, which has increased interest in their
potential to represent human interests in various domains. Most existing
research has focused on behavioral cloning, effectively evaluating how well
models reproduce individuals' expressed preferences. Drawing on theories of
political representation, we highlight an underexplored design trade-off:
whether AI systems should act as delegates, mirroring expressed preferences, or
as trustees, exercising judgment about what best serves an individual's
interests. This trade-off is closely related to issues of LLM sycophancy, where
models can encourage behavior or validate beliefs that may be aligned with a
user's short-term preferences, but is detrimental to their long-term interests.
Through a series of experiments simulating votes on various policy issues in
the U.S. context, we apply a temporal utility framework that weighs short and
long-term interests (simulating a trustee role) and compare voting outcomes to
behavior-cloning models (simulating a delegate). We find that trustee-style
predictions weighted toward long-term interests produce policy decisions that
align more closely with expert consensus on well-understood issues, but also
show greater bias toward models' default stances on topics lacking clear
agreement. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off in designing AI
systems to represent human interests. Delegate models better preserve user
autonomy but may diverge from well-supported policy positions, while trustee
models can promote welfare on well-understood issues yet risk paternalism and
bias on subjective topics.

  Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or

a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

  There is growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to
automate and support complex decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear
how algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic
understanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge
assignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges.
Specifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation
Challenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \$500,000
to student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where
high-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based
judge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE),
and deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against
human expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on
$309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we
found no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the
two approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated
$3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an
excellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a
full week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during
deployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level
matching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency,
underscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human
decision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings.

Title: Beyond Postconditions: Can Large Language Models infer Formal Contracts
  for Automatic Software Verification?
Authors: Cedric Richter and Heike Wehrheim
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.PL
Comments: under submission
\\
  Automatic software verifiers have become increasingly effective at the task
of checking software against (formal) specifications. Yet, their adoption in
practice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world
code. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal
postconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function
names, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as
specifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to
suggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to
be false alarms.
  To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from
natural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the
process, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate
informal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of
postconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and
compare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative
power of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of
automatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with
different LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation
nl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at
generating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the
generated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from
correct behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional
contracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions
alone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally

Title: Hierarchical Federated Learning for Crop Yield Prediction in Smart
  Agricultural Production Systems

\\
  In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

Title: HYPE: Hybrid Planning with Ego Proposal-Conditioned Predictions
Authors: Hang Yu, Julian Jordan, Julian Schmidt, Silvan Lindner, Alessandro
  Canevaro, and Wilhelm Stork
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Safe and interpretable motion planning in complex urban environments needs to
reason about bidirectional multi-agent interactions. This reasoning requires to
estimate the costs of potential ego driving maneuvers. Many existing planners
generate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by
optimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires
a cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a
cost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex
urban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego
proposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal
trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions,
we introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling
consistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost
function design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance,
requiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms. Evaluations on large-scale
real-world benchmarks nuPlan and DeepUrban show that HYPE effectively achieves
state-of-the-art performance, especially in safety and adaptability.

Title: Disentangling Neurodegeneration with Brain Age Gap Prediction Models: A
  Graph Signal Processing Perspective
Authors: Saurabh Sihag, Gonzalo Mateos, Alejandro Ribeiro
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI q-bio.QM
Comments: Accepted for publication in IEEE Signal Processing Magazine
\\
  Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal
structure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through
reductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural
MRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical
sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and
heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy
aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age
gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain
age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's
predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The
resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with
recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and
severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their
methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical
populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces
a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in
graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks
(GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the
anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong
theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust
estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP,
machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path
forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research
directions in personalized medicine.

  This study examines elite-driven political communication on Telegram during
the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, the first large-scale European war in the
social media era. Using a unique dataset of Telegram public posts from
Ukrainian and Russian policymakers (2019-2024), we analyze changes in
communication volume, thematic content, and actor engagement following Russia's
2022 full-scale invasion. Our findings show a sharp increase in Telegram
activity after the invasion, particularly among ruling-party policymakers.
Ukrainian policymakers initially focused on war-related topics, but this
emphasis declined over time In contrast, Russian policymakers largely avoided
war-related discussions, instead emphasizing unrelated topics, such as Western
crises, to distract public attention. We also identify differences in
communication strategies between large and small parties, as well as individual
policymakers. Our findings shed light on how policymakers adapt to wartime
communication challenges and offer critical insights into the dynamics of
online political discourse during times of war.

Title: Task-Aware Reduction for Scalable LLM-Database Systems

Comments: Preprint. Accepted for presentation at the Workshop on Language
  Models and Databases (LMD), co-located with CASCON 2025 (IEEE). The final
  version will appear in IEEE Xplore
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to data-intensive
workflows, from database querying to developer observability. Yet the
effectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and
noise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring
streams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally
unsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in
LLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but
the challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In
this paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention
budget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design
principle for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as
compression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most
relevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building
benchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating
token-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our
vision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in
noisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable
LLM--data integration.

Title: Don't Walk the Line: Boundary Guidance for Filtered Generation
Authors: Sarah Ball and Andreas Haupt
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
Comments: 9 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables
\\
  Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

\\
  Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

  Deep Research (DR) agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform
complex, multi-step research by decomposing tasks, retrieving online
information, and synthesizing detailed reports. However, the misuse of LLMs
with such powerful capabilities can lead to even greater risks. This is
especially concerning in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive domains such as
biosecurity, where DR can generate a professional report containing detailed
forbidden knowledge. Unfortunately, we have found such risks in practice:
simply submitting a harmful query, which a standalone LLM directly rejects, can
elicit a detailed and dangerous report from DR agents. This highlights the
elevated risks and underscores the need for a deeper safety analysis. Yet,
jailbreak methods designed for LLMs fall short in exposing such unique risks,
as they do not target the research ability of DR agents. To address this gap,
we propose two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection, which injects
malicious sub-goals into the agent's plan; and Intent Hijack, which reframes
harmful queries as academic research questions. We conducted extensive
experiments across different LLMs and various safety benchmarks, including
general and biosecurity forbidden prompts. These experiments reveal 3 key
findings: (1) Alignment of the LLMs often fail in DR agents, where harmful
prompts framed in academic terms can hijack agent intent; (2) Multi-step
planning and execution weaken the alignment, revealing systemic vulnerabilities
that prompt-level safeguards cannot address; (3) DR agents not only bypass
refusals but also produce more coherent, professional, and dangerous content,
compared with standalone LLMs. These results demonstrate a fundamental
misalignment in DR agents and call for better alignment techniques tailored to
DR agents. Code and datasets are available at

  Recent advances in the audio language modeling (ALM) domain tackle audio
understanding and text-to-audio generation as separate tasks. Very few studies
attempt to unify these tasks -- an essential step toward advanced multimodal
reasoning. This paper introduces U}nified Audio Language Model (UALM), which
aims to unify audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and multimodal
reasoning in a single model. To achieve this goal, we first present UALM-Gen, a
text-to-audio language model that directly predicts audio tokens and is
comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based models. We then demonstrate,
using proper data blending, training recipes, and inference techniques, that
our single UALM model matches the quality of state-of-the-art specialized
models in audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and text reasoning.
Furthermore, we present UALM-Reason, a multimodal reasoning model that utilizes
both text and audio in the intermediate thinking steps to facilitate complex
generation tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in audio
research of cross-modal generative reasoning, with its effectiveness confirmed
by subjective evaluations.

  Web applications are prime targets for cyberattacks as gateways to critical
services and sensitive data. Traditional penetration testing is costly and
expertise-intensive, making it difficult to scale with the growing web
ecosystem. While language model agents show promise in cybersecurity, modern
web applications demand visual understanding, dynamic content handling, and
multi-step interactions that only computer-use agents (CUAs) can perform. Yet,
their ability to discover and exploit vulnerabilities through graphical
interfaces remains largely unexplored. We present HackWorld, the first
framework for systematically evaluating CUAs' capabilities to exploit web
application vulnerabilities via visual interaction. Unlike sanitized
benchmarks, HackWorld includes 36 real-world applications across 11 frameworks
and 7 languages, featuring realistic flaws such as injection vulnerabilities,
authentication bypasses, and unsafe input handling. Using a Capture-the-Flag
(CTF) setup, it tests CUAs' capacity to identify and exploit these weaknesses
while navigating complex web interfaces. Evaluation of state-of-the-art CUAs
reveals concerning trends: exploitation rates below 12% and low cybersecurity
awareness. CUAs often fail at multi-step attack planning and misuse security
tools. These results expose the current limitations of CUAs in web security
contexts and highlight opportunities for developing more security-aware agents
capable of effective vulnerability detection and exploitation.

  Recent attempts to interleave autoregressive (AR) sketchers with
diffusion-based refiners over continuous speech representations have shown
promise, but they remain brittle under distribution shift and offer limited
levers for controllability. We introduce DISTAR, a zero-shot text-to-speech
framework that operates entirely in a discrete residual vector quantization
(RVQ) code space and tightly couples an AR language model with a masked
diffusion model, without forced alignment or a duration predictor. Concretely,
DISTAR drafts block-level RVQ tokens with an AR language model and then
performs parallel masked-diffusion infilling conditioned on the draft to
complete the next block, yielding long-form synthesis with blockwise
parallelism while mitigating classic AR exposure bias. The discrete code space
affords explicit control at inference: DISTAR produces high-quality audio under
both greedy and sample-based decoding using classifier-free guidance, supports
trade-offs between robustness and diversity, and enables variable bit-rate and
controllable computation via RVQ layer pruning at test time. Extensive
experiments and ablations demonstrate that DISTAR surpasses state-of-the-art
zero-shot TTS systems in robustness, naturalness, and speaker/style
consistency, while maintaining rich output diversity. Audio samples are

Title: The Role of Parametric Injection-A Systematic Study of Parametric
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Authors: Minghao Tang, Shiyu Ni, Jingtong Wu, Zengxin Han, Keping Bi
Categories: cs.IR cs.CL
\\
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving external documents. As an emerging form of RAG, parametric
retrieval-augmented generation (PRAG) encodes documents as model parameters
(i.e., LoRA modules) and injects these representations into the model during
inference, enabling interaction between the LLM and documents at parametric
level. Compared with directly placing documents in the input context, PRAG is
more efficient and has the potential to offer deeper model-document
interaction. Despite its growing attention, the mechanism underlying parametric
injection remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic
study of PRAG to clarify the role of parametric injection, showing that
parameterized documents capture only partial semantic information of documents,
and relying on them alone yields inferior performance compared to interaction
at text level. However, these parametric representations encode high-level
document information that can enhance the model's understanding of documents
within the input context. When combined parameterized documents with textual
documents, the model can leverage relevant information more effectively and
become more robust to noisy inputs, achieving better performance than either
source alone. We recommend jointly using parameterized and textual documents
and advocate for increasing the information content of parametric
representations to advance PRAG.

Title: Content Anonymization for Privacy in Long-form Audio
Authors: Cristina Aggazzotti, Ashi Garg, Zexin Cai, Nicholas Andrews
Categories: cs.SD cs.CL
\\
  Voice anonymization techniques have been found to successfully obscure a
speaker's acoustic identity in short, isolated utterances in benchmarks such as
the VoicePrivacy Challenge. In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in
isolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone
calls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are
available, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple
utterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's
vocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their
voice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose new content
anonymization approaches. Our approach performs a contextual rewriting of the
transcripts in an ASR-TTS pipeline to eliminate speaker-specific style while
preserving meaning. We present results in a long-form telephone conversation
setting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on
voice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based
anonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility.
Overall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against
content-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure
anonymity in long-form audio.

  As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and
efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for
physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face
significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes
and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can
compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce
\our{} (\textbf{G}aussian \textbf{S}platting for \textbf{V}irtual
\textbf{E}nvironment \textbf{R}endering and \textbf{S}cene \textbf{E}diting), a
novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an
object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach
enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic
deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, \our{}
facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow.
Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting
developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers
a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D
manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current
state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study
involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is
statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation
and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting
and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms
that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing
its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.

Title: MosaicDiff: Training-free Structural Pruning for Diffusion Model
  Acceleration Reflecting Pretraining Dynamics
Authors: Bowei Guo, Shengkun Tang, Cong Zeng, Zhiqiang Shen
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
Comments: International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2025
\\
  Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  We present a one-shot LiDAR global localization algorithm featuring semantic
disambiguation ability based on a lightweight tri-layered scene graph. While
landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance
improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods,
landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We
propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with
continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared
with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained
geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for
correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle
layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a
tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend
for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF
(Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly
available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current
state-of-the-art.

Title: MAPS: Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies- A computational
  framework to align human and model explanations
Authors: Sabine Muzellec, Yousif Kashef Alghetaa, Simon Kornblith, and Kohitij
  Kar
Categories: q-bio.NC cs.CV
\\
  Human core object recognition depends on the selective use of visual
information, but the strategies guiding these choices are difficult to measure
directly. We present MAPS (Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies), a
behaviorally validated computational tool that tests whether explanations
derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also explain human vision.
MAPS converts attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs) and
compares image-by-image human accuracies on these minimal images with limited
pixel budgets with accuracies on the full stimuli. MAPS provides a principled
way to evaluate and choose among competing ANN interpretability methods. In
silico, EMI-based behavioral similarity between models reliably recovers the
ground-truth similarity computed from their attribution maps, establishing
which explanation methods best capture the model's strategy. When applied to
humans and macaques, MAPS identifies ANN-explanation combinations whose
explanations align most closely with biological vision, achieving the
behavioral validity of Bubble masks while requiring far fewer behavioral
trials. Because it needs only access to model attributions and a modest set of
behavioral data on the original images, MAPS avoids exhaustive psychophysics
while offering a scalable tool for adjudicating explanations and linking human
behavior, neural activity, and model decisions under a common standard.

naturally modeled as tensors, and recent completion methods integrating global
low rank priors with plug and play denoisers have demonstrated strong empirical
performance. However, these approaches often rely on empirical convergence
alone or unrealistic assumptions, such as deep denoisers acting as proximal
operators of implicit regularizers, which generally does not hold. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel tensor completion framework grounded in
the monotone inclusion paradigm, which unifies generalized low rank priors with
deep pseudo contractive denoisers and extends beyond traditional convex
optimization. Building on the Davis Yin splitting scheme, we develop the GTCTV
DPC algorithm and rigorously establish its global convergence. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GTCTV DPC consistently outperforms existing
methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly at low
sampling rates.

Title: Fast Visuomotor Policy for Robotic Manipulation
Authors: Jingkai Jia, Tong Yang, Xueyao Chen, Chenhuan Liu, Wenqiang Zhang
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  We present a fast and effective policy framework for robotic manipulation,
named Energy Policy, designed for high-frequency robotic tasks and
resource-constrained systems. Unlike existing robotic policies, Energy Policy
natively predicts multimodal actions in a single forward pass, enabling
high-precision manipulation at high speed. The framework is built upon two core
components. First, we adopt the energy score as the learning objective to
facilitate multimodal action modeling. Second, we introduce an energy MLP to
implement the proposed objective while keeping the architecture simple and
efficient. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated environments
and real-world robotic tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of Energy Policy.
The results show that Energy Policy matches or surpasses the performance of
state-of-the-art manipulation methods while significantly reducing
computational overhead. Notably, on the MimicGen benchmark, Energy Policy
achieves superior performance with at a faster inference compared to existing
approaches.

  Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations
that empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the
evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language
models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world
applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support,
unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we
introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that
addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural
design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme
to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning.
Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the
model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched
cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement
training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios
by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while
mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic
specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training
flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding
achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval
tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated
with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a
crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model
delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.158% and the 14-day LT gain of +0.144% in the
Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features
produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.08% AUC gain.

Title: Rationally Analyzing Shelby: Proving Incentive Compatibility in a
  Decentralized Storage Network
Authors: Michael Crystal, Guy Goren, Scott Duke Kominers
Categories: cs.GT cs.DC cs.MA
Comments: 23 pages, 1 figure
\\
  Decentralized storage is one of the most natural applications built on
blockchains and a central component of the Web3 ecosystem. Yet despite a decade
of active development -- from IPFS and Filecoin to more recent entrants -- most
of these storage protocols have received limited formal analysis of their
incentive properties. Claims of incentive compatibility are sometimes made, but
rarely proven. This gap matters: without well-designed incentives, a system may
distribute storage but fail to truly decentralize it.
  We analyze Shelby -- a storage network protocol recently proposed by Aptos
Labs and Jump Crypto -- and provide the first formal proof of its incentive
properties. Our game-theoretic model shows that while off-chain audits alone
collapse to universal shirking, Shelby's combination of peer audits with
occasional on-chain verification yields incentive compatibility under natural
parameter settings. We also examine coalition behavior and outline a simple
modification that strengthens the protocol's collusion-resilience.

\\
  Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Title: Should I Run My Cloud Benchmark on Black Friday?
Authors: S\"oren Henning, Adriano Vogel, Esteban Perez-Wohlfeil, Otmar Ertl,

Categories: cs.SE cs.DC cs.PF
Comments: Accepted for the 16th Symposium on Software Performance 2025
\\
  Benchmarks and performance experiments are frequently conducted in cloud
environments. However, their results are often treated with caution, as the
presumed high variability of performance in the cloud raises concerns about
reproducibility and credibility. In a recent study, we empirically quantified
the impact of this variability on benchmarking results by repeatedly executing
a stream processing application benchmark at different times of the day over
several months. Our analysis confirms that performance variability is indeed
observable at the application level, although it is less pronounced than often
assumed. The larger scale of our study compared to related work allowed us to
identify subtle daily and weekly performance patterns. We now extend this
investigation by examining whether a major global event, such as Black Friday,
affects the outcomes of performance benchmarks.

Title: Proof of Cloud: Data Center Execution Assurance for Confidential VMs
Authors: Filip Rezabek, Moe Mahhouk, Andrew Miller, Stefan Genchev, Quintus
  Kilbourn, Georg Carle, and Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach
Categories: cs.CR cs.DC
\\
  Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) protect data in use by running workloads
inside hardware-isolated environments. In doing so, they also inherit the
limitations of the underlying hardware. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs),
which enforce this isolation, explicitly exclude adversaries with physical
access from their threat model. Commercial TEEs, e.g., Intel TDX, thus assume
infrastructure providers do not physically exploit hardware and serve as
safeguards instead. This creates a tension: tenants must trust provider
integrity at the hardware layer, yet existing remote attestation offers no way
to verify that CVMs actually run on physically trusted platforms, leaving
today's CVM deployments unable to demonstrate that their guarantees align with
the TEE vendor's threat model.
  We bridge this confidence gap with Data Center Execution Assurance (DCEA), a
design generating "Proofs of Cloud". DCEA binds a CVM to its underlying
platform using vTPM-anchored measurements, ensuring CVM launch evidence and TPM
quotes refer to the same physical chassis.
  This takes advantage of the fact that data centers are often identifiable via
TPMs. Our approach applies to CVMs accessing vTPMs and running on top of
software stacks fully controlled by the cloud provider, as well as
single-tenant bare-metal deployments with discrete TPMs. We trust providers for
integrity (certificate issuance), but not for the confidentiality of
CVM-visible state. DCEA enables remote verification of a CVM's platform origin
and integrity, mitigating attacks like replay and attestation proxying. We
include a candidate implementation on Google Cloud and Intel TDX that leverages
Intel TXT for trusted launch. Our design refines CVMs' threat model and
provides a practical path for deploying high-assurance, confidential workloads
in minimally trusted environments.

Title: Mean-Field Games with Constraints
Authors: Anran Hu, Zijiu Lyu
Categories: math.OC cs.MA math.PR
\\
  This paper introduces a framework of Constrained Mean-Field Games (CMFGs),
where each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). This
formulation captures scenarios in which agents' strategies are subject to
feasibility, safety, or regulatory restrictions, thereby extending the scope of
classical mean field game (MFG) models. We first establish the existence of
CMFG equilibria under a strict feasibility assumption, and we further show
uniqueness under a classical monotonicity condition. To compute equilibria, we
develop Constrained Mean-Field Occupation Measure Optimization (CMFOMO), an
optimization-based scheme that parameterizes occupation measures and shows that
finding CMFG equilibria is equivalent to solving a single optimization problem
with convex constraints and bounded variables. CMFOMO does not rely on
uniqueness of the equilibria and can approximate all equilibria with arbitrary
accuracy. We further prove that CMFG equilibria induce $O(1 / \sqrt{N})$-Nash
equilibria in the associated constrained $N$-player games, thereby extending
the classical justification of MFGs as approximations for large but finite
systems. Numerical experiments on a modified Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible
(SIS) epidemic model with various constraints illustrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of the framework.

Title: Runtime Composition in Dynamic System of Systems: A Systematic Review of
  Challenges, Solutions, Tools, and Evaluation Methods
Authors: Muhammad Ashfaq, Ahmed R. Sadik, Teerath Das, Muhammad Waseem, Niko
  Makitalo, Tommi Mikkonen
Categories: cs.SE cs.MA
\\
  Context: Modern Systems of Systems (SoSs) increasingly operate in dynamic
environments (e.g., smart cities, autonomous vehicles) where runtime
composition -- the on-the-fly discovery, integration, and coordination of
constituent systems (CSs)--is crucial for adaptability. Despite growing
interest, the literature lacks a cohesive synthesis of runtime composition in
dynamic SoSs. Objective: This study synthesizes research on runtime composition
in dynamic SoSs and identifies core challenges, solution strategies, supporting
tools, and evaluation methods. Methods: We conducted a Systematic Literature
Review (SLR), screening 1,774 studies published between 2019 and 2024 and
selecting 80 primary studies for thematic analysis (TA). Results: Challenges
fall into four categories: modeling and analysis, resilient operations, system
orchestration, and heterogeneity of CSs. Solutions span seven areas:
co-simulation and digital twins, semantic ontologies, integration frameworks,
adaptive architectures, middleware, formal methods, and AI-driven resilience.
Service-oriented frameworks for composition and integration dominate tooling,
while simulation platforms support evaluation. Interoperability across tools,
limited cross-toolchain workflows, and the absence of standardized benchmarks
remain key gaps. Evaluation approaches include simulation-based,
implementation-driven, and human-centered studies, which have been applied in
domains such as smart cities, healthcare, defense, and industrial automation.
Conclusions: The synthesis reveals tensions, including autonomy versus
coordination, the modeling-reality gap, and socio-technical integration. It
calls for standardized evaluation metrics, scalable decentralized
architectures, and cross-domain frameworks. The analysis aims to guide
researchers and practitioners in developing and implementing dynamically
composable SoSs.
