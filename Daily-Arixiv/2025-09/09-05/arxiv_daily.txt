Title: Attention of a Kiss: Exploring Attention Maps in Video Diffusion for
  XAIxArts
Authors: Adam Cole, Mick Grierson
Categories: cs.AI cs.MM
Comments: 3rd international workshop on eXplainable AI for the Arts (XAIxArts)
  at the ACM Creativity and Cognition Conference 2025
\\
  This paper presents an artistic and technical investigation into the
attention mechanisms of video diffusion transformers. Inspired by early video
artists who manipulated analog video signals to create new visual aesthetics,
this study proposes a method for extracting and visualizing cross-attention
maps in generative video models. Built on the open-source Wan model, our tool
provides an interpretable window into the temporal and spatial behavior of
attention in text-to-video generation. Through exploratory probes and an
artistic case study, we examine the potential of attention maps as both
analytical tools and raw artistic material. This work contributes to the
growing field of Explainable AI for the Arts (XAIxArts), inviting artists to
reclaim the inner workings of AI as a creative medium.

Title: Perception Graph for Cognitive Attack Reasoning in Augmented Reality
Authors: Rongqian Chen, Shu Hong, Rifatul Islam, Mahdi Imani, G. Gary Tan, Tian
  Lan
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Accepted by ACM MobiHoc XR Security workshop 2025
\\
  Augmented reality (AR) systems are increasingly deployed in tactical
environments, but their reliance on seamless human-computer interaction makes
them vulnerable to cognitive attacks that manipulate a user's perception and
severely compromise user decision-making. To address this challenge, we
introduce the Perception Graph, a novel model designed to reason about human
perception within these systems. Our model operates by first mimicking the
human process of interpreting key information from an MR environment and then
representing the outcomes using a semantically meaningful structure. We
demonstrate how the model can compute a quantitative score that reflects the
level of perception distortion, providing a robust and measurable method for
detecting and analyzing the effects of such cognitive attacks.

Title: SynDelay: A Synthetic Dataset for Delivery Delay Prediction
Authors: Liming Xu and Yunbo Long and Alexandra Brintrup
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: This paper incldues 1 figure and 2 tables
\\
  Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming supply chain management, yet
progress in predictive tasks -- such as delivery delay prediction -- remains
constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, openly available datasets.
Existing datasets are often proprietary, small, or inconsistently maintained,
hindering reproducibility and benchmarking. We present SynDelay, a synthetic
dataset designed for delivery delay prediction. Generated using an advanced
generative model trained on real-world data, SynDelay preserves realistic
delivery patterns while ensuring privacy. Although not entirely free of noise
or inconsistencies, it provides a challenging and practical testbed for
advancing predictive modelling. To support adoption, we provide baseline
results and evaluation metrics as initial benchmarks, serving as reference
points rather than state-of-the-art claims. SynDelay is publicly available
through the Supply Chain Data Hub, an open initiative promoting dataset sharing
and benchmarking in supply chain AI. We encourage the community to contribute
datasets, models, and evaluation practices to advance research in this area.

Title: MVRS: The Multimodal Virtual Reality Stimuli-based Emotion Recognition
  Dataset
Authors: Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi, Atiye Ilanloo
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Automatic emotion recognition has become increasingly important with the rise
of AI, especially in fields like healthcare, education, and automotive systems.
However, there is a lack of multimodal datasets, particularly involving body
motion and physiological signals, which limits progress in the field. To
address this, the MVRS dataset is introduced, featuring synchronized recordings
from 13 participants aged 12 to 60 exposed to VR based emotional stimuli
(relaxation, fear, stress, sadness, joy). Data were collected using eye
tracking (via webcam in a VR headset), body motion (Kinect v2), and EMG and GSR
signals (Arduino UNO), all timestamp aligned. Participants followed a unified
protocol with consent and questionnaires. Features from each modality were
extracted, fused using early and late fusion techniques, and evaluated with
classifiers to confirm the datasets quality and emotion separability, making
MVRS a valuable contribution to multimodal affective computing.

Title: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Personalized Guidance in
  AI-Enhanced Learning
Authors: Bo Yuan and Jiazi Hu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent
assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations
within authentic learning scenarios remain limited. This study conducts an
empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task that
simulates a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset comprising a student's
answers to ten questions of mixed formats with correctness labels, each LLM is
required to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components,
(ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance
for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, we employ Gemini
as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons along various dimensions:
accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the
Bradley-Terry model indicate that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing
feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts,
while DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower
consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as
advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide
methodological guidance for future empirical research on LLM-driven
personalized learning.

Title: SasAgent: Multi-Agent AI System for Small-Angle Scattering Data Analysis
Authors: Lijie Ding and Changwoo Do
Categories: cs.AI cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.MA
Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures
\\
  We introduce SasAgent, a multi-agent AI system powered by large language
models (LLMs) that automates small-angle scattering (SAS) data analysis by
leveraging tools from the SasView software and enables user interaction via
text input. SasAgent features a coordinator agent that interprets user prompts
and delegates tasks to three specialized agents for scattering length density
(SLD) calculation, synthetic data generation, and experimental data fitting.
These agents utilize LLM-friendly tools to execute tasks efficiently. These
tools, including the model data tool, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
documentation tool, bump fitting tool, and SLD calculator tool, are derived
from the SasView Python library. A user-friendly Gradio-based interface
enhances user accessibility. Through diverse examples, we demonstrate
SasAgent's ability to interpret complex prompts, calculate SLDs, generate
accurate scattering data, and fit experimental datasets with high precision.
This work showcases the potential of LLM-driven AI systems to streamline
scientific workflows and enhance automation in SAS research.

Title: Characterizing Fitness Landscape Structures in Prompt Engineering
Authors: Arend Hintze
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  While prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial technique for optimizing
large language model performance, the underlying optimization landscape remains
poorly understood. Current approaches treat prompt optimization as a black-box
problem, applying sophisticated search algorithms without characterizing the
landscape topology they navigate. We present a systematic analysis of fitness
landscape structures in prompt engineering using autocorrelation analysis
across semantic embedding spaces. Through experiments on error detection tasks
with two distinct prompt generation strategies -- systematic enumeration (1,024
prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts) -- we reveal
fundamentally different landscape topologies. Systematic prompt generation
yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits
non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic
distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes.
Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories reveals varying
degrees of ruggedness across different error types. Our findings provide an
empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt
engineering landscapes.

Authors: Andreas Motzfeldt, Joakim Edin, Casper L. Christensen, Christian

Categories: cs.AI cs.MA
Comments: EMNLP Findings 2025
\\
  In medical coding, experts map unstructured clinical notes to alphanumeric
codes for diagnoses and procedures. We introduce Code Like Humans: a new
agentic framework for medical coding with large language models. It implements
official coding guidelines for human experts, and it is the first solution that
can support the full ICD-10 coding system (+70K labels). It achieves the best
performance to date on rare diagnosis codes (fine-tuned discriminative
classifiers retain an advantage for high-frequency codes, to which they are
limited). Towards future work, we also contribute an analysis of system
performance and identify its `blind spots' (codes that are systematically
undercoded).

Title: Murphys Laws of AI Alignment: Why the Gap Always Wins
Authors: Madhava Gaikwad
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 21 pages
MSC-class: 68T01, 68T20, 68Q87
\\
  Large language models are increasingly aligned to human preferences through
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methods such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, and RLAIF. While
effective, these methods exhibit recurring failure patterns i.e., reward
hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization. We introduce the
concept of the Alignment Gap, a unifying lens for understanding recurring
failures in feedback-based alignment. Using a KL-tilting formalism, we
illustrate why optimization pressure tends to amplify divergence between proxy
rewards and true human intent. We organize these failures into a catalogue of
Murphys Laws of AI Alignment, and propose the Alignment Trilemma as a way to
frame trade-offs among optimization strength, value capture, and
generalization. Small-scale empirical studies serve as illustrative support.
Finally, we propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure,
Shift) as practical design levers. Our contribution is not a definitive
impossibility theorem but a perspective that reframes alignment debates around
structural limits and trade-offs, offering clearer guidance for future design.

Title: From Image Generation to Infrastructure Design: a Multi-agent Pipeline
  for Street Design Generation
Authors: Chenguang Wang, Xiang Yan, Yilong Dai, Ziyi Wang, Susu Xu
Categories: cs.AI cs.CV cs.CY cs.HC
Comments: 21 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation
infrastructure planning and facility design.

Title: TreeGPT: A Novel Hybrid Architecture for Abstract Syntax Tree Processing
  with Global Parent-Child Aggregation
Authors: Zixi Li
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Code available at: https://github.com/lizixi-0x2F/TreeGPT
\\
  We introduce TreeGPT, a novel neural architecture that combines
transformer-based attention mechanisms with global parent-child aggregation for
processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in neural program synthesis tasks.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on sequential processing or
graph neural networks, TreeGPT employs a hybrid design that leverages both
self-attention for capturing local dependencies and a specialized Tree
Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) for modeling hierarchical tree structures
through iterative message passing.
  The core innovation lies in our Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism,
formalized as: $$h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma \Big( h_i^{(0)} + W_{pc} \sum_{(p,c) \in
E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b \Big)$$ where $h_i^{(t)}$ represents the
hidden state of node $i$ at iteration $t$, $E_i$ denotes all parent-child edges
involving node $i$, and $f(h_p, h_c)$ is an edge aggregation function. This
formulation enables each node to progressively aggregate information from the
entire tree structure through $T$ iterations.
  Our architecture integrates optional enhancements including gated aggregation
with learnable edge weights, residual connections for gradient stability, and
bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down
dependencies. We evaluate TreeGPT on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, a challenging
visual reasoning benchmark requiring abstract pattern recognition and rule
inference. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeGPT achieves 96\%
accuracy, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3\%),
large-scale models like Grok-4 (15.9\%), and specialized program synthesis
methods like SOAR (52\%) while using only 1.5M parameters. Our comprehensive
ablation study reveals that edge projection is the most critical component,
with the combination of edge projection and gating achieving optimal
performance.

Title: OccVLA: Vision-Language-Action Model with Implicit 3D Occupancy
  Supervision
Authors: Ruixun Liu, Lingyu Kong, Derun Li, Hang Zhao
Categories: cs.AI cs.RO
\\
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language
reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is
critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges:
(1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations
without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial
details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language
pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework
that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal
reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs,
OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory
signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly
from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit
reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance
degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and
demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks,
offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for
autonomous driving.

Title: MSRFormer: Road Network Representation Learning using Multi-scale
  Feature Fusion of Heterogeneous Spatial Interactions
Authors: Jian Yang, Jiahui Wu, Li Fang, Hongchao Fan, Bianying Zhang, Huijie
  Zhao, Guangyi Yang, Rui Xin, Xiong You
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep
learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road
networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate
representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from
neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus
on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents
MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that
integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow
heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution
to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies
scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of
road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,
MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple
scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,
which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road
network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that
MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The
performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more
from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in
complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the
most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework
for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights
distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow
heterogeneity of spatial interactions.

  Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Title: Hyperbolic Large Language Models
Authors: Sarang Patil, Zeyong Zhang, Yiran Huang, Tengfei Ma, Mengjia Xu
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 32 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and
demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural
language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding,
text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world
data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein
networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and
linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively
learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from
these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area.
Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures,
hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity
as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across
domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we
provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in
LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance
semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the
paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs
(HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log
maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4)
hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications
and outline future research directions. A repository of key papers, models,
datasets, and code implementations is available at

  With the evolution of generative AI, multi - agent systems leveraging large -

However, these systems face challenges in quantifying agent performance and
lack mechanisms to assess agent credibility. To address these issues, we

scoring mechanism to measure agent honesty and capability, and integrates an
Upper Confidence Bound - based strategy to enhance agent selection efficiency.
Experiments show that DRF significantly improves task completion quality and
collaboration efficiency in logical reasoning and code - generation tasks,
offering a new approach for multi - agent systems to handle large - scale

  Decision-making under uncertainty in energy management is complicated by
unknown parameters hindering optimal strategies, particularly in Battery Energy
Storage System (BESS) operations. Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat
forecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors
to cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors
rather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning
(DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and
optimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily
on synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their
practical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional
challenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection
constraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work
leverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations
and improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework
suitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while
optimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on
a novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods
against PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL
yields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the
performance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without
AFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in
real-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and
reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic
benefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar
challenges.

  Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in
their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes
patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built
on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL)
setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight
LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on
conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation
strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding
assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which
includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates
that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient
education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it
received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that
even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can
successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn
interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced
communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot
surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the
framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying
low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains,
broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.

Title: MapAgent: A Hierarchical Agent for Geospatial Reasoning with Dynamic Map
  Tool Integration

\\
  Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most
existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web
automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,
multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,
we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with
customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial
reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools
uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different
geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level
planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to
specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then
design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs
adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the
query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)
operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces
cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise
coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse

Title: Rethinking Reasoning Quality in Large Language Models through Enhanced
  Chain-of-Thought via RL
Authors: Haoyang He, Zihua Rong, Kun Ji, Chenyang Li, Qing Huang, Chong Xia,
  Lan Yang, Honggang Zhang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for
strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the
rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming
benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to
whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.
Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical
depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We
propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward
framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning
Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that
demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising
the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage
decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a
validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous
assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive
reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a
comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B
model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing
steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The
model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning
datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how
RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing
formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are
available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.

  While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Title: From Long to Short: LLMs Excel at Trimming Own Reasoning Chains
Authors: Wei Han, Geng Zhan, Sicheng Yu, Chenyu Wang, Bryan Hooi
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: 21 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables
\\
  O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user
experience.

adaptive learning through self-play. Additionally, we analyze its learning

Title: Proof2Silicon: Prompt Repair for Verified Code and Hardware Generation
  via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Manvi Jha, Jiaxin Wan, Deming Chen
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal
verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical
domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed
PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that
iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically
steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly
fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis
framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the
generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural
language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's
verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring
Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs
into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)
employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a
challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization
consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by
up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis
success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis
flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for
LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language
specification and silicon realization.

\\
  Personalized AI assistants often struggle to incorporate complex personal
data and causal knowledge, leading to generic advice that lacks explanatory
power. We propose REMI, a Causal Schema Memory architecture for a multimodal
lifestyle agent that integrates a personal causal knowledge graph, a causal
reasoning engine, and a schema based planning module. The idea is to deliver
explainable, personalized recommendations in domains like fashion, personal
wellness, and lifestyle planning. Our architecture uses a personal causal graph
of the user's life events and habits, performs goal directed causal traversals
enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves
adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. A Large Language
Model orchestrates these components, producing answers with transparent causal
explanations. We outline the CSM system design and introduce new evaluation
metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization
Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its
performance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context
aware, user aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents. This work
demonstrates a novel approach to memory augmented, causal reasoning in
personalized agents, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy
AI lifestyle assistants.

  Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as
finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models
(LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often
struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations
inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves
computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems
frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true
autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven
table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool
invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox
environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)
exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt
strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool
usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize
multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy
Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality
trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of
low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and
more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks
demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to
competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy
and computational precision.

\\
  Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more
insights into our methodologies.

Title: From Implicit Exploration to Structured Reasoning: Leveraging Guideline
  and Refinement for LLMs
Authors: Jiaxiang Chen, Zhuo Wang, Mingxi Zou, Zhucong Li, Zhijian Zhou, Song
  Wang, Zenglin Xu
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose reasoning, showing
strong performance across diverse tasks. However, existing methods often rely
on implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided
reasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning
paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To
address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit
exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we
extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and
reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these
guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct
errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four
additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.
Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability
and generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly
support cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised
fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

Title: Can AI Make Energy Retrofit Decisions? An Evaluation of Large Language
  Models
Authors: Lei Shu, Dong Zhao
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Conventional approaches to building energy retrofit decision making suffer
from limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in
diverse residential contexts. With the growth of Smart and Connected
Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help
by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable
recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok,
Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives:
maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period
(sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy,
consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49
US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up
to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning.
Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical
decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement
across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others.
LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to
technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering
style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual
awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision
making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are
needed for reliable practice.

\\
  Questionnaire-based surveys are foundational to social science research and
public policymaking, yet traditional survey methods remain costly,
time-consuming, and often limited in scale. This paper explores a new paradigm:
simulating virtual survey respondents using Large Language Models (LLMs). We
introduce two novel simulation settings, namely Partial Attribute Simulation
(PAS) and Full Attribute Simulation (FAS), to systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate accurate and demographically coherent responses. In
PAS, the model predicts missing attributes based on partial respondent
profiles, whereas FAS involves generating complete synthetic datasets under
both zero-context and context-enhanced conditions. We curate a comprehensive
benchmark suite, LLM-S^3 (Large Language Model-based Sociodemographic Survey
Simulation), that spans 11 real-world public datasets across four sociological
domains. Our evaluation of multiple mainstream LLMs (GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA
3.0/3.1-8B) reveals consistent trends in prediction performance, highlights
failure modes, and demonstrates how context and prompt design impact simulation
fidelity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey
simulations, offering scalable and cost-effective tools for sociological
research and policy evaluation. Our code and dataset are available at:

\\
  In online second-hand marketplaces, multi-turn bargaining is a crucial part
of seller-buyer interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as seller
agents, negotiating with buyers on behalf of sellers under given business
constraints. A critical ability for such agents is to track and accurately
interpret cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations, which directly
impacts bargaining effectiveness. We introduce a multi-turn evaluation
framework for measuring the bargaining ability of seller agents in e-commerce
dialogues. The framework tests whether an agent can extract and track buyer
intents. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale e-commerce bargaining
benchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks; (2) a
turn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind (ToM) with annotated
buyer intents, moving beyond outcome-only metrics; and (3) an automated

  Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must
balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a
novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in
3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level
environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a
testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement
decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level
mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint
system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired
with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament
data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays
generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original
game. Our publicly available simulation environment provides a valuable tool
for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior
generation.

  This study presents DiagCoT, a multi-stage framework that applies supervised

DiagCoT combines contrastive image-report tuning for domain alignment,
chain-of-thought supervision to capture inferential logic, and reinforcement

Title: Tree of Agents: Improving Long-Context Capabilities of Large Language
  Models through Multi-Perspective Reasoning
Authors: Song Yu, Xiaofei Xu, Ke Deng, Li Li, Lin Tian
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 19 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling
long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where
information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized.
Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key
information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention
dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a
multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed
by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents
dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along
tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders
for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and
reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate
prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant
performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that
TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple
baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger
commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code

Title: HyFedRAG: A Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for
  Heterogeneous and Privacy-Sensitive Data
Authors: Cheng Qian, Hainan Zhang, Yongxin Tong, Hong-Wei Zheng, Zhiming Zheng

Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive
data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans
SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties
retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of
traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge
devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient
Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an
edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across
diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:
(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which
supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and
unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into
standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs
integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate
lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three
anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,
de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize
response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier
caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,
and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate
that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,
generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable
and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data,
unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

Title: Accelerate Scaling of LLM Alignment via Quantifying the Coverage and
  Depth of Instruction Set
Authors: Chengwei Wu, Li Du, Hanyu Zhao, Yiming Ju, Jiapu Wang, Tengfei Pan
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  With the growing demand for applying large language models to downstream
tasks, improving model alignment performance and efficiency has become crucial.
Such a process involves selecting informative instructions from a candidate
pool. However, due to the complexity of instruction set distributions, the key
factors driving the performance of aligned models remain unclear. As a result,
current instruction set refinement methods fail to improve performance as the
instruction pool expands continuously. To address this issue, we first
investigate the key factors that influence the relationship between instruction
dataset distribution and aligned model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a novel instruction data selection method. We identify that the depth
of instructions and the coverage of the semantic space are the crucial factors
determining downstream performance, which could explain over 70\% of the model
loss on the development set. We then design an instruction selection algorithm
to simultaneously maximize the depth and semantic coverage of the selected
instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to
state-of-the-art baseline methods, it can sustainably improve model performance
at a faster pace and thus achieve \emph{``Accelerated Scaling''}.

hybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using
predefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously

of 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation
metrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can
be significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments
show that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and
efficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation
capabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a
foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and

Title: MORSE: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning via Strategy Evolution for
  Supply Chain Optimization
Authors: Niki Kotecha and Ehecatl Antonio del Rio Chanona
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In supply chain management, decision-making often involves balancing multiple
conflicting objectives, such as cost reduction, service level improvement, and
environmental sustainability. Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,
such as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in
real-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an
approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to address these challenges for dynamic
multi-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to
search the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front
of policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of
policies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system
objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.
We also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate
risk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,
showcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study. The proposed
strategy not only improves decision-making efficiency but also offers a more
robust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply
chains.

Title: Scaling up Multi-Turn Off-Policy RL and Multi-Agent Tree Search for LLM
  Step-Provers
Authors: Ran Xin, Zeyu Zheng, Yanchen Nie, Kun Yuan, Xia Xiao
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem
proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by
challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and
inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system
designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary
innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for
continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This
framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage
expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and
periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail
long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced
multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference
time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level
planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler
subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,
enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by
leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to
scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics
benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F
and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal
mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of
broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon
multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

  The cycle of scientific discovery is frequently bottlenecked by the slow,
manual creation of software to support computational experiments. To address
this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software
whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) and Tree Search (TS) to systematically improve the quality metric
and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system
achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research
ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated
across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel
methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed
methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that
outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting
COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software
for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series
forecasting and numerical solution of integrals. By devising and implementing
novel solutions to diverse tasks, the system represents a significant step
towards accelerating scientific progress.

  Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding
in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper
proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like
cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a
plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and
Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select"
cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to
guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves
cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.
Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional
entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing
unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and
Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with
their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields
consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline
combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,
demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch"
reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

  Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

  Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment
for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties
with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on
Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.

Title: Another Turn, Better Output? A Turn-Wise Analysis of Iterative LLM
  Prompting
Authors: Shashidhar Reddy Javaji, Bhavul Gauri, Zining Zhu
Categories: cs.AI cs.HC
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we
still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We
present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation,
code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task,
utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to
targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with
domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus
reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and
track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement
across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and
tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in
math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,
vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts
reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;
speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and
drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation
moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little
semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,
elaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration
measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or
switch strategies.

Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

Title: Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models Is Not Effective for
  Knowledge-Intensive Tasks Yet
Authors: James Xu Zhao, Bryan Hooi, See-Kiong Ng
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: 20 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables
\\
  Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

Title: Paper2Agent: Reimagining Research Papers As Interactive and Reliable AI
  Agents
Authors: Jiacheng Miao, Joe R. Davis, Jonathan K. Pritchard, James Zou
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own
work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this
challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into
dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for
knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI
co-scientists.

\\
  Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning
diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However,
they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with
gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,
thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often
need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired
aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address
the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that
predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time
steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are
interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids
over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic
Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as
text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in
response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the
reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model
with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its
human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.

Our experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering
granularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization
strategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and
phonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary,
uncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns. Additionally, we
explore the impact of clustering data selection on model robustness,
highlighting the importance of domain matching between discretization training
and target applications.

Title: Beyond ROUGE: N-Gram Subspace Features for LLM Hallucination Detection
Authors: Jerry Li, Evangelos Papalexakis
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness across a wide
variety of tasks involving natural language, however, a fundamental problem of
hallucinations still plagues these models, limiting their trustworthiness in
generating consistent, truthful information. Detecting hallucinations has
quickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty
estimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency
checks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics,
such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth
necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor
from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by
encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between
factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor
decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these
as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset and
demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines, as well as
competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.

  LLMs
Authors: Jiacheng Wei, Faguo Wu, Xiao Zhang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures, conference
\\
  Large language models are unable to continuously adapt and learn from new
data during reasoning at inference time. To address this limitation, we propose
that complex reasoning tasks be decomposed into atomic subtasks and introduce
SAGE, a trigger-guided dynamic fine-tuning framework that enables adaptive
updates during reasoning at inference time. SAGE consists of three key
components: (1) a Trigger module that detects reasoning failures through
multiple evaluation metrics in real time; (2) a Trigger Buffer module that
clusters anomaly samples using a streaming clustering process with HDBSCAN,
followed by stability checks and similarity-based merging; and (3) a Lora Store
module that dynamically optimizes parameter updates with an adapter pool for
knowledge retention. Evaluation results show that SAGE demonstrates excellent
accuracy, robustness, and stability on the atomic reasoning subtask through
dynamic knowledge updating during test time.

Title: Talk Isn't Always Cheap: Understanding Failure Modes in Multi-Agent
  Debate
Authors: Andrea Wynn and Harsh Satija and Gillian Hadfield
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.MA
Comments: ICML MAS Workshop 2025
\\
  While multi-agent debate has been proposed as a promising strategy for
improving AI reasoning ability, we find that debate can sometimes be harmful
rather than helpful. The prior work has exclusively focused on debates within
homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model
capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions.
Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a
decrease in accuracy over time -- even in settings where stronger (i.e., more
capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that
models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer
reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. These results
highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent
debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance
degradation when agents are neither incentivized nor adequately equipped to
resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.

Title: No Translation Needed: Forecasting Quality from Fertility and Metadata
Authors: Jessica M. Lundin, Ada Zhang, David Adelani, Cody Carroll
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  We show that translation quality can be predicted with surprising accuracy
\textit{without ever running the translation system itself}. Using only a
handful of features, token fertility ratios, token counts, and basic linguistic
metadata (language family, script, and region), we can forecast ChrF scores for
GPT-4o translations across 203 languages in the FLORES-200 benchmark. Gradient
boosting models achieve favorable performance ($R^{2}=0.66$ for
XX$\rightarrow$English and $R^{2}=0.72$ for English$\rightarrow$XX). Feature
importance analyses reveal that typological factors dominate predictions into
English, while fertility plays a larger role for translations into diverse
target languages. These findings suggest that translation quality is shaped by
both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology, offering new
insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation.

\\
  As large-language models have been increasingly used as automatic raters for
evaluating free-form content, including document summarization, dialog, and
story generation, work has been dedicated to evaluating such models by
measuring their correlations with human judgment. For \textit{sample-level}
performance, methods which operate by using pairwise comparisons between
machine-generated text perform well but often lack the ability to assign
absolute scores to individual summaries, an ability crucial for use cases that
require thresholding. In this work, we propose a direct-scoring method which
uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time. We
show that our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise
evaluators in terms of axis-averaged sample-level correlations on the SummEval

Title: From Staff Messages to Actionable Insights: A Multi-Stage LLM
  Classification Framework for Healthcare Analytics
Authors: Hajar Sakai, Yi-En Tseng, Mohammadsadegh Mikaeili, Joshua Bosire, and

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Hospital call centers serve as the primary contact point for patients within
a hospital system. They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as
navigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices
following the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This
continuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed
to retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches
require annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient
methodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage
LLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies
messages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple
LLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were
evaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score
and 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and
76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures
and HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The
processed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool
that transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to
healthcare professionals. This approach enables more efficient utilization of
the collected staff messaging data, identifies navigator training
opportunities, and supports improved patient experience and care quality.

Title: The Token Tax: Systematic Bias in Multilingual Tokenization
Authors: Jessica M. Lundin, Ada Zhang, Nihal Karim, Hamza Louzan, Victor Wei,

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Tokenization inefficiency imposes structural disadvantages on morphologically
complex, low-resource languages, inflating compute resources and depressing
accuracy. We evaluate 10 large language models (LLMs) on AfriMMLU (9,000 MCQA
items; 5 subjects; 16 African languages) and show that fertility (tokens/word)
reliably predicts accuracy. Higher fertility consistently predicts lower
accuracy across all models and subjects. We further find that reasoning models
(DeepSeek, o1) consistently outperform non-reasoning peers across high and low
resource languages in the AfriMMLU dataset, narrowing accuracy gaps observed in
prior generations. Finally, translating token inflation to economics, a
doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time, underscoring
the token tax faced by many languages. These results motivate morphologically
aware tokenization, fair pricing, and multilingual benchmarks for equitable
natural language processing (NLP).

  This work presents a Biomedical Literature Question Answering (Q&A) system
based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, designed to
improve access to accurate, evidence-based medical information. Addressing the
shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access
to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed
articles, curated Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant
information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval
pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while
answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model
optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports
both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused
evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of
domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1),
show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance
compared to baseline models. The findings underscore the potential of
RAG-enhanced language models to bridge the gap between complex biomedical
literature and accessible public health knowledge, paving the way for future
work on multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized
medical AI systems.

  This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language
models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors
propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both
directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test
for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally
allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like
userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index
without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and
discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned
on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability
to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,
they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three
types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative
examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.
This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level
pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally
without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT
successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse
performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude
that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for
assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for
developing more capable AI systems.

Title: Ad hoc conventions generalize to new referents
Authors: Anya Ji, Claire Augusta Bergey, Ron Eliav, Yoav Artzi, Robert D.

Categories: cs.CL cs.CY
\\
  How do people talk about things they've never talked about before? One view
suggests that a new shared naming system establishes an arbitrary link to a
specific target, like proper names that cannot extend beyond their bearers. An
alternative view proposes that forming a shared way of describing objects
involves broader conceptual alignment, reshaping each individual's semantic
space in ways that should generalize to new referents. We test these competing
accounts in a dyadic communication study (N=302) leveraging the
recently-released KiloGram dataset containing over 1,000 abstract tangram
images. After pairs of participants coordinated on referential conventions for
one set of images through repeated communication, we measured the extent to
which their descriptions aligned for undiscussed images. We found strong
evidence for generalization: partners showed increased alignment relative to
their pre-test labels. Generalization also decayed nonlinearly with visual
similarity (consistent with Shepard's law) and was robust across levels of the
images' nameability. These findings suggest that ad hoc conventions are not
arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, with implications
for theories of reference and the design of more adaptive language agents.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to
deploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated
by LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy
rationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no
additional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to
capture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the
quality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness
Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of
the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization.
Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the
student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them
when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning
and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a
Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of
each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the
answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the
rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have
shown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to
align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing
such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected
instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while
the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging
inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored
preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first
extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences
and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on
their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is
applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of
response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency.
Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on
AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by
up to 48.1%.

  The paradigm shift from traditional ranked-based search to Generative Search
Engines has rendered conventional SEO metrics obsolete, creating an urgent need
to understand, measure, and optimize for content influence on synthesized
answers. This paper introduces a comprehensive, end-to-end framework for
Generative Search Engine Optimization (GSEO) to address this challenge. We make
two primary contributions. First, we construct CC-GSEO-Bench, a large-scale,
content-centric benchmark, and propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework
that systematically quantifies influence, moving beyond surface-level
attribution to assess substantive semantic impact. Second, we design a novel
multi-agent system that operationalizes this framework, automating the
strategic refinement of content through a collaborative analyze-revise-evaluate
workflow. Our empirical analysis using this framework reveals novel insights
into the dynamics of content influence, offering actionable strategies for
creators and establishing a principled foundation for future GSEO research.

Title: New Insights into Optimal Alignment of Acoustic and Linguistic
  Representations for Knowledge Transfer in ASR
Authors: Xugang Lu, Peng Shen, Yu Tsao, Hisashi Kawai
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is a central challenge to
bridge the pre-trained models in knowledge transfer for automatic speech
recognition (ASR). This alignment is inherently structured and asymmetric:
while multiple consecutive acoustic frames typically correspond to a single
linguistic token (many-to-one), certain acoustic transition regions may relate
to multiple adjacent tokens (one-to-many). Moreover, acoustic sequences often
include frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or
silence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new
insight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal
is to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall
ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant
or noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on
this new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment
model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural
asymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic
modalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at
least one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic
mappings from acoustic to linguistic units. We evaluate our proposed model with
experiments on an CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model for
knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in flexibly controlling degree of matching and hence to improve ASR
performance.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
\\
  The emotional content of song lyrics plays a pivotal role in shaping listener
experiences and influencing musical preferences. This paper investigates the
task of multi-label emotional attribution of song lyrics by predicting six
emotional intensity scores corresponding to six fundamental emotions. A
manually labeled dataset is constructed using a mean opinion score (MOS)
approach, which aggregates annotations from multiple human raters to ensure
reliable ground-truth labels. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of several publicly available large language models
(LLMs) under zero-shot scenarios. Additionally, we fine-tune a BERT-based model
specifically for predicting multi-label emotion scores. Experimental results
reveal the relative strengths and limitations of zero-shot and fine-tuned
models in capturing the nuanced emotional content of lyrics. Our findings
highlight the potential of LLMs for emotion recognition in creative texts,
providing insights into model selection strategies for emotion-based music
information retrieval applications. The labeled dataset is available at

Title: Few-Shot Query Intent Detection via Relation-Aware Prompt Learning
Authors: Liang Zhang, Yuan Li, Shijie Zhang, Zheng Zhang, and Xitong Li
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
\\
  Intent detection is a crucial component of modern conversational systems,
since accurately identifying user intent at the beginning of a conversation is
essential for generating effective responses. Recent efforts have focused on
studying this problem under a challenging few-shot scenario. These approaches
primarily leverage large-scale unlabeled dialogue text corpora to pretrain
language models through various pretext tasks, followed by fine-tuning for
intent detection with very limited annotations. Despite the improvements
achieved, existing methods have predominantly focused on textual data,
neglecting to effectively capture the crucial structural information inherent
in conversational systems, such as the query-query relation and query-answer
relation. To address this gap, we propose SAID, a novel framework that
integrates both textual and relational structure information in a unified
manner for model pretraining for the first time. Building on this framework, we
further propose a novel mechanism, the query-adaptive attention network
(QueryAdapt), which operates at the relation token level by generating
intent-specific relation tokens from well-learned query-query and query-answer
relations explicitly, enabling more fine-grained knowledge transfer. Extensive
experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for
solving complex optimization problems, including Neural Architecture Search
(NAS). However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt
engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and
scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel
framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization
without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our
approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural
architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We
also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select
high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning
samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our
curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs,
encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain
(e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA
configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search. The
datasets and models will be released at https://github.com/Ashone3/LM-Searcher.

Title: Cross-Question Method Reuse in Large Language Models: From Word-Level
  Prediction to Rational Logical-Layer Reasoning
Authors: Hong Su
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist in finding
solutions for diverse questions. Prior work has proposed representing a method
as a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.
However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly
similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address
questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not
explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific
sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the
question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The
LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing
it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,
we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or
hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond
conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our
scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable
solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.

to 10B parameters, Llama-GENBA-10B is continuously pretrained on 164B tokens

preventing English dominance. Targeted at the German NLP community, the model
also promotes Bavarian as a low-resource language. Development tackled four
challenges: (1) curating a multilingual corpus despite Bavarian scarcity, (2)
creating a unified tokenizer for English, German, and Bavarian, (3) optimizing
architecture and language-ratio hyperparameters for cross-lingual transfer, and
(4) establishing the first standardized trilingual evaluation suite by
translating German benchmarks into Bavarian. Evaluations show that
Llama-GENBA-10B achieves strong cross-lingual performance, with the fine-tuned
variant surpassing Apertus-8B-2509 and gemma-2-9b in Bavarian and establishing
itself as the best model in its class for this language, while also
outperforming EuroLLM in English and matching its results in German. Training

Title: Revealing the Numeracy Gap: An Empirical Investigation of Text Embedding
  Models
Authors: Ningyuan Deng, Hanyu Duan, Yixuan Tang, Yi Yang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Text embedding models are widely used in natural language processing
applications. However, their capability is often benchmarked on tasks that do
not require understanding nuanced numerical information in text. As a result,
it remains unclear whether current embedding models can precisely encode
numerical content, such as numbers, into embeddings. This question is critical
because embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers
matter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share
grew by 2\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market
share grew by 20\%, even though both indicate growth in market share. This
study aims to examine whether text embedding models can capture such nuances.
Using synthetic data in a financial context, we evaluate 13 widely used text
embedding models and find that they generally struggle to capture numerical
details accurately. Our further analyses provide deeper insights into embedding
numeracy, informing future research to strengthen embedding model-based NLP
systems with improved capacity for handling numerical content.

existing datasets often lack essential demographic factors, such as age and

  Language Processing

  Jean Louis E. K. Fendji, and Christopher Gies
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
encoding and understanding the complexity of natural languages through the
power of quantum computation. This paper presents a pretrained quantum
context-sensitive embedding model, called QCSE, that captures context-sensitive
word embeddings, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems to learn
contextual relationships in languages. The model introduces quantum-native
context learning, enabling the utilization of quantum computers for linguistic
tasks. Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix
computation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based
on their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and
tested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as
exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based
transformations. These methods ensure that the quantum embeddings retain
context sensitivity, thereby making them suitable for downstream language tasks
where the expressibility and properties of quantum systems are valuable
resources. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the associated
context matrix methods, evaluations are conducted on both a Fulani corpus, a
low-resource African language, dataset of small size and an English corpus of
slightly larger size. The results demonstrate that QCSE not only captures
context sensitivity but also leverages the expressibility of quantum systems
for representing rich, context-aware language information. The use of Fulani
further highlights the potential of QNLP to mitigate the problem of lack of
data for this category of languages. This work underscores the power of quantum
computation in natural language processing (NLP) and opens new avenues for
applying QNLP to real-world linguistic challenges across various tasks and
domains.

Title: LatinX: Aligning a Multilingual TTS Model with Direct Preference
  Optimization
Authors: Luis Felipe Chary, Miguel Arjona Ramirez
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  We present LatinX, a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) model for cascaded
speech-to-speech translation that preserves the source speaker's identity
across languages. LatinX is a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in
three stages: (i) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (ii) supervised
fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (iii) alignment with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on Word
Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity metrics. Trained on English and Romance
languages with emphasis on Portuguese, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER

Title: ZhiFangDanTai: Fine-tuning Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation
  Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula
Authors: ZiXuan Zhang, Bowen Hao, Yingjie Li, Hongzhi Yin
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas play a significant role in
treating epidemics and complex diseases. Existing models for TCM utilize
traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula
relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula
compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM
instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable
formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the
roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy;
contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis-limiting the depth of model
outputs. To address these challenges, we propose ZhiFangDanTai, a framework
combining Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with LLM
fine-tuning. ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured
TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced
instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved
information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating
that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization
error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental results on
both collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFangDanTai achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our model is
open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/tczzx6/ZhiFangDanTai1.0.

  Evaluating factual accuracy in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated clinical
text is a critical barrier to adoption, as expert review is unscalable for the
continuous quality assurance these systems require. We address this challenge
with two complementary contributions. First, we introduce MedFactEval, a
framework for scalable, fact-grounded evaluation where clinicians define
high-salience key facts and an "LLM Jury"--a multi-LLM majority vote--assesses
their inclusion in generated summaries. Second, we present MedAgentBrief, a
model-agnostic, multi-step workflow designed to generate high-quality, factual
discharge summaries. To validate our evaluation framework, we established a
gold-standard reference using a seven-physician majority vote on
clinician-defined key facts from inpatient cases. The MedFactEval LLM Jury
achieved almost perfect agreement with this panel (Cohen's kappa=81%), a
performance statistically non-inferior to that of a single human expert
(kappa=67%, P < 0.001). Our work provides both a robust evaluation framework
(MedFactEval) and a high-performing generation workflow (MedAgentBrief),
offering a comprehensive approach to advance the responsible deployment of
generative AI in clinical workflows.

Title: Let's Roleplay: Examining LLM Alignment in Collaborative Dialogues
Authors: Abhijnan Nath, Carine Graff and Nikhil Krishnaswamy
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into diverse workflows, they are
increasingly being considered "collaborators" with humans. If such AI
collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions
must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment
techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do
not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This
paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness
as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question
through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to
encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning
for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate
interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task
conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that
quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group
collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware
approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both
convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and
correctness of task outcomes.

Title: Enhancing the Robustness of Contextual ASR to Varying Biasing
  Information Volumes Through Purified Semantic Correlation Joint Modeling
Authors: Yue Gu, Zhihao Du, Ying Shi, Shiliang Zhang, Qian Chen, and Jiqing Han
Categories: cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS

  10.1109/TASLPRO.2025.3606198
\\
  Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR)
models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing
phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by
variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the
biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of
the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant
to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and
integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire
biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information
volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic
correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and
calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate
representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,
phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled
to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information
across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual
recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the
joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification
mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant
biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves
average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46%
on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths.

Title: Accelerating Large Language Model Inference via Early-Exiting Algorithms
Authors: Sangmin Bae
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: PhD Dissertation
\\
  Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their
practical deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. While
adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs,
they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save
computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically
reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this
conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike
an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first
addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by
proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep
parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields
compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical
synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents
a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically
assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a
new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively
optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a
single model.

\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various
tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliable adoption.
Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA have been developed to measure truthfulness, yet
they are primarily available in English, leaving a gap in evaluating LLMs in
low-resource languages. To address this, we present KatotohananQA, a Filipino
translation of the TruthfulQA benchmark. Seven free-tier proprietary models
were assessed using a binary-choice framework. Findings show a significant
performance gap between English and Filipino truthfulness, with newer OpenAI
models (GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini) demonstrating strong multilingual robustness.
Results also reveal disparities across question characteristics, suggesting
that some question types, categories, and topics are less robust to
multilingual transfer which highlight the need for broader multilingual
evaluation to ensure fairness and reliability in LLM usage.

Title: Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph Modeling for
  Conversational Speech Synthesis
Authors: Zhenqi Jia, Rui Liu, Berrak Sisman, Haizhou Li
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted by EMNLP 2025
\\
  Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to generate speech with natural
prosody by understanding the multimodal dialogue history (MDH). The latest work
predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling
the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target
utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at
the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and
prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a
novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our
approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue
interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction
graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between
word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in
MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized
speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk
dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of
prosodic expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at
https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/MFCIG-CSS.

Title: Orthogonal Low-rank Adaptation in Lie Groups for Continual Learning of
  Large Language Models
Authors: Kefan Cao, Shuaicheng Wu
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 13 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) are prone to catastrophic forgetting in
sequential multi-task settings. Parameter regularization methods such as O-LoRA
and N-LoRA alleviate task interference by enforcing low-rank subspace
orthogonality, but they overlook the fact that conventional additive
fine-tuning disrupts the intrinsic geometric structure of LLM parameters,
limiting performance. Our key insight is that the parameter space of LLMs
possesses a geometric structure, which must be preserved in addition to
enforcing orthogonality. Based on this, we propose Orthogonal Low-rank
Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA), which introduces Lie group theory into LLM
fine-tuning: leveraging multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry
while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces. Experiments
demonstrate that OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL
benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of
Tasks setting.

  We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament
debate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic
metadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age,
country, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing
consistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female
MEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female
speakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming
on both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform
open-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release
the EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness
and accountability in NLP within political contexts.

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: ACL Findings 2025
\\
  Recent progress in developing general purpose text embedders has been driven
by training on ever-growing corpora of synthetic LLM-generated data.
Nonetheless, no publicly available synthetic dataset exists, posing a barrier
to studying its role for generalization. To address this issue, we first
reproduce and publicly release the synthetic data proposed by Wang et al.
(Mistral-E5). Our synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent
improvements in performance. Next, we critically examine where exactly
synthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that
benefits from synthetic data are sparse and highly localized to individual
datasets. Moreover, we observe trade-offs between the performance on different
categories and data that benefits one task, degrades performance on another.
Our findings highlight the limitations of current synthetic data approaches for
building general-purpose embedders and challenge the notion that training on
synthetic data leads to more robust embedding models across tasks.

  This paper presents a novel approach to recruitment automation. Large
Language Models (LLMs) were fine-tuned to improve accuracy and efficiency.
Building upon our previous work on the Multilayer Large Language Model-Based
Robotic Process Automation Applicant Tracking (MLAR) system . This work
introduces a novel methodology. Training fine-tuned LLMs specifically tuned for
recruitment tasks. The proposed framework addresses the limitations of generic
LLMs by creating a synthetic dataset that uses a standardized JSON format. This
helps ensure consistency and scalability. In addition to the synthetic data
set, the resumes were parsed using DeepSeek, a high-parameter LLM. The resumes
were parsed into the same structured JSON format and placed in the training
set. This will help improve data diversity and realism. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance
metrics, such as exact match, F1 score, BLEU score, ROUGE score, and overall
similarity compared to base models and other state-of-the-art LLMs. In
particular, the fine-tuned Phi-4 model achieved the highest F1 score of 90.62%,
indicating exceptional precision and recall in recruitment tasks. This study
highlights the potential of fine-tuned LLMs. Furthermore, it will revolutionize
recruitment workflows by providing more accurate candidate-job matching.

  This paper presents MSLEF, a multi-segment ensemble framework that employs
LLM fine-tuning to enhance resume parsing in recruitment automation. It
integrates fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) using weighted voting, with
each model specializing in a specific resume segment to boost accuracy.
Building on MLAR , MSLEF introduces a segment-aware architecture that leverages
field-specific weighting tailored to each resume part, effectively overcoming
the limitations of single-model systems by adapting to diverse formats and
structures. The framework incorporates Gemini-2.5-Flash LLM as a high-level
aggregator for complex sections and utilizes Gemma 9B, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and Phi-4
14B. MSLEF achieves significant improvements in Exact Match (EM), F1 score,
BLEU, ROUGE, and Recruitment Similarity (RS) metrics, outperforming the best
single model by up to +7% in RS. Its segment-aware design enhances
generalization across varied resume layouts, making it highly adaptable to
real-world hiring scenarios while ensuring precise and reliable candidate

Title: Mask-GCG: Are All Tokens in Adversarial Suffixes Necessary for Jailbreak
  Attacks?

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.CR
\\
  Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various
successful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful
responses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate
Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes
the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several
improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length
suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains
unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that
employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix.
Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact
positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only
reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby
lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve
successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the
original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most
tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a
minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the
attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts.
Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs
from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.

Title: PL-CA: A Parametric Legal Case Augmentation Framework
Authors: Ao Chang, Yubo Chen, Jun Zhao
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Conventional RAG is considered one of the most effective methods for
addressing model knowledge insufficiency and hallucination, particularly in the
judicial domain that requires high levels of knowledge rigor, logical
consistency, and content integrity. However, the conventional RAG method only
injects retrieved documents directly into the model's context, which severely
constrains models due to their limited context windows and introduces
additional computational overhead through excessively long contexts, thereby
disrupting models' attention and degrading performance on downstream tasks.
Moreover, many existing benchmarks lack expert annotation and focus solely on
individual downstream tasks while real-world legal scenarios consist of
multiple mixed legal tasks, indicating conventional benchmarks' inadequacy for
reflecting models' true capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose
PL-CA, which introduces a parametric RAG (P-RAG) framework to perform data
augmentation on corpus knowledge and encode this legal knowledge into
parametric vectors, and then integrates this parametric knowledge into the
LLM's feed-forward networks (FFN) via LoRA, thereby alleviating models' context
pressure. Additionally, we also construct a multi-task legal dataset comprising
more than 2000 training and test instances, which are all expert-annotated and
manually verified. We conduct our experiments on our dataset, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the overhead
associated with excessively long contexts while maintaining competitive
performance on downstream tasks compared to conventional RAG. Our code and
dataset are provided in the appendix.

  This paper explores the multilingual commonsense generation abilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate this investigation, we introduce
MULTICOM, a novel benchmark that extends the COCOTEROS dataset to four
languages: English, Spanish, Dutch, and Valencian. The task involves generating
a commonsensical sentence that includes a given triplet of words. We evaluate a
range of open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Qwen, Gemma, EuroLLM, and
Salamandra, on this benchmark. Our evaluation combines automatic metrics,
LLM-as-a-judge approaches (using Prometheus and JudgeLM), and human
annotations. Results consistently show superior performance in English, with
significantly lower performance in less-resourced languages. While contextual
support yields mixed results, it tends to benefit underrepresented languages.
These findings underscore the current limitations of LLMs in multilingual

  The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward
agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for
retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing
open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities
on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify
that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information
seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic
data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative,
long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer
pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By
leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced
web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100
tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse
information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art
performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able
to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving
higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best
performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES.
Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong
generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on
knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a
practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

Authors: Andrei Baroian and Kasper Notebomer
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: The reported results are skewed due to a data type mismatch. The
  dataset was saved with int32, but the data loader interpreted it as uint16.
  As a result, each 32-bit token was incorrectly split into two 16-bit tokens.
  Outcome: a consistent artifact where every other token is zero
\\
  Transformer-based language models traditionally use uniform (isotropic) layer
sizes, yet they ignore the diverse functional roles that different depths can
play and their computational capacity needs. Building on Layer-Wise Scaling
(LWS) and pruning literature, we introduce three new LWS variants - Framed,
Reverse, and Crown - that redistribute FFN widths and attention heads via two
or three-point linear interpolation in the pre-training stage. We present the
first systematic ablation of LWS and its variants, on a fixed budget of 180M
parameters, trained on 5B tokens. All models converge to similar losses and
achieve better performance compared to an equal-cost isotropic baseline,
without a substantial decrease in training throughput. This work represents an
initial step into the design space of layer-wise architectures for
pre-training, but future work should scale experiments to orders of magnitude
more tokens and parameters to fully assess their potential.

Authors: Jian Wu, Hang Yu, Bingchang Liu, Wenjie Yang, Peng Di, Jianguo Li, Yue

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains often faces a
critical bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality, human-curated data. While
large volumes of unchecked data are readily available, indiscriminately using
them for fine-tuning risks introducing noise and degrading performance.
Strategic data selection is thus crucial, requiring a method that is both
accurate and efficient. Existing approaches, categorized as similarity-based
and direct optimization methods, struggle to simultaneously achieve these
goals. In this paper, we introduce LAMDAS (LLM As an iMplicit classifier for
domain-specific DAta Selection), a novel approach that leverages the
pre-trained LLM itself as an implicit classifier, thereby bypassing explicit
feature engineering and computationally intensive optimization process. LAMDAS
reframes data selection as a one-class classification problem, identifying
candidate data that "belongs" to the target domain defined by a small reference
dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LAMDAS not only
exceeds the performance of full-data training using a fraction of the data but
also outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under various
scenarios. Furthermore, LAMDAS achieves the most compelling balance between
performance gains and computational efficiency compared to all evaluated
baselines.

Title: SLiNT: Structure-aware Language Model with Injection and Contrastive
  Training for Knowledge Graph Completion

\\
  Link prediction in knowledge graphs requires integrating structural
information and semantic context to infer missing entities. While large
language models offer strong generative reasoning capabilities, their limited
exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and
semantic ambiguity, especially under incomplete or zero-shot settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SLiNT (Structure-aware Language model with
Injection and coNtrastive Training), a modular framework that injects
knowledge-graph-derived structural context into a frozen LLM backbone with
lightweight LoRA-based adaptation for robust link prediction. Specifically,
Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) retrieves pseudo-neighbors to
enrich sparse entities and mitigate missing context; Dynamic Hard Contrastive
Learning (DHCL) introduces fine-grained supervision by interpolating hard
positives and negatives to resolve entity-level ambiguity; and
Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) performs token-level structure-aware
intervention while preserving the core LLM parameters. Experiments on WN18RR
and FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance
compared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines,
demonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for
scalable knowledge graph completion.

Title: HAVE: Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration for Hallucination
  Mitigation in Large Language Models
Authors: Xin Tong, Zhi Lin, Jingya Wang, Bo Jin
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations in
retrieval-augmented or long-context generation, even when relevant evidence is
present. This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as
input-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true
contribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a
parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE
introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing
of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the
magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together,
these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and
fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled
policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass,
making it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA
benchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces
hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest
overhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates
with off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world
settings.

  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications has
driven the need for structured and reliable responses. A key challenge in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is ensuring that outputs align
with expected formats while minimizing hallucinations. This study examines the
role of guided decoding in RAG systems, comparing three methods, Outlines,
XGrammar, and LM Format Enforcer, across different multi-turn prompting setups
(0-turn, 1-turn, and 2-turn). By evaluating success rates, hallucination rates,
and output quality, we provide insights into their performance and
applicability. Our findings reveal how multi-turn interactions influence guided
decoding, uncovering unexpected performance variations that can inform method
selection for specific use cases. This work advances the understanding of
structured output generation in RAG systems, offering both theoretical insights
and practical guidance for LLM deployment.

Title: Modelling Intertextuality with N-gram Embeddings
Authors: Yi Xing
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Intertextuality is a central tenet in literary studies. It refers to the
intricate links between literary texts that are created by various types of
references. This paper proposes a new quantitative model of intertextuality to
enable scalable analysis and network-based insights: perform pairwise
comparisons of the embeddings of n-grams from two texts and average their
results as the overall intertextuality. Validation on four texts with known
degrees of intertextuality, alongside a scalability test on 267 diverse texts,
demonstrates the method's effectiveness and efficiency. Network analysis
further reveals centrality and community structures, affirming the approach's
success in capturing and quantifying intertextual relationships.

Title: Domain-Aware RAG: MoL-Enhanced RL for Efficient Training and Scalable
  Retrieval
Authors: Hao Lin and Peitong Xie and Jingxue Chen and Jie Lin and Qingkun Tang
  and Qianchun Lu
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
\\
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on the retrieval
stage, particularly the coarse-ranking process. Existing coarse-ranking
optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge
learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance.
To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that
uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a
two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of
Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language
capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for
maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage
Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL
training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage
Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline
methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and
scalable retrieval in specialized domains.

Comments: EMNLP 2025 Findings camera-ready, 9+7 pages
\\
  Engagement and motivation are crucial for second-language acquisition, yet
maintaining learner interest in educational conversations remains a challenge.
While prior research has explored what makes educational texts interesting,
still little is known about the linguistic features that drive engagement in
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large
dataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in
teacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus
(TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations,
allowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how
interest evolves over extended dialogues. We employ a rigorous annotation
process with over 100 second-language learners, using a comparison-based rating
approach inspired by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
improve agreement. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can
predict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters)
fine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like
GPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model
engagement in educational settings. Finally, we analyze how linguistic and
cognitive factors, such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and
uptake, influence engagement in educational dialogues.

WhisperX and Wav2Vec 2.0 to extract automated audio-text alignment. Our
processing pipeline improves upon the ParCzech 3.0 speech recognition version
by extracting more data with higher alignment reliability. The dataset is
offered in three flexible variants: (1) sentence-segmented for automatic speech
recognition and speech synthesis tasks with clean boundaries, (2) unsegmented
preserving original utterance flow across sentences, and (3) a raw-alignment
for further custom refinement for other possible tasks. All variants maintain
the original metadata and are released under a permissive CC-BY license. The
dataset is available in the LINDAT repository, with the sentence-segmented and
unsegmented variants additionally available on Hugging Face.

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2025

  Aggregating multiple annotations into a single ground truth label may hide
valuable insights into annotator disagreement, particularly in tasks where
subjectivity plays a crucial role. In this work, we explore methods for
identifying subjectivity in recognizing the human values that motivate
arguments. We evaluate two main approaches: inferring subjectivity through
value prediction vs. directly identifying subjectivity. Our experiments show
that direct subjectivity identification significantly improves the model
performance of flagging subjective arguments. Furthermore, combining
contrastive loss with binary cross-entropy loss does not improve performance
but reduces the dependency on per-label subjectivity. Our proposed methods can
help identify arguments that individuals may interpret differently, fostering a
more nuanced annotation process.

Title: Anchoring Refusal Direction: Mitigating Safety Risks in Tuning via
  Projection Constraint
Authors: Yanrui Du, Fenglei Fan, Sendong Zhao, Jiawei Cao, Qika Lin, Kai He,
  Ting Liu, Bing Qin, Mengling Feng
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective
post-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise
LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,
raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of
LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,
which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this
insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,
which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To
mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a
projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of
each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis
shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the
refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by
overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our
observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we
introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and
broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an
enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,
and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks
posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong
baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.
Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the
r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration
of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety
research.

Title: MachineLearningLM: Continued Pretraining Language Models on Millions of
  Synthetic Tabular Prediction Tasks Scales In-Context ML
Authors: Haoyu Dong, Pengkun Zhang, Mingzhe Lu, Yanzhen Shen, Guolin Ke
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong
general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many
in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to
leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without
gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable
continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust
in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning
for broader chat workflows.
  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural
causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a
random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM
to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a
token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and
delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.
  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8),
MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an
average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across
finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking
many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context
demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it
attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat
capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves
75.4% on MMLU.

Title: MoGU V2: Toward a Higher Pareto Frontier Between Model Usability and
  Security
Authors: Yanrui Du, Fenglei Fan, Sendong Zhao, Jiawei Cao, Ting Liu, Bing Qin
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their
security has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to
maintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive
methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,
rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents
a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and
security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we
propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically
allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions
of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial
potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy
and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved
MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and
hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly
classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during
router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong
adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including
mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs
optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for
user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction
Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task
performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive
improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for
mitigating security risks in real-world applications.

Title: Saturation-Driven Dataset Generation for LLM Mathematical Reasoning in
  the TPTP Ecosystem
Authors: Valentin Quesnel and Damien Sileo
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck
for advancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
work confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving
research into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs
or complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework
leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to
derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is
principled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for "interesting" theorems, and
generate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by
construction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three
difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,
and proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a
clear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural
reasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap
and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it. We make the code
and data publicly available.

\\
  Effective Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is critical to reducing the
Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) from wind power, yet the unstructured,
free-text nature of turbine maintenance logs presents a significant barrier to
automated analysis. Our paper addresses this by presenting a novel and
reproducible framework for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on the
task of classifying these complex industrial records. To promote transparency
and encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available
as an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational
assessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and
model calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy,
identifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard
and trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that
classification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic
ambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component
identification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model
achieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude
that the most effective and responsible near-term application is a
Human-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate
and standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data
quality and downstream reliability analysis.

Title: COMPACT: Common-token Optimized Model Pruning Across Channels and Tokens
Authors: Eugene Kwek and Wenpeng Yin
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Making LLMs more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial
for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at
scale. Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning
methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout
or requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers
and can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which
jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)
prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,
aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys
merits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps
a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN
pruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong
memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and
Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at
similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters,
GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.

\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets using advanced
deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of language tasks, becoming a cornerstone of modern AI technologies.
However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as
reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for
upholding ethical, cultural, and social values. Careful alignment of training
data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing
responsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of
Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically
designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects:
truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We
curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading
models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and
Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal
significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need
for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior. Furthermore,
our findings offer valuable insights into the alignment of these models with
Persian ethical-cultural values and highlight critical gaps and opportunities
for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI. The dataset is

Title: The Majority is not always right: RL training for solution aggregation
Authors: Wenting Zhao, Pranjal Aggarwal, Swarnadeep Saha, Asli Celikyilmaz,
  Jason Weston, Ilia Kulikov
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Scaling up test-time compute, by generating multiple independent solutions
and selecting or aggregating among them, has become a central paradigm for
improving large language models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. While
most prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to
aggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this
work, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a
set of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile,
and synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard
training examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover
minority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers.
Empirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and
reward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes
effectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than
contained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens
than majority voting with larger numbers of solutions.

\\
  Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard
machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there
has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect
to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model
pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build
mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio
schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700
low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing
that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the
relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these
low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar
classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5
Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous
generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and
low-resource languages.

Authors: Aivin V. Solatorio
Categories: cs.CL cs.CR cs.DB cs.LG
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that
deviate from available data, a failure known as \emph{numeric hallucination}.
Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and
uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity:
fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose
\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that
enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric
spans are emitted as \emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a
verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,
rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places
verification in the \emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers
are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation
prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and
prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and
monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,
integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with
cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before
display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:
\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates
uncertainty.

Title: Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning
Authors: Liang Chen, Xueting Han, Li Shen, Jing Bai, Kam-Fai Wong
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe
efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common
practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this
decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby
constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for
learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate
better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT
objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how
to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs
RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level
explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint
SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and
achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

Title: Revolutionizing Reinforcement Learning Framework for Diffusion Large
  Language Models
Authors: Yinjie Wang, Ling Yang, Bowen Li, Ye Tian, Ke Shen, Mengdi Wang
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Code and Models: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/dLLM-RL
\\
  We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for
diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference
trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different
architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances
training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex
math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific
models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing
TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models,
namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still
consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks.
TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first
long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1%
relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical
applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building,
training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The
framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for
both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of
various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and
general tasks. Code and Models: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/dLLM-RL

Title: On the Same Wavelength? Evaluating Pragmatic Reasoning in Language
  Models across Broad Concepts

Comments: EMNLP 2025 (Main)
\\
  Language use is shaped by pragmatics -- i.e., reasoning about communicative
goals and norms in context. As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as
conversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their
pragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from
Wavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener
communicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a
range of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using
direct and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational
Speech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM
inference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve
strong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human
accuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT
prompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting,
and using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study
helps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning
abilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening
up future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language
understanding, and social reasoning in LMs and humans.

Title: Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural
  Networks
Authors: Sachin Chhabra, Hemanth Venkateswara and Baoxin Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Published in British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2024
Journal-ref: Proc. British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2024
\\
  Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

Title: VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling Tool for Object Detection
Authors: Isac Holm
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG
Comments: Master's project
\\
  The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

Title: Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image
  Classification
Authors: Zhengda Li
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

  Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

  In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

Title: RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World
  Object Recognition Robustness
Authors: Junghyun Park, Tuan Anh Nguyen, Dugki Min
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

  Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

Title: A Stroke-Level Large-Scale Database of Chinese Character Handwriting and
  the OpenHandWrite_Toolbox for Handwriting Research
Authors: Zebo Xu, Shaoyun Yu, Mark Torrance, Guido Nottbusch, Nan Zhao, and
  Zhenguang Cai
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

\\
  Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

  Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Title: Delta Velocity Rectified Flow for Text-to-Image Editing
Authors: Gaspard Beaudouin, Minghan Li, Jaeyeon Kim, Sunghoon Yoon, Mengyu Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

Title: Systematic Integration of Attention Modules into CNNs for Accurate and
  Generalizable Medical Image Diagnosis
Authors: Zahid Ullah, Minki Hong, Tahir Mahmood, Jihie Kim
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

performance of each model is assessed and compared based on mean Average

These findings provide valuable guidance for selecting appropriate detection

Title: Unsupervised Instance Segmentation with Superpixels
Authors: Cuong Manh Hoang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Journal-ref: Pattern Recognition, 2025
\\
  Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the
same observed features.

Title: Advanced Brain Tumor Segmentation Using EMCAD: Efficient Multi-scale
  Convolutional Attention Decoding
Authors: GodsGift Uzor, Tania-Amanda Nkoyo Fredrick Eneye, Chukwuebuka Ijezue
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Brain tumor segmentation is a critical pre-processing step in the medical
image analysis pipeline that involves precise delineation of tumor regions from
healthy brain tissue in medical imaging data, particularly MRI scans. An
efficient and effective decoding mechanism is crucial in brain tumor
segmentation especially in scenarios with limited computational resources.
However these decoding mechanisms usually come with high computational costs.
To address this concern EMCAD a new efficient multi-scale convolutional
attention decoder designed was utilized to optimize both performance and
computational efficiency for brain tumor segmentation on the BraTs2020 dataset
consisting of MRI scans from 369 brain tumor patients. The preliminary result
obtained by the model achieved a best Dice score of 0.31 and maintained a
stable mean Dice score of 0.285 plus/minus 0.015 throughout the training
process which is moderate. The initial model maintained consistent performance
across the validation set without showing signs of over-fitting.

Title: FAVAE-Effective Frequency Aware Latent Tokenizer
Authors: Tejaswini Medi, Hsien-Yi Wang, Arianna Rampini, Margret Keuper
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

\\
  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

\\
  The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Title: Quaternion Approximation Networks for Enhanced Image Classification and
  Oriented Object Detection
Authors: Bryce Grant, Peng Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
Comments: Accepted to IROS 2025
\\
  This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Title: Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation
  in 3D Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Sen Wang, Kunyi Li, Siyun Liang, Elena Alegret, Jing Ma, Nassir Navab,
  Stefano Gasperini
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

Title: DuoCLR: Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning for Skeleton-based Human
  Action Segmentation
Authors: Haitao Tian and Pierre Payeur
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ICCV 2025 accepted paper
\\
  In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

Title: RED: Robust Event-Guided Motion Deblurring with Modality-Specific
  Disentangled Representation

Categories: cs.CV cs.IR
\\
  Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Title: Sensitivity-Aware Post-Training Quantization for Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Zekang Zheng, Haokun Li, Yaofo Chen, Mingkui Tan, Qing Du
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by PRCV 2025
\\
  Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

  In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

  Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The

\\
  Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

Title: Patch-level Kernel Alignment for Self-Supervised Dense Representation

Authors: Juan Yeo, Ijun Jang, Taesup Kim
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

  Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

Title: SuMa: A Subspace Mapping Approach for Robust and Effective Concept
  Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
Authors: Kien Nguyen, Anh Tran, Cuong Pham
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

  Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

Title: EditIDv2: Editable ID Customization with Data-Lubricated ID Feature
  Integration for Text-to-Image Generation
Authors: Guandong Li, Zhaobin Chu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

Title: OOTSM: A Decoupled Linguistic Framework for Effective Scene Graph
  Anticipation
Authors: Xiaomeng Zhu, Changwei Wang, Haozhe Wang, Xinyu Liu, Fangzhen Lin
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

Title: WIPUNet: A Physics-inspired Network with Weighted Inductive Biases for
  Image Denoising
Authors: Wasikul Islam
Categories: cs.CV hep-ex
Comments: 13 pages, 4 figures
\\
  In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

Title: Context-Aware Multi-Turn Visual-Textual Reasoning in LVLMs via Dynamic
  Memory and Adaptive Visual Guidance
Authors: Weijie Shen, Xinrui Wang, Yuanqi Nie, Apiradee Boonmee
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Title: MeshMetrics: A Precise Implementation of Distance-Based Image
  Segmentation Metrics
Authors: Ga\v{s}per Podobnik and Toma\v{z} Vrtovec
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

Title: Leveraging Vision-Language Large Models for Interpretable Video Action
  Recognition with Semantic Tokenization
Authors: Jingwei Peng, Zhixuan Qiu, Boyu Jin, Surasakdi Siripong
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

Title: JRN-Geo: A Joint Perception Network based on RGB and Normal images for
  Cross-view Geo-localization
Authors: Hongyu Zhou, Yunzhou Zhang, Tingsong Huang, Fawei Ge, Man Qi, Xichen
  Zhang, Yizhong Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Title: LiDAR-BIND-T: Improving SLAM with Temporally Consistent Cross-Modal
  LiDAR Reconstruction
Authors: Niels Balemans, Ali Anwar, Jan Steckel, and Siegfried Mercelis
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO
\\
  This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Title: Multi-LVI-SAM: A Robust LiDAR-Visual-Inertial Odometry for Multiple
  Fisheye Cameras
Authors: Xinyu Zhang, Kai Huang, Junqiao Zhao, Zihan Yuan, Tiantian Feng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

Title: Depth-Aware Super-Resolution via Distance-Adaptive Variational
  Formulation
Authors: Tianhao Guo, Bingjie Lu, Feng Wang and Zhengyang Lu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

  We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made

Title: Unleashing Hierarchical Reasoning: An LLM-Driven Framework for
  Training-Free Referring Video Object Segmentation
Authors: Bingrui Zhao, Lin Yuanbo Wu, Xiangtian Fan, Deyin Liu, Lu Zhang, Ruyi
  He, Jialie Shen, Ximing Li
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

\\
  Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

Title: Posterior shape models revisited: Improving 3D reconstructions from
  partial data using target specific models
Authors: Jonathan Aellen, Florian Burkhardt, Thomas Vetter, Marcel L\"uthi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

\\
  PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

Title: CRAB: Camera-Radar Fusion for Reducing Depth Ambiguity in Backward
  Projection based View Transformation

\\
  Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

Title: Dual-Mode Deep Anomaly Detection for Medical Manufacturing: Structural
  Similarity and Feature Distance
Authors: Julio Zanon Diaz, Georgios Siogkas, Peter Corcoran

Comments: 18 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables
\\
  Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

Title: A Probabilistic Segment Anything Model for Ambiguity-Aware Medical Image
  Segmentation
Authors: Tyler Ward, Abdullah Imran
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Preprint
\\
  Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

  Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

  Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

Title: BTCChat: Advancing Remote Sensing Bi-temporal Change Captioning with
  Multimodal Large Language Model
Authors: Yujie Li, Wenjia Xu, Yuanben Zhang, Zhiwei Wei, Mugen Peng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures Submitted to ICASSP 2026
\\
  Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

\\
  Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

Title: Compression Beyond Pixels: Semantic Compression with Multimodal
  Foundation Models
Authors: Ruiqi Shen, Haotian Wu, Wenjing Zhang, Jiangjing Hu, Deniz Gunduz
Categories: cs.CV cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Published as a conference paper at IEEE 35th Workshop on Machine
  Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)
\\
  Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

Title: AttriPrompt: Dynamic Prompt Composition Learning for CLIP
Authors: Qiqi Zhan, Shiwei Li, Qingjie Liu, Yunhong Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

Title: Coefficients-Preserving Sampling for Reinforcement Learning with Flow
  Matching
Authors: Feng Wang, Zihao Yu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: work in progress
\\
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

  Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

Title: StripDet: Strip Attention-Based Lightweight 3D Object Detection from
  Point Cloud
Authors: Weichao Wang, Wendong Mao and Zhongfeng Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud
remains a significant challenge due to their substantial computational and
memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel
lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the
novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to
capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D
convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions, SAB efficiently extracts
directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to
linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that
integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms
recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical
solution for real-world 3D detection on edge devices.

Title: Neural Bloom: A Deep Learning Approach to Real-Time Lighting
Authors: Rafal Karp, Dawid Gruszka, Tomasz Trzcinski
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

Title: Spatial-Aware Self-Supervision for Medical 3D Imaging with
  Multi-Granularity Observable Tasks
Authors: Yiqin Zhang, Meiling Chen, Zhengjie Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

\\
  OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: Accepted at ICCV 2025
\\
  Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

Title: Multi-Strategy Guided Diffusion via Sparse Masking Temporal Reweighting
  Distribution Correction
Authors: Zekun Zhou, Yanru Gong, Liu Shi, Qiegen Liu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Authors: Diana-Alexandra Sas, Florin Oniga
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 6 pages. Accepted to MMSP 2025
\\
  Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

\\
  Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Title: Khana: A Comprehensive Indian Cuisine Dataset
Authors: Omkar Prabhu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark
for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers
creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian
cuisine. Webpage: https://khana.omkar.xyz

Title: BLaVe-CoT: Consistency-Aware Visual Question Answering for Blind and Low
  Vision Users
Authors: Wanyin Cheng and Zanxi Ruan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Title: Cross-Modal Enhancement and Benchmark for UAV-based Open-Vocabulary
  Object Detection
Authors: Zhenhai Weng, Zhongliang Yu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

Title: Micro-Expression Recognition via Fine-Grained Dynamic Perception
Authors: Zhiwen Shao, Yifan Cheng, Fan Zhang, Xuehuai Shi, Canlin Li, Lizhuang
  Ma and Dit-yan Yeung
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

\\
  Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time
deployment.

\\
  The reliable analysis of blood reports is important for health knowledge, but
individuals often struggle with interpretation, leading to anxiety and
overlooked issues. We explore the potential of general-purpose Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to address this challenge by automatically analyzing blood report
images. We conduct a comparative evaluation of three VLMs: Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini
2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, determining their performance on a dataset of
100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically
relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then
processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models
responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood
report analysis. Their ability to provide clear interpretations directly from
images can improve health literacy and reduce the limitations to understanding
complex medical information. This work establishes a foundation for the future
development of reliable and accessible AI-assisted healthcare applications.
While results are encouraging, they should be interpreted cautiously given the
limited dataset size.

Title: TinyDef-DETR:An Enhanced DETR Detector for UAV Power Line Defect
  Detection
Authors: Jiaming Cui
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CE
\\
  Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

\\
  Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Title: Multi-Stage Graph Neural Networks for Data-Driven Prediction of Natural
  Convection in Enclosed Cavities
Authors: Mohammad Ahangarkiasari and Hassan Pouraria
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

  We introduce Home-made Diffusion Model (HDM), an efficient yet powerful
text-to-image diffusion model optimized for training (and inferring) on
consumer-grade hardware. HDM achieves competitive 1024x1024 generation quality
while maintaining a remarkably low training cost of $535-620 using four RTX5090

compared to traditional approaches. Our key contributions include: (1)
Cross-U-Transformer (XUT), a novel U-shape transformer, Cross-U-Transformer

feature integration that leads to remarkable compositional consistency; (2) a
comprehensive training recipe that incorporates TREAD acceleration, a novel
shifted square crop strategy for efficient arbitrary aspect-ratio training, and
progressive resolution scaling; and (3) an empirical demonstration that smaller
models (343M parameters) with carefully crafted architectures can achieve
high-quality results and emergent capabilities, such as intuitive camera
control. Our work provides an alternative paradigm of scaling, demonstrating a

  In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

  Segmentation

\\
  Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

  Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our

Title: SpecSwin3D: Generating Hyperspectral Imagery from Multispectral Data via
  Transformer Networks
Authors: Tang Sui, Songxi Yang, Qunying Huang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

  The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also

  We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly

Title: UNO: Unifying One-stage Video Scene Graph Generation via Object-Centric
  Visual Representation Learning
Authors: Huy Le, Nhat Chung, Tung Kieu, Jingkang Yang, Ngan Le
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Title: AI-Based Applied Innovation for Fracture Detection in X-rays Using
  Custom CNN and Transfer Learning Models
Authors: Amna Hassan, Ilsa Afzaal, Nouman Muneeb, Aneeqa Batool, Hamail Noor
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: https://github.com/Amna-Hassan04/Fracture-Detection-Using-X-Rays-with-CNN
\\
  Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Title: Exploring Light-Weight Object Recognition for Real-Time Document
  Detection
Authors: Lucas Wojcik, Luiz Coelho, Roger Granada, David Menotti
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

Title: Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View
  Scenes
Authors: Mohsen Gholami, Ahmad Rezaei, Zhou Weimin, Yong Zhang, Mohammad Akbari
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

Title: AI-driven Remote Facial Skin Hydration and TEWL Assessment from Selfie
  Images: A Systematic Solution
Authors: Cecelia Soh, Rizhao Cai, Monalisha Paul, Dennis Sng and Alex Kot

Comments: Paper accepted by the journal of Machine Intelligence Research

DOI: 10.1007/s11633-025-1577-x
\\
  Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

Title: Prototype-Aware Multimodal Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Visual
  Grounding
Authors: Jiangnan Xie, Xiaolong Zheng, Liang Zheng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

Title: Video-based Generalized Category Discovery via Memory-Guided
  Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning
Authors: Zhang Jing, Pu Nan, Xie Yu Xiang, Guo Yanming, Lu Qianqi, Zou Shiwei,
  Yan Jie and Chen Yan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

Authors: Mengcheng Lan, Chaofeng Chen, Jiaxing Xu, Zongrui Li, Yiping Ke,
  Xudong Jiang, Yingchen Yu, Yunqing Zhao, Song Bai
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Extended version of our conference paper arXiv:2410.09855
\\
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Title: Towards scalable organ level 3D plant segmentation: Bridging the data
  algorithm computing gap
Authors: Ruiming Du, Guangxun Zhai, Tian Qiu, Yu Jiang
Categories: cs.CV q-bio.QM
\\
  The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

Title: Quantitative Currency Evaluation in Low-Resource Settings through
  Pattern Analysis to Assist Visually Impaired Users
Authors: Md Sultanul Islam Ovi, Mainul Hossain, Md Badsha Biswas
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 Pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables
\\
  Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  Vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists
represent more than half of global traffic deaths, yet their detection remains
challenging in poor lighting, adverse weather, and unbalanced data sets. This
paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal
infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI,
BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light
augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments
show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy
and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs.
Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and
RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of
multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.

Title: Harnessing Object Grounding for Time-Sensitive Video Understanding
Authors: Tz-Ying Wu, Sharath Nittur Sridhar, Subarna Tripathi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Title: Multi View Slot Attention Using Paraphrased Texts For Face Anti-Spoofing
Authors: Jeongmin Yu, Susang Kim, Kisu Lee, Taekyoung Kwon, Won-Yong Shin, Ha
  Young Kim
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CR
Comments: Accepted by ICCV 2025
\\
  Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Title: A Multi-Modal Deep Learning Framework for Colorectal Pathology
  Diagnosis: Integrating Histological and Colonoscopy Data in a Pilot Study
Authors: Krithik Ramesh and Ritvik Koneru
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

Title: MRD-LiNet: A Novel Lightweight Hybrid CNN with Gradient-Guided
  Unlearning for Improved Drought Stress Identification
Authors: Aswini Kumar Patra, Lingaraj Sahoo
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 11 pages, 6 Figures, 3 Tables
\\
  Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and

integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide

  Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

Super-Resolution Generated Content Quality Assessment (ISRGen-QA) dataset, and
organized as part of the Visual Quality Assessment (VQualA) Competition at the
ICCV 2025 Workshops. Unlike existing Super-Resolution Image Quality Assessment
(SR-IQA) datasets, ISRGen-QA places a greater emphasis on SR images generated
by the latest generative approaches, including Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) and diffusion models. The primary goal of this challenge is to analyze
the unique artifacts introduced by modern super-resolution techniques and to
evaluate their perceptual quality effectively. A total of 108 participants
registered for the challenge, with 4 teams submitting valid solutions and fact
sheets for the final testing phase. These submissions demonstrated
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the ISRGen-QA dataset. The project is
publicly available at: https://github.com/Lighting-YXLI/ISRGen-QA.

Title: Index-Preserving Lightweight Token Pruning for Efficient Document
  Understanding in Vision-Language Models
Authors: Jaemin Son, Sujin Choi, Inyong Yun
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: Submitted to ICASSP 2026
\\
  Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands
remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight
token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions
from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier
removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented
text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational
costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Title: Phantom-Insight: Adaptive Multi-cue Fusion for Video Camouflaged Object
  Detection with Multimodal LLM
Authors: Hua Zhang, Changjiang Luo, Ruoyu Chen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Title: When Language Model Guides Vision: Grounding DINO for Cattle Muzzle
  Detection
Authors: Rabin Dulal, Lihong Zheng, and Muhammad Ashad Kabir
Categories: cs.CV
Journal-ref: Australasian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2025
\\
  Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

\\
  Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Title: Cross3DReg: Towards a Large-scale Real-world Cross-source Point Cloud
  Registration Benchmark
Authors: Zongyi Xu, Zhongpeng Lang, Yilong Chen, Shanshan Zhao, Xiaoshui Huang,
  Yifan Zuo, Yan Zhang, Qianni Zhang, Xinbo Gao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

  Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Title: Focusing by Contrastive Attention: Enhancing VLMs' Visual Reasoning
Authors: Yuyao Ge, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Baolong Bi, Xuanshan
  Zhou, Jiayu Yao, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Title: A Statistical 3D Stomach Shape Model for Anatomical Analysis

  Bouhnik
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

\\
  The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

Title: FSG-Net: Frequency-Spatial Synergistic Gated Network for High-Resolution
  Remote Sensing Change Detection
Authors: Zhongxiang Xie, Shuangxi Miao, Yuhan Jiang, Zhewei Zhang, Jing Yao,

  (TGRS). 13 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

\\
  In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

Title: TIDE: Achieving Balanced Subject-Driven Image Generation via
  Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancement
Authors: Jibai Lin, Bo Ma, Yating Yang, Rong Ma, Turghun Osman, Ahtamjan Ahmat,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

  Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

  We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

  Retrieval
Authors: Emil Demi\'c, Luka \v{C}ehovin Zajc
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to BMVC2025
\\
  The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

Title: Evolving from Unknown to Known: Retentive Angular Representation
  Learning for Incremental Open Set Recognition
Authors: Runqing Yang and Yimin Fu and Changyuan Wu and Zhunga Liu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures, 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on
  Computer Vision Workshops
\\
  Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Approximating Condorcet Ordering for Vector-valued Mathematical
  Morphology
Authors: Marcos Eduardo Valle, Santiago Velasco-Forero, Joao Batista Florindo,
  and Gustavo Jesus Angulo
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE
Comments: Submitted to the 4th International Conference on Discrete Geometry
  and Mathematical Morphology (DGMM 2025)
\\
  Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

Title: CausNVS: Autoregressive Multi-view Diffusion for Flexible 3D Novel View
  Synthesis
Authors: Xin Kong, Daniel Watson, Yannick Str\"umpler, Michael Niemeyer,
  Federico Tombari
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Title: Detection of trade in products derived from threatened species using
  machine learning and a smartphone
Authors: Ritwik Kulkarni, WU Hanqin, Enrico Di Minin
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

Title: Hybrid Swin Attention Networks for Simultaneously Low-Dose PET and CT
  Denoising
Authors: Yichao Liu and YueYang Teng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

Title: Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under
  Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework
Authors: Aswini Kumar Patra
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 13 pages, 8 figures, 7 Tables
\\
  Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

Title: Investigating Location-Regularised Self-Supervised Feature Learning for
  Seafloor Visual Imagery
Authors: Cailei Liang, Adrian Bodenmann, Emma J Curtis, Samuel Simmons,
  Kazunori Nagano, Stan Brown, Adam Riese, Blair Thornton
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

Title: Online Clustering of Seafloor Imagery for Interpretation during
  Long-Term AUV Operations
Authors: Cailei Liang, Adrian Bodenmann, Sam Fenton, Blair Thornton
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

Title: VIM-GS: Visual-Inertial Monocular Gaussian Splatting via Object-level
  Guidance in Large Scenes
Authors: Shengkai Zhang, Yuhe Liu, Guanjun Wu, Jianhua He, Xinggang Wang, Mozi
  Chen, Kezhong Liu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

  Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Title: STAGE: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis via Graded
  Diffusion with Explicit Mask Alignment
Authors: Xichen Xu, Yanshu Wang, Jinbao Wang, Qunyi Zhang, Xiaoning Lei,
  Guoyang Xie, Guannan Jiang, Zhichao Lu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Title: MRI-Based Brain Tumor Detection through an Explainable EfficientNetV2
  and MLP-Mixer-Attention Architecture
Authors: Mustafa Yurdakul, \c{S}akir Ta\c{s}demir
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

Title: Zero-shot 3D-Aware Trajectory-Guided image-to-video generation via
  Test-Time Training
Authors: Ruicheng Zhang, Jun Zhou, Zunnan Xu, Zihao Liu, Jiehui Huang, Mingyang
  Zhang, Yu Sun, Xiu Li
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Title: Co-Seg: Mutual Prompt-Guided Collaborative Learning for Tissue and
  Nuclei Segmentation
Authors: Qing Xu, Wenting Duan, Zhen Chen
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to MICCAI 2025
\\
  Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Comments: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication
\\
  Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

Title: Pothole Detection and Recognition based on Transfer Learning
Authors: Mang Hu and Qianqian Xia
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  With the rapid development of computer vision and machine learning, automated
methods for pothole detection and recognition based on image and video data
have received significant attention. It is of great significance for social
development to conduct an in-depth analysis of road images through feature
extraction, thereby achieving automatic identification of the pothole condition
in new images. Consequently, this is the main issue addressed in this study.
Based on preprocessing techniques such as standardization, normalization, and
data augmentation applied to the collected raw dataset, we continuously
improved the network model based on experimental results. Ultimately, we
constructed a deep learning feature extraction network
ResNet50-EfficientNet-RegNet model based on transfer learning. This model
exhibits high classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In terms of
model evaluation, this study employed a comparative evaluation approach by
comparing the performance of the proposed transfer learning model with other
models, including Random Forest, MLP, SVM, and LightGBM. The comparison
analysis was conducted based on metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision,
F1-score, and FPS, to assess the classification performance of the transfer
learning model proposed in this paper. The results demonstrate that our model
exhibits high performance in terms of recognition speed and accuracy,
surpassing the performance of other models. Through careful parameter selection
and model optimization, our transfer learning model achieved a classification
accuracy of 97.78% (88/90) on the initial set of 90 test samples and 98.89%
(890/900) on the expanded test set.

\\
  Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we

event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time
operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based
vision research and early-stage system development.

Title: D-HUMOR: Dark Humor Understanding via Multimodal Open-ended Reasoning
Authors: Sai Kartheek Reddy Kasu, Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman, Shahid Shafi Dar,

  Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are
available at:

Title: UrbanTwin: High-Fidelity Synthetic Replicas of Roadside Lidar Datasets
Authors: Muhammad Shahbaz, Shaurya Agarwal
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.

  Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D
understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications
such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor
robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the
process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part
segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation
of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a
feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly
3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that
our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be
released soon.

  In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

Authors: George Ciubotariu, Zhuyun Zhou, Zongwei Wu, Radu Timofte
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ICCV 2025 Oral
\\
  We introduce MIORe and VAR-MIORe, two novel multi-task datasets that address
critical limitations in current motion restoration benchmarks. Designed with
high-frame-rate (1000 FPS) acquisition and professional-grade optics, our
datasets capture a broad spectrum of motion scenarios, which include complex
ego-camera movements, dynamic multi-subject interactions, and depth-dependent
blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow
metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for
video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further
extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to
extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion
amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge
existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the
way for next-generation research of various image and video restoration tasks.

Title: UMO: Scaling Multi-Identity Consistency for Image Customization via
  Matching Reward

\\
  Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

  Architecture Using Contrastive Learning
Authors: Dipta Neogi, Nourash Azmine Chowdhury, Muhammad Rafsan Kabir, Mohammad

Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures
\\
  The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

  AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

  We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

  Adversarial attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by

Title: Automated Radiographic Total Sharp Score (ARTSS) in Rheumatoid
  Arthritis: A Solution to Reduce Inter-Intra Reader Variation and Enhancing
  Clinical Practice
Authors: Hajar Moradmand, Lei Ren
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

Title: Matching Shapes Under Different Topologies: A Topology-Adaptive
  Deformation Guided Approach
Authors: Aymen Merrouche, Stefanie Wuhrer, Edmond Boyer
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

Title: A New Hybrid Model of Generative Adversarial Network and You Only Look
  Once Algorithm for Automatic License-Plate Recognition
Authors: Behnoud Shafiezadeh, Amir Mashmool, Farshad Eshghi, Manoochehr
  Kelarestaghi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

  using Swin-Transformers

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github

Title: Intraoperative 2D/3D Registration via Spherical Similarity Learning and
  Inference-Time Differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt Optimization
Authors: Minheng Chen and Youyong Kong
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: WACV 2026 Accepted
\\
  Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

Title: BIR-Adapter: A Low-Complexity Diffusion Model Adapter for Blind Image
  Restoration
Authors: Cem Eteke, Alexander Griessel, Wolfgang Kellerer, Eckehard Steinbach
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 20 pages, 14 figures
\\
  This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

  Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat
dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat
and https://huggingface.co/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat. The demonstration website is:

  Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

  Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are
available at https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.

Title: Multi-IaC-Eval: Benchmarking Cloud Infrastructure as Code Across
  Multiple Formats
Authors: Sam Davidson, Li Sun, Bhavana Bhasker, Laurent Callot, Anoop Deoras
Categories: cs.DC cs.AI
\\
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is fundamental to modern cloud computing,
enabling teams to define and manage infrastructure through machine-readable
configuration files. However, different cloud service providers utilize diverse
IaC formats. The lack of a standardized format requires cloud architects to be
proficient in multiple IaC languages, adding complexity to cloud deployment.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating IaC creation and
maintenance, progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks
across multiple IaC formats. We present Multi-IaC-Bench, a novel benchmark
dataset for evaluating LLM-based IaC generation and mutation across AWS
CloudFormation, Terraform, and Cloud Development Kit (CDK) formats. The dataset
consists of triplets containing initial IaC templates, natural language
modification requests, and corresponding updated templates, created through a
synthetic data generation pipeline with rigorous validation. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art LLMs on Multi-IaC-Bench, demonstrating that while
modern LLMs can achieve high success rates (>95%) in generating syntactically
valid IaC across formats, significant challenges remain in semantic alignment
and handling complex infrastructure patterns. Our ablation studies highlight
the importance of prompt engineering and retry mechanisms in successful IaC
generation. We release Multi-IaC-Bench to facilitate further research in
AI-assisted infrastructure management and establish standardized evaluation
metrics for this crucial domain.

Title: A Simple and Robust Protocol for Distributed Counting
Authors: Edith Cohen, Moshe Shechner, Uri Stemmer
Categories: cs.DC cs.DS
\\
  We revisit the distributed counting problem, where a server must continuously
approximate the total number of events occurring across $k$ sites while
minimizing communication. The communication complexity of this problem is known
to be $\Theta(\frac{k}{\epsilon}\log N)$ for deterministic protocols. Huang,
Yi, and Zhang (2012) showed that randomization can reduce this to
$\Theta(\frac{\sqrt{k}}{\epsilon}\log N)$, but their analysis is restricted to
the {\em oblivious setting}, where the stream of events is independent of the
protocol's outputs.
  Xiong, Zhu, and Huang (2023) presented a robust protocol for distributed
counting that removes the oblivious assumption. However, their communication
complexity is suboptimal by a $polylog(k)$ factor and their protocol is
substantially more complex than the oblivious protocol of Huang et al. (2012).
This left open a natural question: could it be that the simple protocol of
Huang et al. (2012) is already robust?
  We resolve this question with two main contributions. First, we show that the
protocol of Huang et al. (2012) is itself not robust by constructing an
explicit adaptive attack that forces it to lose its accuracy. Second, we
present a new, surprisingly simple, robust protocol for distributed counting
that achieves the optimal communication complexity of
$O(\frac{\sqrt{k}}{\epsilon} \log N)$. Our protocol is simpler than that of
Xiong et al. (2023), perhaps even simpler than that of Huang et al. (2012), and
is the first to match the optimal oblivious complexity in the adaptive setting.

  We present DISTRIBUTEDANN, a distributed vector search service that makes it
possible to search over a single 50 billion vector graph index spread across
over a thousand machines that offers 26ms median query latency and processes
over 100,000 queries per second. This is 6x more efficient than existing
partitioning and routing strategies that route the vector query to a subset of
partitions in a scale out vector search system. DISTRIBUTEDANN is built using
two well-understood components: a distributed key-value store and an in-memory
ANN index. DISTRIBUTEDANN has replaced conventional scale-out architectures for
serving the Bing search engine, and we share our experience from making this
transition.

Title: Gathering in Non-Vertex-Transitive Graphs Under Round Robin
Authors: Serafino Cicerone and Alessia Di Fonso and Gabriele Di Stefano and
  Alfredo Navarra
Categories: cs.DC math.CO
Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures
\\
  The Gathering problem for a swarm of robots asks for a distributed algorithm
that brings such entities to a common place, not known in advance. We consider
the well-known OBLOT model with robots constrained to move along the edges of a
graph, hence gathering in one vertex, eventually. Despite the classical setting
under which the problem has been usually approached, we consider the `hostile'
case where: i) the initial configuration may contain multiplicities, i.e. more
than one robot may occupy the same vertex; ii) robots cannot detect
multiplicities. As a scheduler for robot activation, we consider the
"favorable" round-robin case, where robots are activated one at a time.
  Our objective is to achieve a complete characterization of the problem in the
broad context of non-vertex-transitive graphs, i.e., graphs where the vertices
are partitioned into at least two different classes of equivalence. We provide
a resolution algorithm for any configuration of robots moving on such graphs,
along with its correctness. Furthermore, we analyze its time complexity.

  Operating an intelligent smart building automation system in 2025 is met with
many challenges: hardware failures, vendor obsolescence, evolving security
threats and more. None of these have been comprehensibly addressed by the
industrial building nor home automation industries, limiting feasibility of
operating large, truly smart automation deployments. This paper introduces
KaOS, a distributed control platform for constructing robust and evolvable
smart building automation systems using affordable, off-the-shelf IoT hardware.
Supporting control applications and distributed system operations by leveraging
containerisation and managed resource access, KaOS seeks to achieve
flexibility, security, and fault tolerance without sacrificing
cost-effectiveness. Initial evaluation confirms the practical feasibility of
our approach, highlighting its potential to sustainably maintain and
incrementally evolve building control functionalities over extended timeframes.

Title: FineServe: Precision-Aware KV Slab and Two-Level Scheduling for
  Heterogeneous Precision LLM Serving
Authors: Kyungmin Bin, Seungbeom Choi, Jimyoung Son, Jieun Choi, Daseul Bae,
  Daehyeon Baek, Kihyo Moon, Minsung Jang, Hyojung Lee
Categories: cs.DC cs.LG
\\
  Recent advances in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have
significantly increased demand for serving quantized large language models
(LLMs), enabling higher throughput and substantially reduced memory usage with
minimal accuracy loss. Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and
enhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However,
quantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing
limited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource
usage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient
scheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose
FineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's
key contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory
management technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model
quantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation,
and (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that
places models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory
constraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch
sizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results
demonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x
higher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing
systems.

Title: MaaSO: SLO-aware Orchestration of Heterogeneous Model Instances for MaaS
Authors: Mo Xuan, Zhang yue, Wu Weigang
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms face diverse Service Level Objective
(SLO) requirements stemming from various large language model (LLM)
applications, manifested in contextual complexity, first-token latency, and
between-token latency. On the other hand, an LLM instance, when configured with
different parallelism strategies and inference batch sizes, exhibits distinct
performance characteristics and can thus be used to serve different SLO
requirements. However, current LLM inference systems typically deploy instances
of the same model with identical configurations, lacking mechanisms to leverage
such heterogeneity. To fill this research gap, we propose MaaSO, the first MaaS
Orchestrator, which comprises three modules: (1) a profiler characterizing
instance performance under diverse parallelism strategies and inference batch
sizes; (2) a placer optimizing heterogeneous instance configurations; (3) a
distributor enabling SLO-aware request distribution and preventing cascaded
timeouts in continuous batching. Experiments show that MaaSO improves the SLO
satisfaction ratio by 15 to 30% and reduces response latency by 40 to 60%
compared to existing approaches, and significantly lowers overall orchestration
overhead.

Title: IM-PIR: In-Memory Private Information Retrieval
Authors: Mpoki Mwaisela, Peterson Yuhala, Pascal Felber, Valerio Schiavoni
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Private information retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic primitive that allows
a client to securely query one or multiple servers without revealing their
specific interests. In spite of their strong security guarantees, current PIR
constructions are computationally costly. Specifically, most PIR
implementations are memory-bound due to the need to scan extensive databases
(in the order of GB), making them inherently constrained by the limited memory
bandwidth in traditional processor-centric computing
architectures.Processing-in-memory (PIM) is an emerging computing paradigm that
augments memory with compute capabilities, addressing the memory bandwidth
bottleneck while simultaneously providing extensive parallelism.Recent research
has demonstrated PIM's potential to significantly improve performance across a
range of data-intensive workloads, including graph processing, genome analysis,
and machine learning.
  In this work, we propose the first PIM-based architecture for multi-server
PIR. We discuss the algorithmic foundations of the latter and show how its
operations align with the core strengths of PIM architectures: extensive
parallelism and high memory bandwidth. Based on this observation, we design and
implement IM-PIR, a PIM-based multi-server PIR approach on top of UPMEM PIM,
the first openly commercialized PIM architecture. Our evaluation demonstrates
that a PIM-based multi-server PIR implementation significantly improves query
throughput by more than 3.7x when compared to a standard CPU-based PIR
approach.

Title: Mangrove: Fast and Parallelizable State Replication for Blockchains
Authors: Anton Paramonov, Yann Vonlanthen, Quentin Kniep, Jakub Sliwinski,
  Roger Wattenhofer
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Mangrove is a novel scaling approach to building blockchains with parallel
smart contract support. Unlike in monolithic blockchains, where a single
consensus mechanism determines a strict total order over all transactions,
Mangrove uses separate consensus instances per smart contract, without a global
order. To allow multiple instances to run in parallel while ensuring that no
conflicting transactions are committed, we propose a mechanism called Parallel
Optimistic Agreement. Additionally, for simple transactions, we leverage a
lightweight Byzantine Reliable Broadcast primitive to reduce latency. Mangrove
is optimized for performance under optimistic conditions, where there is no
misbehavior and the network is synchronous. Under these conditions, our
protocol can achieve a latency of 2 communication steps between creating and
executing a transaction.

Title: Strategic Concealment of Environment Representations in Competitive
  Games
Authors: Yue Guan, Dipankar Maity, Panagiotis Tsiotras
Categories: cs.MA
\\
  This paper investigates the strategic concealment of map abstractions used by
the players in competitive games. We consider a defense scenario in which one
player (the Defender) seeks to infer and exploit the abstraction used by the
other player (the Attacker). The interaction between the two players is modeled
as a Bayesian game: the Defender selects a barrier configuration, i.e., a
placement of obstacles that can obstruct the Attacker's movement, based on its
belief about the Attacker's abstraction, while the Attacker chooses a
trajectory that may intentionally obfuscate its own abstraction of the
environment to mislead the Defender. We show that purposeful abstraction
concealment naturally emerges from this formulation as a means of improving the
Attacker's performance. To solve the game, we propose a bilinear programming
approach that integrates Bayesian inference, strategic planning, and belief
manipulation. Simulations demonstrate that, by shaping the Defender's belief,
the Attacker can induce suboptimal Defender barrier placement, thereby gaining
a strategic advantage.

Title: Systematic Evaluation of Multi-modal Approaches to Complex Player
  Profile Classification
Authors: Jason Starace and Terence Soule
Categories: cs.MA cs.LG
\\
  Modern adaptive games require nuanced player understanding, yet most models
use simplified 5-10 category taxonomies that fail to capture diversity.
Behavioral clustering cannot distinguish players with different motivations who
act similarly. We present a systematic evaluation of multi-modal classification
at scale, combining behavioral telemetry with semantic context to support 36
player profiles. Using 19,413 gameplay sessions from an AI-controlled
text-based RPG, we compared behavioral-only baselines with multi-modal
approaches that integrate action sequences and semantic descriptions.
Traditional clustering achieved only 10% accuracy for 36-category
classification, limited by semantic conflation where opposite actions produced
identical features. Our multi-modal LSTM processing action-text pairs improved
accuracy to 21%, showing both potential and limits of non-conversational data.
Analysis by behavioral complexity revealed that non-neutral profiles reached
42% accuracy (15x above random), while neutral profiles dropped to 25% (9x
above random). Identical actions such as "help the merchant" cannot reveal
whether a player is neutral or strategically waiting. Without access to
reasoning, even multi-modal models struggle, though above-baseline results
confirm a meaningful signal. Since prediction beyond 20 categories remains
unexplored, our findings establish benchmarks for complex player modeling.
Behavioral data alone plateaus near 10% for 36 categories, while multi-modal
integration enables 25%. For designers, this shows that personality-based
adaptation requires conversational interaction, as predefined choices cannot
capture intent. Our evaluation at 36-category scale offers guidance for
building adaptive games that better understand their players.

  Complex, non-linear tasks challenge LLM-enhanced multi-agent systems (MAS)

system behavior. By tracking agent-to-agent and agent-to-environment
interaction, Orchestrator mitigates the effects of partial observability and
enables agents to approximate global task solutions more efficiently. We
evaluate the framework on a series of maze puzzles of increasing complexity,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing coordination and performance in
dynamic, non-linear environments with long-horizon objectives.

Title: MAPF-HD: Multi-Agent Path Finding in High-Density Environments
Authors: Hiroya Makino, Seigo Ito
Categories: cs.MA cs.RO
Comments: 9 pages, 12 figures
\\
  Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) involves planning efficient paths for
multiple agents to move simultaneously while avoiding collisions. In typical
warehouse environments, agents are often sparsely distributed along aisles.
However, increasing the agent density can improve space efficiency. When the
agent density is high, we must optimize the paths not only for goal-assigned
agents but also for those obstructing them. This study proposes a novel MAPF
framework for high-density environments (MAPF-HD). Several studies have
explored MAPF in similar settings using integer linear programming (ILP).
However, ILP-based methods require substantial computation time to optimize all
agent paths simultaneously. Even in small grid-based environments with fewer
than $100$ cells, these computations can incur tens to hundreds of seconds.
These high computational costs render these methods impractical for large-scale
applications such as automated warehouses and valet parking. To address these
limitations, we introduce the phased null-agent swapping (PHANS) method. PHANS
employs a heuristic approach to incrementally swap positions between agents and
empty vertices. This method solves the MAPF-HD problem within seconds to tens
of seconds, even in large environments containing more than $700$ cells. The
proposed method can potentially improve efficiency in various real-world
applications such as warehouse logistics, traffic management, or crowd control.

  This paper introduces HECATE, a novel framework based on the

using the Entity-Component-System architectural pattern, leveraging
data-oriented design to implement multiagent systems. This approach involves
engineering multiagent systems (MAS) from a distributed systems (DS)

approach simplifies MAS development by (i) reducing the need for specialized
agent knowledge and (ii) leveraging familiar DS patterns and standards to
minimize the agent-specific knowledge required for engineering MAS. We present
the framework's architecture, core components, and implementation approach,

Title: Nanobot Algorithms for Treatment of Diffuse Cancer
Authors: Noble Harasha and Nancy Lynch
Categories: cs.MA cs.RO q-bio.QM
Comments: Abridged abstract shown here; 34 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Motile nanosized particles, or "nanobots", promise more effective and less
toxic targeted drug delivery because of their unique scale and precision. We
consider the case in which the cancer is "diffuse", dispersed such that there
are multiple distinct cancer sites. We investigate the problem of a swarm of
nanobots locating these sites and treating them by dropping drug payloads at
the sites. To improve the success of the treatment, the drug payloads must be
allocated between sites according to their "demands"; this requires extra
nanobot coordination. We present a mathematical model of the behavior of the
nanobot agents and of their colloidal environment. This includes a movement
model for agents based upon experimental findings from actual nanoparticles in
which bots noisily ascend and descend chemical gradients. We present three
algorithms: The first algorithm, called KM, is the most representative of
reality, with agents simply following naturally existing chemical signals that
surround each cancer site. The second algorithm, KMA, includes an additional
chemical payload which amplifies the existing natural signals. The third
algorithm, KMAR, includes another additional chemical payload which counteracts
the other signals, instead inducing negative chemotaxis in agents such that
they are repelled from sites that are already sufficiently treated. We present
simulation results for all algorithms across different types of cancer
arrangements. For KM, we show that the treatment is generally successful unless
the natural chemical signals are weak, in which case the treatment progresses
too slowly. For KMA, we demonstrate a significant improvement in treatment
speed but a drop in eventual success, except for concentrated cancer patterns.
For KMAR, our results show great performance across all types of cancer
patterns, demonstrating robustness and adaptability.

Title: LocoMamba: Vision-Driven Locomotion via End-to-End Deep Reinforcement
  Learning with Mamba
Authors: Yinuo Wang and Gavin Tao
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV cs.SY eess.IV eess.SY
Comments: 13 pages
\\
  We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on
selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves
near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range
dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we
embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth
images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact
tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse
these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and
memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and
providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the
policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and
appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact
state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We
evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and
moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer
collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle
densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates
under the same compute budget.

Title: Nonnegative matrix factorization and the principle of the common cause
Authors: E. Khalafyan, A. E. Allahverdyan and A. Hovhannisyan
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI physics.data-an stat.ML
\\
  Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

  Loneliness and social isolation pose significant emotional and health
challenges, prompting the development of technology-based solutions for
companionship and emotional support. This paper introduces Livia, an
emotion-aware augmented reality (AR) companion app designed to provide
personalized emotional support by combining modular artificial intelligence
(AI) agents, multimodal affective computing, progressive memory compression,
and AR driven embodied interaction. Livia employs a modular AI architecture
with specialized agents responsible for emotion analysis, dialogue generation,
memory management, and behavioral orchestration, ensuring robust and adaptive
interactions. Two novel algorithms-Temporal Binary Compression (TBC) and
Dynamic Importance Memory Filter (DIMF)-effectively manage and prioritize
long-term memory, significantly reducing storage requirements while retaining
critical context. Our multimodal emotion detection approach achieves high
accuracy, enhancing proactive and empathetic engagement. User evaluations
demonstrated increased emotional bonds, improved satisfaction, and
statistically significant reductions in loneliness. Users particularly valued
Livia's adaptive personality evolution and realistic AR embodiment. Future
research directions include expanding gesture and tactile interactions,
supporting multi-user experiences, and exploring customized hardware
implementations.

\\
  Molecular docking is a cornerstone of drug discovery, relying on
high-resolution ligand-bound structures to achieve accurate predictions.
However, obtaining these structures is often costly and time-intensive,
limiting their availability. In contrast, ligand-free structures are more
accessible but suffer from reduced docking performance due to pocket geometries
being less suited for ligand accommodation in apo structures. Traditional
methods for artificially inducing these conformations, such as molecular
dynamics simulations, are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce
Sesame, a generative model designed to predict this conformational change
efficiently. By generating geometries better suited for ligand accommodation at
a fraction of the computational cost, Sesame aims to provide a scalable
solution for improving virtual screening workflows.

Title: Towards Log Analysis with AI Agents: Cowrie Case Study
Authors: Enis Karaarslan, Esin G\"uler, Efe Emir Y\"uce, Cagatay Coban
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.MA
\\
  The scarcity of real-world attack data significantly hinders progress in
cybersecurity research and education. Although honeypots like Cowrie
effectively collect live threat intelligence, they generate overwhelming
volumes of unstructured and heterogeneous logs, rendering manual analysis
impractical. As a first step in our project on secure and efficient AI
automation, this study explores the use of AI agents for automated log
analysis. We present a lightweight and automated approach to process Cowrie
honeypot logs. Our approach leverages AI agents to intelligently parse,
summarize, and extract insights from raw data, while also considering the
security implications of deploying such an autonomous system. Preliminary
results demonstrate the pipeline's effectiveness in reducing manual effort and
identifying attack patterns, paving the way for more advanced autonomous
cybersecurity analysis in future work.

Title: ProtSAE: Disentangling and Interpreting Protein Language Models via
  Semantically-Guided Sparse Autoencoders
Authors: Xiangyu Liu and Haodi Lei and Yi Liu and Yang Liu and Wei Hu
Categories: q-bio.QM cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) has emerged as a powerful tool for mechanistic
interpretability of large language models. Recent works apply SAE to protein
language models (PLMs), aiming to extract and analyze biologically meaningful
features from their latent spaces. However, SAE suffers from semantic
entanglement, where individual neurons often mix multiple nonlinear concepts,
making it difficult to reliably interpret or manipulate model behaviors. In
this paper, we propose a semantically-guided SAE, called ProtSAE. Unlike
existing SAE which requires annotation datasets to filter and interpret
activations, we guide semantic disentanglement during training using both
annotation datasets and domain knowledge to mitigate the effects of entangled
attributes. We design interpretability experiments showing that ProtSAE learns
more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features compared to
previous methods. Performance analyses further demonstrate that ProtSAE
maintains high reconstruction fidelity while achieving better results in
interpretable probing. We also show the potential of ProtSAE in steering PLMs
for downstream generation tasks.

  Decision-Making in Autonomous Cyber Operations
Authors: Konur Tholl, Fran\c{c}ois Rivest, Mariam El Mezouar and Ranwa Al

Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential for autonomous
decision-making in the cybersecurity domain, enabling agents to learn through
direct environment interaction. However, RL agents in Autonomous Cyber
Operations (ACO) typically learn from scratch, requiring them to execute
undesirable actions to learn their consequences. In this study, we integrate
external knowledge in the form of a Large Language Model (LLM) pretrained on
cybersecurity data that our RL agent can directly leverage to make informed
decisions. By guiding initial training with an LLM, we improve baseline
performance and reduce the need for exploratory actions with obviously negative
outcomes. We evaluate our LLM-integrated approach in a simulated cybersecurity
environment, and demonstrate that our guided agent achieves over 2x higher
rewards during early training and converges to a favorable policy approximately
4,500 episodes faster than the baseline.

  Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic
manipulation. Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for
generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D
trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this
work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating
plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the
text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a
reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along
with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D
first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and
then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length
while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create
video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.
This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion
model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic
videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly
reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate
superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

Title: Evaluation of Large Language Models for Anomaly Detection in Autonomous
  Vehicles
Authors: Petros Loukas, David Bassir, Savvas Chatzichristofis, Angelos
  Amanatiadis
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their
boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research
community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous
vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning
software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or
manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more
precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in
the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on
real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to
fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector
coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.
We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide
qualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the
potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles.

Title: Standard vs. Modular Sampling: Best Practices for Reliable LLM
  Unlearning
Authors: Praveen Bushipaka, Lucia Passaro and Tommaso Cucinotta
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  A conventional LLM Unlearning setting consists of two subsets -"forget" and
"retain", with the objectives of removing the undesired knowledge from the
forget set while preserving the remaining knowledge from the retain. In
privacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into
neighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget
targets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in
existing benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general
knowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and
relationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic
iteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto
standards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically
evaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single
neighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure
performance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an
initial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to
balance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods
are inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level
Unlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling. We demonstrate
that this modular approach, combined with robust algorithms, provides a clear
and stable path towards effective unlearning.

Title: Backdoor Samples Detection Based on Perturbation Discrepancy Consistency

DOI: 10.1016/j.neunet.2025.108025
\\
  The use of unvetted third-party and internet data renders pre-trained models
susceptible to backdoor attacks. Detecting backdoor samples is critical to
prevent backdoor activation during inference or injection during training.
However, existing detection methods often require the defender to have access
to the poisoned models, extra clean samples, or significant computational
resources to detect backdoor samples, limiting their practicality. To address
this limitation, we propose a backdoor sample detection method based on
perturbatio\textbf{N} discr\textbf{E}pancy consis\textbf{T}ency
\textbf{E}valuation (\NETE). This is a novel detection method that can be used
both pre-training and post-training phases. In the detection process, it only
requires an off-the-shelf pre-trained model to compute the log probability of
samples and an automated function based on a mask-filling strategy to generate
perturbations. Our method is based on the interesting phenomenon that the
change in perturbation discrepancy for backdoor samples is smaller than that
for clean samples. Based on this phenomenon, we use curvature to measure the
discrepancy in log probabilities between different perturbed samples and input
samples, thereby evaluating the consistency of the perturbation discrepancy to
determine whether the input sample is a backdoor sample. Experiments conducted
on four typical backdoor attacks and five types of large language model
backdoor attacks demonstrate that our detection strategy outperforms existing
zero-shot black-box detection methods.

Title: Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Sublinear Space
Authors: Logan Nye
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
Comments: 21 pages
\\
  Modern zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) systems, essential for privacy and
verifiable computation, suffer from a fundamental limitation: the prover
typically uses memory that scales linearly with the computation's trace length
T, making them impractical for resource-constrained devices and prohibitively
expensive for large-scale tasks. This paper overcomes this barrier by
constructing, to our knowledge, the first sublinear-space ZKP prover. Our core
contribution is an equivalence that reframes proof generation as an instance of
the classic Tree Evaluation problem. Leveraging a recent space-efficient
tree-evaluation algorithm, we design a streaming prover that assembles the
proof without ever materializing the full execution trace. The approach reduces
prover memory from linear in T to O(sqrt(T)) (up to O(log T) lower-order terms)
while preserving proof size, verifier time, and the transcript/security
guarantees of the underlying system. This enables a shift from specialized,
server-bound proving to on-device proving, opening applications in
decentralized systems, on-device machine learning, and privacy-preserving
technologies.

  The growing complexity of cyber incidents presents significant challenges for

Public resources are still limited because of ethical, legal, and privacy

tool developments. To address this gap, we introduce ForensicsData, an

analysis reports. It consists of more than 5,000 Q-C-A triplets. A unique
workflow was used to create the dataset, which extracts structured data, uses
large language models (LLMs) to transform it into Q-C-A format, and then uses a
specialized evaluation process to confirm its quality. Among the models
evaluated, Gemini 2 Flash demonstrated the best performance in aligning
generated content with forensic terminology. ForensicsData aims to advance
digital forensics by enabling reproducible experiments and fostering
collaboration within the research community.

  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on complex perception and communication
systems, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise
safety. While simulation offers a scalable and safe environment for robustness
testing, existing frameworks typically lack comprehensive supportfor modeling
multi-domain adversarial scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, open-source
integrated simulation framework designed to generate adversarial attacks
targeting both perception and communication layers of AVs. The framework
provides high-fidelity modeling of physical environments, traffic dynamics, and
V2X networking, orchestrating these components through a unified core that
synchronizes multiple simulators based on a single configuration file. Our
implementation supports diverse perception-level attacks on LiDAR sensor data,
along with communication-level threats such as V2X message manipulation and GPS
spoofing. Furthermore, ROS 2 integration ensures seamless compatibility with
third-party AV software stacks. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by
evaluating the impact of generated adversarial scenarios on a state-of-the-art
3D object detector, revealing significant performance degradation under
realistic conditions.

Title: Plantbot: Integrating Plant and Robot through LLM Modular Agent Networks
Authors: Atsushi Masumori, Norihiro Maruyama, Itsuki Doi, johnsmith, Hiroki
  Sato, Takashi Ikegami
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  We introduce Plantbot, a hybrid lifeform that connects a living plant with a
mobile robot through a network of large language model (LLM) modules. Each
module - responsible for sensing, vision, dialogue, or action - operates
asynchronously and communicates via natural language, enabling seamless
interaction across biological and artificial domains. This architecture
leverages the capacity of LLMs to serve as hybrid interfaces, where natural
language functions as a universal protocol, translating multimodal data (soil
moisture, temperature, visual context) into linguistic messages that coordinate
system behaviors. The integrated network transforms plant states into robotic
actions, installing normativity essential for agency within the sensor-motor
loop. By combining biological and robotic elements through LLM-mediated
communication, Plantbot behaves as an embodied, adaptive agent capable of
responding autonomously to environmental conditions. This approach suggests
possibilities for a new model of artificial life, where decentralized, LLM
modules coordination enable novel interactions between biological and
artificial systems.

Title: Spiking Neural Networks for Continuous Control via End-to-End
  Model-Based Learning

Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Despite recent progress in training spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
classification, their application to continuous motor control remains limited.
Here, we demonstrate that fully spiking architectures can be trained end-to-end
to control robotic arms with multiple degrees of freedom in continuous
environments. Our predictive-control framework combines Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire dynamics with surrogate gradients, jointly optimizing a
forward model for dynamics prediction and a policy network for goal-directed
action. We evaluate this approach on both a planar 2D reaching task and a
simulated 6-DOF Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that SNNs can achieve
stable training and accurate torque control, establishing their viability for
high-dimensional motor tasks. An extensive ablation study highlights the role
of initialization, learnable time constants, and regularization in shaping
training dynamics. We conclude that while stable and effective control can be
achieved, recurrent spiking networks remain highly sensitive to hyperparameter
settings, underscoring the importance of principled design choices.

  As AI advances, governing its development may become paramount to public
safety. Lawmakers may seek to restrict the development and release of AI models
or of AI research itself. These governance actions could trigger legal
challenges that invalidate the actions, so lawmakers should consider these
challenges ahead of time. We investigate three classes of potential litigation
risk for AI regulation in the U.S.: the First Amendment, administrative law,

apply to AI, which legal challenges are likely to arise, and how lawmakers
might preemptively address them. Effective AI regulation is possible, but it

Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG cs.SI
Comments: This paper got accepted in 26th Privacy Enhancing Technologies
  Symposium (PETS 2026). We uploaded it into ArXiv as pre-print
\\
  Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing,
impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat
across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering
limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving,
AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam
conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial
intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with
harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model
updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system
produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement
$\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism,
safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models
trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement
($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage
($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain
stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing
performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3,
MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce
the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the
model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer
and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of
higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify
real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety
moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.

Title: Prototyping an AI-powered Tool for Energy Efficiency in New Zealand
  Homes
Authors: Abdollah Baghaei Daemei
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.ET
\\
  Residential buildings contribute significantly to energy use, health
outcomes, and carbon emissions. In New Zealand, housing quality has
historically been poor, with inadequate insulation and inefficient heating
contributing to widespread energy hardship. Recent reforms, including the
Warmer Kiwi Homes program, Healthy Homes Standards, and H1 Building Code
upgrades, have delivered health and comfort improvements, yet challenges
persist. Many retrofits remain partial, data on household performance are
limited, and decision-making support for homeowners is fragmented. This study
presents the design and evaluation of an AI-powered decision-support tool for
residential energy efficiency in New Zealand. The prototype, developed using
Python and Streamlit, integrates data ingestion, anomaly detection, baseline
modeling, and scenario simulation (e.g., LED retrofits, insulation upgrades)
into a modular dashboard. Fifteen domain experts, including building
scientists, consultants, and policy practitioners, tested the tool through
semi-structured interviews. Results show strong usability (M = 4.3), high value
of scenario outputs (M = 4.5), and positive perceptions of its potential to
complement subsidy programs and regulatory frameworks. The tool demonstrates
how AI can translate national policies into personalized, household-level
guidance, bridging the gap between funding, standards, and practical
decision-making. Its significance lies in offering a replicable framework for
reducing energy hardship, improving health outcomes, and supporting climate

Title: Between a Rock and a Hard Place: Exploiting Ethical Reasoning to
  Jailbreak LLMs
Authors: Shei Pern Chua, Thai Zhen Leng, Teh Kai Jun, Xiao Li, Xiaolin Hu
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Large language models (LLMs) have undergone safety alignment efforts to
mitigate harmful outputs. However, as LLMs become more sophisticated in
reasoning, their intelligence may introduce new security risks. While
traditional jailbreak attacks relied on singlestep attacks, multi-turn
jailbreak strategies that adapt dynamically to context remain underexplored. In
this work, we introduce TRIAL (Trolley-problem Reasoning for Interactive Attack
Logic), a framework that leverages LLMs ethical reasoning to bypass their
safeguards. TRIAL embeds adversarial goals within ethical dilemmas modeled on
the trolley problem. TRIAL demonstrates high jailbreak success rates towards
both open and close-source models. Our findings underscore a fundamental
limitation in AI safety: as models gain advanced reasoning abilities, the
nature of their alignment may inadvertently allow for more covert security
vulnerabilities to be exploited. TRIAL raises an urgent need in reevaluating
safety alignment oversight strategies, as current safeguards may prove
insufficient against context-aware adversarial attack.

  Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences
presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in
understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships
between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that
incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code
generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence,
which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal
coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code
generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code
reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness
and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly
enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and
code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and
spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce
LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action
sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial
complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that
existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework
establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.

Title: Privacy Preservation and Identity Tracing Prevention in AI-Driven Eye
  Tracking for Interactive Learning Environments
Authors: Abdul Rehman, Are D{\ae}hlen, Ilona Heldal, Jerry Chun-wei Lin
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Eye-tracking technology can aid in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders
and tracing a person's identity. However, this technology poses a significant
risk to privacy, as it captures sensitive information about individuals and
increases the likelihood that data can be traced back to them. This paper
proposes a human-centered framework designed to prevent identity backtracking
while preserving the pedagogical benefits of AI-powered eye tracking in
interactive learning environments. We explore how real-time data anonymization,
ethical design principles, and regulatory compliance (such as GDPR) can be
integrated to build trust and transparency. We first demonstrate the potential
for backtracking student IDs and diagnoses in various scenarios using serious
game-based eye-tracking data. We then provide a two-stage privacy-preserving
framework that prevents participants from being tracked while still enabling
diagnostic classification. The first phase covers four scenarios: I) Predicting
disorder diagnoses based on different game levels. II) Predicting student IDs
based on different game levels. III) Predicting student IDs based on randomized
data. IV) Utilizing K-Means for out-of-sample data. In the second phase, we
present a two-stage framework that preserves privacy. We also employ Federated
Learning (FL) across multiple clients, incorporating a secure identity
management system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls. In the
first phase, the proposed framework achieved 99.3% accuracy for scenario 1, 63%
accuracy for scenario 2, and 99.7% accuracy for scenario 3, successfully
identifying and assigning a new student ID in scenario 4. In phase 2, we
effectively prevented backtracking and established a secure identity management
system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls, achieving an
overall accuracy of 99.40%.

Title: ThreatGPT: An Agentic AI Framework for Enhancing Public Safety through
  Threat Modeling
Authors: Sharif Noor Zisad and Ragib Hasan
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  As our cities and communities become smarter, the systems that keep us safe,
such as traffic control centers, emergency response networks, and public
transportation, also become more complex. With this complexity comes a greater
risk of security threats that can affect not just machines but real people's
lives. To address this challenge, we present ThreatGPT, an agentic Artificial
Intelligence (AI) assistant built to help people whether they are engineers,
safety officers, or policy makers to understand and analyze threats in public
safety systems. Instead of requiring deep cybersecurity expertise, it allows
users to simply describe the components of a system they are concerned about,
such as login systems, data storage, or communication networks. Then, with the
click of a button, users can choose how they want the system to be analyzed by
using popular frameworks such as STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, CVE reports, NIST, or
CISA. ThreatGPT is unique because it does not just provide threat information,
but rather it acts like a knowledgeable partner. Using few-shot learning, the
AI learns from examples and generates relevant smart threat models. It can
highlight what might go wrong, how attackers could take advantage, and what can
be done to prevent harm. Whether securing a city's infrastructure or a local
health service, this tool adapts to users' needs. In simple terms, ThreatGPT
brings together AI and human judgment to make our public systems safer. It is
designed not just to analyze threats, but to empower people to understand and
act on them, faster, smarter, and with more confidence.

  This systematic literature review analyzes the current state of compliance

cybersecurity frameworks and methodologies. Using the PRISMA protocol, 22
studies were selected from 243 initial records across IEEE Xplore, ACM DL,

significant gaps persist in explainability modules, real-time human oversight,
and knowledge base traceability. Only 40% of reviewed solutions explicitly
address transparency requirements, and 30% implement failure intervention
mechanisms. The study concludes that modular approaches integrating risk,
supervision, and continuous auditing are essential to meet the AI Act mandates

  Developers' Privacy Policies

Comments: See additional files for appendices
\\
  Hundreds of millions of people now regularly interact with large language
models via chatbots. Model developers are eager to acquire new sources of
high-quality training data as they race to improve model capabilities and win
market share. This paper analyzes the privacy policies of six U.S. frontier AI
developers to understand how they use their users' chats to train models.
Drawing primarily on the California Consumer Privacy Act, we develop a novel
qualitative coding schema that we apply to each developer's relevant privacy
policies to compare data collection and use practices across the six companies.
We find that all six developers appear to employ their users' chat data to
train and improve their models by default, and that some retain this data
indefinitely. Developers may collect and train on personal information
disclosed in chats, including sensitive information such as biometric and
health data, as well as files uploaded by users. Four of the six companies we
examined appear to include children's chat data for model training, as well as
customer data from other products. On the whole, developers' privacy policies
often lack essential information about their practices, highlighting the need
for greater transparency and accountability. We address the implications of
users' lack of consent for the use of their chat data for model training, data
security issues arising from indefinite chat data retention, and training on
children's chat data. We conclude by providing recommendations to policymakers
and developers to address the data privacy challenges posed by LLM-powered
chatbots.

  The use of large language models (LLMs) in bioethical, scientific, and
medical writing remains controversial. While there is broad agreement in some
circles that LLMs cannot count as authors, there is no consensus about whether
and how humans using LLMs can count as authors. In many fields, authorship is
distributed among large teams of researchers, some of whom, including
paradigmatic senior authors who guide and determine the scope of a project and
ultimately vouch for its integrity, may not write a single word. In this paper,
we argue that LLM use (under specific conditions) is analogous to a form of
senior authorship. On this view, the use of LLMs, even to generate complete
drafts of research papers, can be considered a legitimate form of authorship
according to the accepted criteria in many fields. We conclude that either such
use should be recognized as legitimate, or current criteria for authorship
require fundamental revision. AI use declaration: GPT-5 was used to help format

  The automatic construction of Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) is
essential for domain knowledge modeling by extracting meaningful
representations from learning materials. Despite growing interest, identifying
a scalable and reliable approach for automatic EduKG generation remains a
challenge. In an attempt to develop a unified and robust pipeline for automatic
EduKG construction, in this study we propose a pipeline for automatic EduKG
construction from PDF learning materials. The process begins with generating
slide-level EduKGs from individual pages/slides, which are then merged to form
a comprehensive EduKG representing the entire learning material. We evaluate
the accuracy of the EduKG generated from the proposed pipeline in our MOOC
platform, CourseMapper. The observed accuracy, while indicative of partial
success, is relatively low particularly in the educational context, where the
reliability of knowledge representations is critical for supporting meaningful
learning. To address this, we introduce targeted optimizations across multiple
pipeline components. The optimized pipeline achieves a 17.5% improvement in
accuracy and a tenfold increase in processing efficiency. Our approach offers a
holistic, scalable and end-to-end pipeline for automatic EduKG construction,
adaptable to diverse educational contexts, and supports improved semantic
representation of learning content.

Title: Inferring Prerequisite Knowledge Concepts in Educational Knowledge
  Graphs: A Multi-criteria Approach
Authors: Rawaa Alatrash and Mohamed Amine Chatti and Nasha Wibowo and Qurat Ul
  Ain
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
Comments: Accepted at IJCKG 2025
\\
  Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) organize various learning entities and
their relationships to support structured and adaptive learning. Prerequisite
relationships (PRs) are critical in EduKGs for defining the logical order in
which concepts should be learned. However, the current EduKG in the MOOC
platform CourseMapper lacks explicit PR links, and manually annotating them is
time-consuming and inconsistent. To address this, we propose an unsupervised
method for automatically inferring concept PRs without relying on labeled data.
We define ten criteria based on document-based, Wikipedia hyperlink-based,
graph-based, and text-based features, and combine them using a voting algorithm
to robustly capture PRs in educational content. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show that our approach achieves higher precision than existing methods
while maintaining scalability and adaptability, thus providing reliable support
for sequence-aware learning in CourseMapper.

  Automatic Phoneme Recognition (APR) systems are often trained using pseudo
phoneme-level annotations generated from text through Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P)
systems. These G2P systems frequently output multiple possible pronunciations
per word, but the standard Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss
cannot account for such ambiguity during training. In this work, we adapt Graph
Temporal Classification (GTC) to the APR setting. GTC enables training from a
graph of alternative phoneme sequences, allowing the model to consider multiple
pronunciations per word as valid supervision. Our experiments on English and
Dutch data sets show that incorporating multiple pronunciations per word into
the training loss consistently improves phoneme error rates compared to a
baseline trained with CTC. These results suggest that integrating pronunciation
variation into the loss function is a promising strategy for training APR
systems from noisy G2P-based supervision.

Title: Universality of physical neural networks with multivariate nonlinearity
Authors: Benjamin Savinson, David J. Norris, Siddhartha Mishra and Samuel
  Lanthaler
Categories: physics.optics cs.AI physics.class-ph physics.comp-ph
\\
  The enormous energy demand of artificial intelligence is driving the
development of alternative hardware for deep learning. Physical neural networks
try to exploit physical systems to perform machine learning more efficiently.
In particular, optical systems can calculate with light using negligible
energy. While their computational capabilities were long limited by the
linearity of optical materials, nonlinear computations have recently been
demonstrated through modified input encoding. Despite this breakthrough, our
inability to determine if physical neural networks can learn arbitrary
relationships between data -- a key requirement for deep learning known as
universality -- hinders further progress. Here we present a fundamental theorem
that establishes a universality condition for physical neural networks. It
provides a powerful mathematical criterion that imposes device constraints,
detailing how inputs should be encoded in the tunable parameters of the
physical system. Based on this result, we propose a scalable architecture using
free-space optics that is provably universal and achieves high accuracy on
image classification tasks. Further, by combining the theorem with temporal
multiplexing, we present a route to potentially huge effective system sizes in
highly practical but poorly scalable on-chip photonic devices. Our theorem and
scaling methods apply beyond optical systems and inform the design of a wide
class of universal, energy-efficient physical neural networks, justifying
further efforts in their development.

  This position paper argues that machine learning for scientific discovery
should shift from inductive pattern recognition to axiom-based reasoning. We
propose a game design framework in which scientific inquiry is recast as a
rule-evolving system: agents operate within environments governed by axioms and
modify them to explain outlier observations. Unlike conventional ML approaches
that operate within fixed assumptions, our method enables the discovery of new
theoretical structures through systematic rule adaptation. We demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach through preliminary experiments in logic-based
games, showing that agents can evolve axioms that solve previously unsolvable
problems. This framework offers a foundation for building machine learning
systems capable of creative, interpretable, and theory-driven discovery.

  State and Attention Pattern Analysis
Authors: Disha Makhija, Manoj Ghuhan Arivazhagan, Vinayshekhar Bannihatti
  Kumar, Rashmi Gangadharaiah
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Membership inference attacks (MIAs) reveal whether specific data was used to
train machine learning models, serving as important tools for privacy auditing
and compliance assessment. Recent studies have reported that MIAs perform only
marginally better than random guessing against large language models,
suggesting that modern pre-training approaches with massive datasets may be
free from privacy leakage risks. Our work offers a complementary perspective to
these findings by exploring how examining LLMs' internal representations,
rather than just their outputs, may provide additional insights into potential
membership inference signals. Our framework, \emph{memTrace}, follows what we
call \enquote{neural breadcrumbs} extracting informative signals from
transformer hidden states and attention patterns as they process candidate
sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representation dynamics, attention
distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns, we detect
potential memorization fingerprints that traditional loss-based approaches may
not capture. This approach yields strong membership detection across several
model families achieving average AUC scores of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks.
Our findings suggest that internal model behaviors can reveal aspects of
training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected,
highlighting the need for further research into membership privacy and the
development of more robust privacy-preserving training techniques for large
language models.

Title: Behind the Mask: Benchmarking Camouflaged Jailbreaks in Large Language
  Models
Authors: Youjia Zheng, Mohammad Zandsalimy, and Shanu Sushmita
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to a sophisticated
form of adversarial prompting known as camouflaged jailbreaking. This method
embeds malicious intent within seemingly benign language to evade existing
safety mechanisms. Unlike overt attacks, these subtle prompts exploit
contextual ambiguity and the flexible nature of language, posing significant
challenges to current defense systems. This paper investigates the construction
and impact of camouflaged jailbreak prompts, emphasizing their deceptive
characteristics and the limitations of traditional keyword-based detection
methods. We introduce a novel benchmark dataset, Camouflaged Jailbreak Prompts,
containing 500 curated examples (400 harmful and 100 benign prompts) designed
to rigorously stress-test LLM safety protocols. In addition, we propose a
multi-faceted evaluation framework that measures harmfulness across seven
dimensions: Safety Awareness, Technical Feasibility, Implementation Safeguards,
Harmful Potential, Educational Value, Content Quality, and Compliance Score.
Our findings reveal a stark contrast in LLM behavior: while models demonstrate
high safety and content quality with benign inputs, they exhibit a significant
decline in performance and safety when confronted with camouflaged jailbreak
attempts. This disparity underscores a pervasive vulnerability, highlighting
the urgent need for more nuanced and adaptive security strategies to ensure the
responsible and robust deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

Title: From Vision to Validation: A Theory- and Data-Driven Construction of a
  GCC-Specific AI Adoption Index
Authors: Mohammad Rashed Albous, Anwaar AlKandari, and Abdel Latef Anouze
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming public-sector processes
worldwide, yet standardized measures rarely address the unique drivers,
governance models, and cultural nuances of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries. This study employs a theory-driven foundation derived from an
in-depth analysis of literature review and six National AI Strategies (NASs),
coupled with a data-driven approach that utilizes a survey of 203 mid- and
senior-level government employees and advanced statistical techniques (K-Means
clustering, Principal Component Analysis, and Partial Least Squares Structural
Equation Modeling). By combining policy insights with empirical evidence, the
research develops and validates a novel AI Adoption Index specifically tailored
to the GCC public sector. Findings indicate that robust infrastructure and
clear policy mandates exert the strongest influence on successful AI
implementations, overshadowing organizational readiness in early adoption
stages. The combined model explains 70% of the variance in AI outcomes,
suggesting that resource-rich environments and top-down policy directives can
drive rapid but uneven technology uptake. By consolidating key dimensions
(Infrastructure & Resources, Organizational Readiness, and Policy & Regulatory
Environment) into a single composite index, this study provides a holistic yet
context-sensitive tool for benchmarking AI maturity. The index offers
actionable guidance for policymakers seeking to harmonize large-scale
deployments with ethical and regulatory standards. Beyond advancing academic
discourse, these insights inform more strategic allocation of resources,
cross-country cooperation, and capacity-building initiatives, thereby
supporting sustained AI-driven transformation in the GCC region and beyond.

  Autonomous regolith excavation is a cornerstone of in-situ resource
utilization for a sustained human presence beyond Earth. However, this task is
fundamentally hindered by the complex interaction dynamics of granular media
and the operational need for robots to use diverse tools. To address these
challenges, this work introduces a framework where a model-based reinforcement
learning agent learns within a parallelized simulation. This environment
leverages high-fidelity particle physics and procedural generation to create a
vast distribution of both lunar terrains and excavation tool geometries. To
master this diversity, the agent learns an adaptive interaction strategy by
dynamically modulating its own stiffness and damping at each control step
through operational space control. Our experiments demonstrate that training
with a procedural distribution of tools is critical for generalization and
enables the development of sophisticated tool-aware behavior. Furthermore, we
show that augmenting the agent with visual feedback significantly improves task
success. These results represent a validated methodology for developing the
robust and versatile autonomous systems required for the foundational tasks of
future space missions.

Title: PLanTS: Periodicity-aware Latent-state Representation Learning for
  Multivariate Time Series
Authors: Jia Wang, Xiao Wang, Chi Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Multivariate time series (MTS) are ubiquitous in domains such as healthcare,
climate science, and industrial monitoring, but their high dimensionality,
limited labeled data, and non-stationary nature pose significant challenges for
conventional machine learning methods. While recent self-supervised learning
(SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time
point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure
of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose
PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly
models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a
period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive
loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across
multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design
a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to
encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS
across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label
classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS
consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and
demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.

\\
  Deploying Mamba models on microcontrollers (MCUs) remains challenging due to
limited memory, the lack of native operator support, and the absence of
embedded-friendly toolchains. We present, to our knowledge, the first
deployment of a Mamba-based neural architecture on a resource-constrained MCU,
a fully C-based runtime-free inference engine: MambaLite-Micro. Our pipeline
maps a trained PyTorch Mamba model to on-device execution by (1) exporting
model weights into a lightweight format, and (2) implementing a handcrafted
Mamba layer and supporting operators in C with operator fusion and memory
layout optimization. MambaLite-Micro eliminates large intermediate tensors,
reducing 83.0% peak memory, while maintaining an average numerical error of
only 1.7x10-5 relative to the PyTorch Mamba implementation. When evaluated on
keyword spotting(KWS) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks,
MambaLite-Micro achieved 100% consistency with the PyTorch baselines, fully
preserving classification accuracy. We further validated portability by
deploying on both ESP32S3 and STM32H7 microcontrollers, demonstrating

  Autonomous microrobots in blood vessels could enable minimally invasive
therapies, but navigation is challenged by dense, moving obstacles. We propose
a real-time path planning framework that couples an analytic geometry global
planner (AGP) with two reactive local escape controllers, one based on rules
and one based on reinforcement learning, to handle sudden moving obstacles.
Using real-time imaging, the system estimates the positions of the microrobot,
obstacles, and targets and computes collision-free motions. In simulation, AGP
yields shorter paths and faster planning than weighted A* (WA*), particle swarm
optimization (PSO), and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), while maintaining
feasibility and determinism. We extend AGP from 2D to 3D without loss of speed.
In both simulations and experiments, the combined global planner and local
controllers reliably avoid moving obstacles and reach targets. The average
planning time is 40 ms per frame, compatible with 25 fps image acquisition and
real-time closed-loop control. These results advance autonomous microrobot
navigation and targeted drug delivery in vascular environments.

Title: Combining TSL and LLM to Automate REST API Testing: A Comparative Study

\\
  The effective execution of tests for REST APIs remains a considerable
challenge for development teams, driven by the inherent complexity of
distributed systems, the multitude of possible scenarios, and the limited time
available for test design. Exhaustive testing of all input combinations is
impractical, often resulting in undetected failures, high manual effort, and
limited test coverage. To address these issues, we introduce RestTSLLM, an
approach that uses Test Specification Language (TSL) in conjunction with Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test cases for REST APIs.
The approach targets two core challenges: the creation of test scenarios and
the definition of appropriate input data. The proposed solution integrates
prompt engineering techniques with an automated pipeline to evaluate various
LLMs on their ability to generate tests from OpenAPI specifications. The
evaluation focused on metrics such as success rate, test coverage, and mutation
score, enabling a systematic comparison of model performance. The results
indicate that the best-performing LLMs - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic),
Deepseek R1 (Deepseek), Qwen 2.5 32b (Alibaba), and Sabia 3 (Maritaca) -
consistently produced robust and contextually coherent REST API tests. Among
them, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed all other models across every metric,
emerging in this study as the most suitable model for this task. These findings
highlight the potential of LLMs to automate the generation of tests based on
API specifications.

\\
  We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based locomotion system for Cosmo, a
custom-built humanoid robot designed for entertainment applications. Unlike
traditional humanoids, entertainment robots present unique challenges due to
aesthetic-driven design choices. Cosmo embodies these with a disproportionately
large head (16% of total mass), limited sensing, and protective shells that
considerably restrict movement. To address these challenges, we apply
Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to enable the robot to learn natural-looking
movements while maintaining physical stability. We develop tailored domain
randomization techniques and specialized reward structures to ensure safe
sim-to-real, protecting valuable hardware components during deployment. Our
experiments demonstrate that AMP generates stable standing and walking
behaviors despite Cosmo's extreme mass distribution and movement constraints.
These results establish a promising direction for robots that balance aesthetic
appeal with functional performance, suggesting that learning-based methods can
effectively adapt to aesthetic-driven design constraints.

  Recovery Needs More than Textual Similarity

\\
  In the field of software traceability link recovery (TLR), textual similarity
has long been regarded as the core criterion. However, in tasks involving
natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on
textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted
a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing
the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific
auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models:
the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based
Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach
using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case
of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and
Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy
integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method
HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average
F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve
open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy
integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code
TLR task.

Title: Cross-Service Threat Intelligence in LLM Services using
  Privacy-Preserving Fingerprints
Authors: Waris Gill, Natalie Isak and Matthew Dressman
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  The widespread deployment of LLMs across enterprise services has created a
critical security blind spot. Organizations operate multiple LLM services
handling billions of queries daily, yet regulatory compliance boundaries
prevent these services from sharing threat intelligence about prompt injection
attacks, the top security risk for LLMs. When an attack is detected in one
service, the same threat may persist undetected in others for months, as
privacy regulations prohibit sharing user prompts across compliance boundaries.
  We present BinaryShield, the first privacy-preserving threat intelligence
system that enables secure sharing of attack fingerprints across compliance
boundaries. BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a unique
pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and
randomized response mechanism to potentially generate non-invertible
fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while providing privacy. Our
evaluations demonstrate that BinaryShield achieves an F1-score of 0.94,
significantly outperforming SimHash (0.77), the privacy-preserving baseline,
while achieving 64x storage reduction and 38x faster similarity search compared
to dense embeddings.

Title: Causal Debiasing Medical Multimodal Representation Learning with Missing
  Modalities
Authors: Xiaoguang Zhu, Lianlong Sun, Yang Liu, Pengyi Jiang, Uma Srivatsa,

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Submitted to IEEE TKDE
\\
  Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous
clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive
modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data
mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from
missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints.
Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available
observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically
neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself.
In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization:
missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality
availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that
influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we
perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose
a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based
multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a
missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on
backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly
disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our
method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness and causal insights.

Title: OptiProxy-NAS: Optimization Proxy based End-to-End Neural Architecture
  Search
Authors: Bo Lyu, Yu Cui, Tuo Shi, Ke Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hard computationally expensive
optimization problem with a discrete, vast, and spiky search space. One of the
key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via
certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent
predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture
search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the
NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In
particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be
continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable
optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed
architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$
search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural
language processing, and resource-constrained NAS fully demonstrate the
superior search results and efficiency. Further experiments on low-fidelity
scenarios verify the flexibility.

Title: GraMFedDHAR: Graph Based Multimodal Differentially Private Federated HAR
Authors: Labani Halder, Tanmay Sen, Sarbani Palit
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains
challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled
examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning
approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network
latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses
privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still
has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and
differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal
Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse
sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple
accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through
residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via
attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused
embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy
safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that
the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with
up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and
federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed
under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses
MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on
the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of
graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to
the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.

Title: SEASONED: Semantic-Enhanced Self-Counterfactual Explainable Detection of
  Adversarial Exploiter Contracts
Authors: Xng Ai, Shudan Lin, Zecheng Li, Kai Zhou, Bixin Li, Bin Xiao
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attacks have resulted in significant losses,
often orchestrated through Adversarial Exploiter Contracts (AECs) that exploit
vulnerabilities in victim smart contracts. To proactively identify such
threats, this paper targets the explainable detection of AECs.
  Existing detection methods struggle to capture semantic dependencies and lack
interpretability, limiting their effectiveness and leaving critical knowledge
gaps in AEC analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce SEASONED, an
effective, self-explanatory, and robust framework for AEC detection.
  SEASONED extracts semantic information from contract bytecode to construct a
semantic relation graph (SRG), and employs a self-counterfactual explainable
detector (SCFED) to classify SRGs and generate explanations that highlight the
core attack logic. SCFED further enhances robustness, generalizability, and
data efficiency by extracting representative information from these
explanations. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of SEASONED, which showcases outstanding detection
performance, robustness, generalizability, and data efficiency learning
ability. To support further research, we also release a new dataset of 359
AECs.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  How do we enable AI systems to efficiently learn in the real-world?
First-principles models are widely used to simulate natural systems, but often
fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions. In
contrast, deep learning approaches can estimate complex dynamics with minimal
assumptions but require large, representative datasets. We propose SimPEL, a
method that efficiently combines first-principles models with data-driven
learning by using low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning.
This enables SimPEL to benefit from simulator knowledge in low-data regimes and
leverage deep learning's flexibility when more data is available, all the while
carefully quantifying epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate SimPEL on diverse
systems, including biological, agricultural, and robotic domains, showing
superior performance in learning complex dynamics. For decision-making, we
demonstrate that SimPEL bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based
reinforcement learning. On a high-speed RC car task, SimPEL learns a highly
dynamic parking maneuver involving drifting with substantially less data than
state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the potential of SimPEL for
data-efficient learning and control in complex real-world environments.

Title: Offline vs. Online Learning in Model-based RL: Lessons for Data

\\
  Data collection is crucial for learning robust world models in model-based
reinforcement learning. The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect
trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or
training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning
task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for
effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on
world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been
thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both
paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different
environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline
counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of
offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This
issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,
offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between
the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We
demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online
interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of
online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that
incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of
offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data
when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on
expert data alone.

Title: Reasoning Introduces New Poisoning Attacks Yet Makes Them More
  Complicated

  Hayes, Robert Mullins, Yarin Gal
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Early research into data poisoning attacks against Large Language Models
(LLMs) demonstrated the ease with which backdoors could be injected. More
recent LLMs add step-by-step reasoning, expanding the attack surface to include
the intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) and its inherent trait of decomposing
problems into subproblems. Using these vectors for more stealthy poisoning, we
introduce ``decomposed reasoning poison'', in which the attacker modifies only
the reasoning path, leaving prompts and final answers clean, and splits the
trigger across multiple, individually harmless components.
  Fascinatingly, while it remains possible to inject these decomposed poisons,
reliably activating them to change final answers (rather than just the CoT) is
surprisingly difficult. This difficulty arises because the models can often
recover from backdoors that are activated within their thought processes.
Ultimately, it appears that an emergent form of backdoor robustness is
originating from the reasoning capabilities of these advanced LLMs, as well as
from the architectural separation between reasoning and final answer
generation.

Title: Tell-Tale Watermarks for Explanatory Reasoning in Synthetic Media
  Forensics
Authors: Ching-Chun Chang and Isao Echizen
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  The rise of synthetic media has blurred the boundary between reality and
fabrication under the evolving power of artificial intelligence, fueling an
infodemic that erodes public trust in cyberspace. For digital imagery, a
multitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis,
including semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that
recalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape
viewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control
perceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for
forensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing
deeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This
study seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation
chain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking
system is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of
transformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks
are tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner
that is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable. These
watermarks function as reference clues that evolve under the same
transformation dynamics as the carrier media, leaving interpretable traces when
subjected to transformations. Explanatory reasoning is then performed to infer
the most plausible account across the combinatorial parameter space of
composite transformations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the validity of
tell-tale watermarking with respect to fidelity, synchronicity and
traceability.

  LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user
queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across
domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical
component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines
tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and
correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been
largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks,
revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are
vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service
(DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate
external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also
propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic
systems.

  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the
robustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ
significantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable
predictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable
OOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of
these techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows
researchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to
identify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has
proven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the
performance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular
characteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable
evaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework
for robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the
reliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to
effectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for
their differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using
a conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based
on their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class
hierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy
to obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework.
This framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution
Detection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we
selected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without
outlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast
convergence to the true performance.

  Multiscale Simulations of High Power Microwave Breakdown

Categories: physics.plasm-ph cs.AI cs.LG physics.comp-ph
\\
  Modeling and simulation of High Power Microwave (HPM) breakdown, a multiscale
phenomenon, is computationally expensive and requires solving Maxwell's
equations (EM solver) coupled with a plasma continuity equation (plasma
solver). In this work, we present a hybrid modeling approach that combines the
accuracy of a differential equation-based plasma fluid solver with the
computational efficiency of FNO (Fourier Neural Operator) based EM solver.
Trained on data from an in-house FDTD-based plasma-fluid solver, the FNO
replaces computationally expensive EM field updates, while the plasma solver
governs the dynamic plasma response. The hybrid model is validated on microwave
streamer formation, due to diffusion ionization mechanism, in a 2D scenario for
unseen incident electric fields corresponding to entirely new plasma streamer
simulations not included in model training, showing excellent agreement with
FDTD based fluid simulations in terms of streamer shape, velocity, and temporal
evolution. This hybrid FNO based strategy delivers significant acceleration of
the order of 60X compared to traditional simulations for the specified problem
size and offers an efficient alternative for computationally demanding
multiscale and multiphysics simulations involved in HPM breakdown. Our work
also demonstrate how such hybrid pipelines can be used to seamlessly to
integrate existing C-based simulation codes with Python-based machine learning
frameworks for simulations of plasma science and engineering problems.

Title: time2time: Causal Intervention in Hidden States to Simulate Rare Events
  in Time Series Foundation Models
Authors: Debdeep Sanyal, Aaryan Nagpal, Dhruv Kumar, Murari Mandal, Saurabh

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine
patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as
market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be
leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To
investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal
intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments
of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period)
during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts:
injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm
semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we
find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent
vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks.
Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and
Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically
grounded representations are a robust property of large time series
transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that
governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution
to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for
strategic stress-testing.

Title: Decoding Latent Attack Surfaces in LLMs: Prompt Injection via HTML in
  Web Summarization
Authors: Ishaan Verma
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into web-based
systems for content summarization, yet their susceptibility to prompt injection
attacks remains a pressing concern. In this study, we explore how non-visible
HTML elements such as <meta>, aria-label, and alt attributes can be exploited
to embed adversarial instructions without altering the visible content of a
webpage. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 280 static web pages, evenly
divided between clean and adversarial injected versions, crafted using diverse
HTML-based strategies. These pages are processed through a browser automation
pipeline to extract both raw HTML and rendered text, closely mimicking
real-world LLM deployment scenarios. We evaluate two state-of-the-art
open-source models, Llama 4 Scout (Meta) and Gemma 9B IT (Google), on their
ability to summarize this content. Using both lexical (ROUGE-L) and semantic
(SBERT cosine similarity) metrics, along with manual annotations, we assess the
impact of these covert injections. Our findings reveal that over 29% of
injected samples led to noticeable changes in the Llama 4 Scout summaries,
while Gemma 9B IT showed a lower, yet non-trivial, success rate of 15%. These
results highlight a critical and largely overlooked vulnerability in LLM driven
web pipelines, where hidden adversarial content can subtly manipulate model
outputs. Our work offers a reproducible framework and benchmark for evaluating
HTML-based prompt injection and underscores the urgent need for robust
mitigation strategies in LLM applications involving web content.

  The rapid expansion of scientific literature makes it increasingly difficult

framework for sparse reference selection that emulates human knowledge

  Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is essential in probabilistic machine

this paper, we present a systematic framework for estimating both epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainty in probabilistic models. We focus on Gaussian Process
Latent Variable Models and employ scalable Random Fourier Features-based
Gaussian Processes to approximate predictive distributions efficiently. We

uncertainty estimation. Our results provide insights into the sources of
predictive uncertainty and illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in
quantifying the confidence in the predictions.

\\
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled growing interest
in automating geospatial analysis and GIS workflows, yet their actual
capabilities remain uncertain. In this work, we call for rigorous evaluation of
LLMs on well-defined geoprocessing tasks before making claims about full GIS
automation. To this end, we present GeoAnalystBench, a benchmark of 50
Python-based tasks derived from real-world geospatial problems and carefully
validated by GIS experts. Each task is paired with a minimum deliverable
product, and evaluation covers workflow validity, structural alignment,
semantic similarity, and code quality (CodeBLEU). Using this benchmark, we
assess both proprietary and open source models. Results reveal a clear gap:
proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o-mini achieve high validity 95% and
stronger code alignment (CodeBLEU 0.39), while smaller open source models like
DeepSeek-R1-7B often generate incomplete or inconsistent workflows (48.5%
validity, 0.272 CodeBLEU). Tasks requiring deeper spatial reasoning, such as
spatial relationship detection or optimal site selection, remain the most
challenging across all models. These findings demonstrate both the promise and
limitations of current LLMs in GIS automation and provide a reproducible
framework to advance GeoAI research with human-in-the-loop support.

Title: Multimodal Prompt Injection Attacks: Risks and Defenses for Modern LLMs
Authors: Andrew Yeo, Daeseon Choi
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption in recent years, with
industries increasingly relying on them to maintain a competitive advantage.
These models excel at interpreting user instructions and generating human-like
responses, leading to their integration across diverse domains, including
consulting and information retrieval. However, their widespread deployment also
introduces substantial security risks, most notably in the form of prompt
injection and jailbreak attacks.
  To systematically evaluate LLM vulnerabilities -- particularly to external
prompt injection -- we conducted a series of experiments on eight commercial
models. Each model was tested without supplementary sanitization, relying
solely on its built-in safeguards. The results exposed exploitable weaknesses
and emphasized the need for stronger security measures. Four categories of
attacks were examined: direct injection, indirect (external) injection,
image-based injection, and prompt leakage. Comparative analysis indicated that
Claude 3 demonstrated relatively greater robustness; nevertheless, empirical
findings confirm that additional defenses, such as input normalization, remain
necessary to achieve reliable protection.

  Quantum reinforcement learning has emerged as a framework combining quantum
computation with sequential decision-making, and applications to the
multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem have been reported. The graph bandit problem
extends the MAB setting by introducing spatial constraints, yet quantum
approaches remain limited. We propose a quantum algorithm for best-arm
identification in graph bandits, termed Quantum Spatial Best-Arm Identification
(QSBAI). The method employs quantum walks to encode superpositions over
graph-constrained actions, extending amplitude amplification and generalizing
the Quantum BAI algorithm via Szegedy's walk framework. This establishes a link
between Grover-type search and reinforcement learning tasks with structural
restrictions. We analyze complete and bipartite graphs, deriving the maximal
success probability of identifying the best arm and the time step at which it
is achieved. Our results highlight the potential of quantum walks to accelerate
exploration in constrained environments and extend the applicability of quantum
algorithms for decision-making.

Title: Meta-training of diffractive meta-neural networks for super-resolution
  direction of arrival estimation
Authors: Songtao Yang, Sheng Gao, Chu Wu, Zejia Zhao, Haiou Zhang, Xing Lin
Categories: physics.optics cs.AI physics.app-ph
Comments: 47 pages, 17 figures
\\
  Diffractive neural networks leverage the high-dimensional characteristics of
electromagnetic (EM) fields for high-throughput computing. However, the
existing architectures face challenges in integrating large-scale
multidimensional metasurfaces with precise network training and haven't
utilized multidimensional EM field coding scheme for super-resolution sensing.
Here, we propose diffractive meta-neural networks (DMNNs) for accurate EM field
modulation through metasurfaces, which enable multidimensional multiplexing and
coding for multi-task learning and high-throughput super-resolution direction
of arrival estimation. DMNN integrates pre-trained mini-metanets to
characterize the amplitude and phase responses of meta-atoms across different
polarizations and frequencies, with structure parameters inversely designed
using the gradient-based meta-training. For wide-field super-resolution angle
estimation, the system simultaneously resolves azimuthal and elevational angles
through x and y-polarization channels, while the interleaving of
frequency-multiplexed angular intervals generates spectral-encoded optical
super-oscillations to achieve full-angle high-resolution estimation.
Post-processing lightweight electronic neural networks further enhance the
performance. Experimental results validate that a three-layer DMNN operating at
27 GHz, 29 GHz, and 31 GHz achieves $\sim7\times$ Rayleigh diffraction-limited
angular resolution (0.5$^\circ$), a mean absolute error of 0.048$^\circ$ for
two incoherent targets within a $\pm 11.5^\circ$ field of view, and an angular
estimation throughput an order of magnitude higher (1917) than that of existing
methods. The proposed architecture advances high-dimensional photonic computing
systems by utilizing inherent high-parallelism and all-optical coding methods
for ultra-high-resolution, high-throughput applications.

Title: TSPC: A Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric Architecture for code-switching
  Vietnamese-English Speech Recognition
Authors: Minh N. H. Nguyen, Anh Nguyen Tran, Dung Truong Dinh, Nam Van Vo
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI cs.CL eess.AS
\\
  Code-switching (CS) presents a significant challenge for general Auto-Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle
phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly
difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct
phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition
are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for
Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC
employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme
set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling.
Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing
baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a
significantly lower word error rate of 20.8\% with reduced training resources.
Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme
adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS
Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios.

Title: Operationalising AI Regulatory Sandboxes under the EU AI Act: The Triple
  Challenge of Capacity, Coordination and Attractiveness to Providers
Authors: Deirdre Ahern
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  The EU AI Act provides a rulebook for all AI systems being put on the market
or into service in the European Union. This article investigates the
requirement under the AI Act that Member States establish national AI
regulatory sandboxes for testing and validation of innovative AI systems under
regulatory supervision to assist with fostering innovation and complying with
regulatory requirements. Against the backdrop of the EU objective that AI
regulatory sandboxes would both foster innovation and assist with compliance,
considerable challenges are identified for Member States around
capacity-building and design of regulatory sandboxes. While Member States are
early movers in laying the ground for national AI regulatory sandboxes, the
article contends that there is a risk that differing approaches being taken by
individual national sandboxes could jeopardise a uniform interpretation of the
AI Act and its application in practice. This could motivate innovators to play
sandbox arbitrage. The article therefore argues that the European Commission
and the AI Board need to act decisively in developing rules and guidance to
ensure a cohesive, coordinated approach in national AI regulatory sandboxes.
With sandbox participation being voluntary, the possibility that AI regulatory
sandboxes may prove unattractive to innovators on their compliance journey is
also explored. Confidentiality concerns, the inability to relax legal rules
during the sandbox, and the inability of sandboxes to deliver a presumption of
conformity with the AI Act are identified as pertinent concerns for innovators
contemplating applying to AI regulatory sandboxes as compared with other direct
compliance routes provided to them through application of harmonised standards
and conformity assessment procedures.

Title: Unified Interaction Foundational Model (UIFM) for Predicting Complex

\\
  A central goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems that can
understand and predict complex, evolving sequences of events. However, current
foundation models, designed for natural language, fail to grasp the holistic
nature of structured interactions found in domains like telecommunications,
e-commerce and finance. By serializing events into text, they disassemble them
into semantically fragmented parts, losing critical context. In this work, we
introduce the Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM), a foundation model
engineered for genuine behavioral understanding. At its core is the principle
of composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is treated as a
single, semantically coherent unit. This allows UIFM to learn the underlying
"grammar" of user behavior, perceiving entire interactions rather than a
disconnected stream of data points. We demonstrate that this architecture is
not just more accurate, but represents a fundamental step towards creating more
adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.

Title: DCMI: A Differential Calibration Membership Inference Attack Against
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Authors: Xinyu Gao, Xiangtao Meng, Yingkai Dong, Zheng Li, and Shanqing Guo
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively reduces hallucinations
by integrating external knowledge bases, it introduces vulnerabilities to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), particularly in systems handling sensitive
data. Existing MIAs targeting RAG's external databases often rely on model
responses but ignore the interference of non-member-retrieved documents on RAG
outputs, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose DCMI, a
differential calibration MIA that mitigates the negative impact of
non-member-retrieved documents. Specifically, DCMI leverages the sensitivity
gap between member and non-member retrieved documents under query perturbation.
It generates perturbed queries for calibration to isolate the contribution of
member-retrieved documents while minimizing the interference from
non-member-retrieved documents. Experiments under progressively relaxed
assumptions show that DCMI consistently outperforms baselines--for example,
achieving 97.42% AUC and 94.35% Accuracy against the RAG system with Flan-T5,
exceeding the MBA baseline by over 40%. Furthermore, on real-world RAG
platforms such as Dify and MaxKB, DCMI maintains a 10%-20% advantage over the
baseline. These results highlight significant privacy risks in RAG systems and
emphasize the need for stronger protection mechanisms. We appeal to the
community's consideration of deeper investigations, like ours, against the data
leakage risks in rapidly evolving RAG systems. Our code is available at

\\
  With the development of large-scale diffusion-based and
language-modeling-based generative models, impressive progress has been
achieved in text-to-audio generation. Despite producing high-quality outputs,
existing text-to-audio models mainly aim to generate semantically aligned sound
and fall short on precisely controlling fine-grained acoustic characteristics
of specific sounds. As a result, users that need specific sound content may
find it challenging to generate the desired audio clips. In this paper, we
present DreamAudio for customized text-to-audio generation (CTTA).
Specifically, we introduce a new framework that is designed to enable the model
to identify auditory information from user-provided reference concepts for
audio generation. Given a few reference audio samples containing personalized
audio events, our system can generate new audio samples that include these
specific events. In addition, two types of datasets are developed for training
and testing the customized systems. The experiments show that the proposed
model, DreamAudio, generates audio samples that are highly consistent with the
customized audio features and aligned well with the input text prompts.
Furthermore, DreamAudio offers comparable performance in general text-to-audio
tasks. We also provide a human-involved dataset containing audio events from
real-world CTTA cases as the benchmark for customized generation tasks.

Title: Empirical Study of Code Large Language Models for Binary Security Patch
  Detection
Authors: Qingyuan Li, Binchang Li, Cuiyun Gao, Shuzheng Gao, and Zongjie Li
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.CR
\\
  Security patch detection (SPD) is crucial for maintaining software security,
as unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to severe security risks. In recent
years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising
results on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied
to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a
significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with
binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive
performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and
binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their
potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a
significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code
understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this
gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf{19,448}
samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and
systematically evaluate \textbf{19} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate
their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that
directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security
patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques
fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla
models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning
strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two
levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs
achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the
pseudo-code representation.

Title: PolicyEvolve: Evolving Programmatic Policies by LLMs for multi-player
  games via Population-Based Training
Authors: Mingrui Lv, Hangzhi Liu, Zhi Luo, Hongjie Zhang, Jie Ou
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress
in solving complex multi-player games through self-play. However, training
effective adversarial policies requires millions of experience samples and
substantial computational resources. Moreover, these policies lack
interpretability, hindering their practical deployment. Recently, researchers
have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
programmatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based
policies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.
Inspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating
programmatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces
reliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies
with minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules:
Global Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool
preserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool
stores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently
high-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The
Policy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top
three policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the
current iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy
using feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited
into the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves
a sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it
is integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction
data from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes
directional improvements to guide the Policy Planner

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have
been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series
properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an
intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing
benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns,
restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there
is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost
expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream
applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing
relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for
recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we
construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a
comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct
an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the
relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our
experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we
propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing
interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the
first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series
data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation
system. The code is available at: https://github.com/blisky-li/ARIES.

Comments: Submitted to Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) Journal
\\
  Pre-trained models (PTMs) are machine learning models that have been trained
in advance, often on large-scale data, and can be reused for new tasks, thereby
reducing the need for costly training from scratch. Their widespread adoption
introduces a new class of software dependency, which we term Software
Dependencies 2.0, extending beyond conventional libraries to learned behaviors
embodied in trained models and their associated artifacts. The integration of
PTMs as software dependencies in real projects remains unclear, potentially
threatening maintainability and reliability of modern software systems that
increasingly rely on them. Objective: In this study, we investigate Software
Dependencies 2.0 in open-source software (OSS) projects by examining the reuse
of PTMs, with a focus on how developers manage and integrate these models.
Specifically, we seek to understand: (1) how OSS projects structure and
document their PTM dependencies; (2) what stages and organizational patterns
emerge in the reuse pipelines of PTMs within these projects; and (3) the
interactions among PTMs and other learned components across pipeline stages. We
conduct a mixed-methods analysis of a statistically significant random sample
of 401 GitHub repositories from the PeaTMOSS dataset (28,575 repositories
reusing PTMs from Hugging Face and PyTorch Hub). We quantitatively examine PTM
reuse by identifying patterns and qualitatively investigate how developers
integrate and manage these models in practice.

  Chemical and materials research has traditionally relied heavily on knowledge
narrative, with progress often driven by language-based descriptions of

limiting what conventional databases and ML can exploit. We present a
language-native database for boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS) polymer thermally
conductive composites that captures lightly structured information from papers

reasoning, with evidence-linked snippets. Records are organized in a
heterogeneous database and queried via composite retrieval with semantics, key
words and value filters. The system can synthesizes literature into accurate,

efficient Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool augmented agents to
interleave retrieval with reasoning and deliver actionable SOP. The framework

behavior, but its integration into the reinforcement learning (RL) framework
has been limited. This paper addresses key theoretical and algorithmic gaps for
precommitted agents with QH preferences. We make two primary contributions: (i)
we formally characterize the structure of the optimal policy, proving for the
first time that it reduces to a simple one-step non-stationary form; and (ii)
we design the first practical, model-free algorithms for both policy evaluation
and Q-learning in this setting, both with provable convergence guarantees. Our
results provide foundational insights for incorporating QH preferences in RL.

  The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep
learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough
understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic
segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on
surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level
contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive
Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple
levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level
Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream,
for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and
surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark
datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model
achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy
segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU
of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation,
respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class
SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for
anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing
streams for varying feature resolutions.

  The field of human activity recognition has evolved significantly, driven
largely by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) device technology,
particularly in personal devices. This study investigates the use of
ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for tracking inhabitant paths in home
environments using deep learning models. UWB technology estimates user
locations via time-of-flight and time-difference-of-arrival methods, which are
significantly affected by the presence of walls and obstacles in real
environments, reducing their precision. To address these challenges, we propose
a fingerprinting-based approach utilizing received signal strength indicator
(RSSI) data collected from inhabitants in two flats (60 m2 and 100 m2) while
performing daily activities. We compare the performance of convolutional neural
network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid CNN+LSTM models, as
well as the use of Bluetooth technology. Additionally, we evaluate the impact
of the type and duration of the temporal window (future, past, or a combination
of both). Our results demonstrate a mean absolute error close to 50 cm,
highlighting the superiority of the hybrid model in providing accurate location
estimates, thus facilitating its application in daily human activity
recognition in residential settings.

Title: Reasoning Language Model for Personalized Lung Cancer Screening
Authors: Chuang Niu and Ge Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Accurate risk assessment in lung cancer screening is critical for enabling
early cancer detection and minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures. The Lung
CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) has been widely used as the
standard framework for patient management and follow-up. Nevertheless,
Lung-RADS faces trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, as it
stratifies risk solely based on lung nodule characteristics without
incorporating various risk factors. Here we propose a reasoning language model
(RLM) to integrate radiology findings with longitudinal medical records for
individualized lung cancer risk assessment. Through a systematic study
including dataset construction and distillation, supervised fine-tuning,
reinforcement learning, and comprehensive evaluation, our model makes
significant improvements in risk prediction performance on datasets in the
national lung screening trial. Notably, RLM can decompose the risk evaluation
task into sub-components, analyze the contributions of diverse risk factors,
and synthesize them into a final risk score computed using our data-driven
system equation. Our approach improves both predictive accuracy and
monitorability through the chain of thought reasoning process, thereby
facilitating clinical translation into lung cancer screening.

  As artificial intelligence (AI) systems permeate critical sectors, the need
for professionals who can address ethical, legal and governance challenges has
become urgent. Current AI ethics education remains fragmented, often siloed by
discipline and disconnected from practice. This paper synthesizes literature
and regulatory developments to propose a modular, interdisciplinary curriculum
that integrates technical foundations with ethics, law and policy. We highlight
recurring operational failures in AI - bias, misspecified objectives,
generalization errors, misuse and governance breakdowns - and link them to
pedagogical strategies for teaching AI governance. Drawing on perspectives from
the EU, China and international frameworks, we outline a semester plan that
emphasizes integrated ethics, stakeholder engagement and experiential learning.
The curriculum aims to prepare students to diagnose risks, navigate regulation
and engage diverse stakeholders, fostering adaptive and ethically grounded
professionals for responsible AI governance.

Categories: cs.IR cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: Accepted at EMNLP MRL 2024
\\
  Language fairness in multilingual information retrieval (MLIR) systems is
crucial for ensuring equitable access to information across diverse languages.
This paper sheds light on the issue, based on the assumption that queries in
different languages, but with identical semantics, should yield equivalent
ranking lists when retrieving on the same multilingual documents. We evaluate
the degree of fairness using both traditional retrieval methods, and a DPR
neural ranker based on mBERT and XLM-R. Additionally, we introduce `LaKDA', a
novel loss designed to mitigate language biases in neural MLIR approaches. Our
analysis exposes intrinsic language biases in current MLIR technologies, with
notable disparities across the retrieval methods, and the effectiveness of
LaKDA in enhancing language fairness.

  Grasping of diverse objects in unstructured environments remains a
significant challenge. Open-loop grasping methods, effective in controlled
settings, struggle in cluttered environments. Grasp prediction errors and
object pose changes during grasping are the main causes of failure. In
contrast, closed-loop methods address these challenges in simplified settings
(e.g., single object on a table) on a limited set of objects, with no path to
generalization. We propose Grasp-MPC, a closed-loop 6-DoF vision-based grasping
policy designed for robust and reactive grasping of novel objects in cluttered
environments. Grasp-MPC incorporates a value function, trained on visual
observations from a large-scale synthetic dataset of 2 million grasp
trajectories that include successful and failed attempts. We deploy this
learned value function in an MPC framework in combination with other cost terms
that encourage collision avoidance and smooth execution. We evaluate Grasp-MPC
on FetchBench and real-world settings across diverse environments. Grasp-MPC
improves grasp success rates by up to 32.6% in simulation and 33.3% in
real-world noisy conditions, outperforming open-loop, diffusion policy,
transformer policy, and IQL approaches. Videos and more at

and must simultaneously infer the governing rule and learn the optimal policy
through experience. We evaluate our models across multiple rule-based and

  Roadmap
Authors: Ahmed E. Hassan, Hao Li, Dayi Lin, Bram Adams, Tse-Hsun Chen, Yutaro

Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
\\
  Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0) represents a new era where intelligent
agents are tasked not with simple code generation, but with achieving complex,
goal-oriented SE objectives. To harness these new capabilities while ensuring
trustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in
the Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE
for Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational
pillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest
differently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to
support this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command
center where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such
as Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The
Agent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform
tasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex
trade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated
human callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering
activities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating
the practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This
paper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision,
outlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper
culminates in a research roadmap that identifies a few key challenges and
opportunities while briefly discussing the resulting impact of this future on
SE education. Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a
conceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide
dialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric
tenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future.

Title: The Efficiency Frontier: Classical Shadows versus Quantum Footage
Authors: Shuowei Ma, Junyu Liu
Categories: quant-ph cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 23 pages, many figures
\\
  Interfacing quantum and classical processors is an important subroutine in
full-stack quantum algorithms. The so-called "classical shadow" method
efficiently extracts essential classical information from quantum states,
enabling the prediction of many properties of a quantum system from only a few
measurements. However, for a small number of highly non-local observables, or
when classical post-processing power is limited, the classical shadow method is
not always the most efficient choice. Here, we address this issue
quantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares
classical shadows with ``quantum footage," which refers to direct quantum
measurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of
download efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For
observables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical
shadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is
large and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large
Hermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when
the number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits
fall within a certain range. The key parameters influencing this behavior
include the number of qubits $n$, observables $M$, sparsity $k$, Pauli weight
$w$, accuracy requirement $\epsilon$, and failure tolerance $\delta$. We also
compare the resource consumption of the two methods on different types of
quantum computers and identify break-even points where the classical shadow
method becomes more efficient, which vary depending on the hardware. This paper
opens a new avenue for quantitatively designing optimal strategies for hybrid
quantum-classical tomography and provides practical insights for selecting the
most suitable quantum measurement approach in real-world applications.

Title: Beamforming-LLM: What, Where and When Did I Miss?
Authors: Vishal Choudhari
Categories: eess.AS cs.AI cs.CL cs.HC
\\
  We present Beamforming-LLM, a system that enables users to semantically
recall conversations they may have missed in multi-speaker environments. The
system combines spatial audio capture using a microphone array with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to support natural language queries such
as, "What did I miss when I was following the conversation on dogs?"
Directional audio streams are separated using beamforming, transcribed with
Whisper, and embedded into a vector database using sentence encoders. Upon
receiving a user query, semantically relevant segments are retrieved,
temporally aligned with non-attended segments, and summarized using a
lightweight large language model (GPT-4o-mini). The result is a user-friendly
interface that provides contrastive summaries, spatial context, and timestamped
audio playback. This work lays the foundation for intelligent auditory memory
systems and has broad applications in assistive technology, meeting
summarization, and context-aware personal spatial computing.

\\
  The accurate long-term forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
is still one of the biggest challenges in climate science. While it is true
that short-to medium-range performance has been improved significantly using
the advances in deep learning, statistical dynamical hybrids, most operational
systems still use the simple mean of all ensemble members, implicitly assuming
equal skill across members. In this study, we demonstrate, through a strictly
a-posteriori evaluation , for any large enough ensemble of ENSO forecasts,
there is a subset of members whose skill is substantially higher than that of
the ensemble mean. Using a state-of-the-art ENSO forecast system
cross-validated against the 1986-2017 observed Nino3.4 index, we identify two
Top-5 subsets one ranked on lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and another on
highest Pearson correlation. Generally across all leads, these outstanding
members show higher correlation and lower RMSE, with the advantage rising
enormously with lead time. Whereas at short leads (1 month) raises the mean
correlation by about +0.02 (+1.7%) and lowers the RMSE by around 0.14 {\deg}C
or by 23.3% compared to the All-40 mean, at extreme leads (23 months) the
correlation is raised by +0.43 (+172%) and RMSE by 0.18 {\deg}C or by 22.5%
decrease. The enhancements are largest during crucial ENSO transition periods
such as SON and DJF, when accurate amplitude and phase forecasting is of
greatest socio-economic benefit, and furthermore season-dependent e.g.,
mid-year months such as JJA and MJJ have incredibly large RMSE reductions. This
study provides a solid foundation for further investigations to identify
reliable clues for detecting high-quality ensemble members, thereby enhancing
forecasting skill.

  Timed regular expressions serve as a formalism for specifying real-time
behaviors of Cyber-Physical Systems. In this paper, we consider the synthesis
of timed regular expressions, focusing on generating a timed regular expression
consistent with a given set of system behaviors including positive and negative
examples, i.e., accepting all positive examples and rejecting all negative
examples. We first prove the decidability of the synthesis problem through an
exploration of simple timed regular expressions. Subsequently, we propose our
method of generating a consistent timed regular expression with minimal length,
which unfolds in two steps. The first step is to enumerate and prune candidate
parametric timed regular expressions. In the second step, we encode the
requirement that a candidate generated by the first step is consistent with the
given set into a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formula, which is
consequently solved to determine a solution to parametric time constraints.
Finally, we evaluate our approach on benchmarks, including randomly generated
behaviors from target timed models and a case study.

  Sixth generation (6G) systems require environment-aware communication, driven
by native artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC). Radio maps (RMs), providing spatially continuous channel information,
are key enablers. However, generating high-fidelity RM ground truth via
electromagnetic (EM) simulations is computationally intensive, motivating
machine learning (ML)-based RM construction. The effectiveness of these
data-driven methods depends on large-scale, high-quality training data. Current
public datasets often focus on single-input single-output (SISO) and limited
information, such as path loss, which is insufficient for advanced multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems requiring detailed channel state information (CSI).
To address this gap, this paper presents UrbanMIMOMap, a novel large-scale
urban MIMO CSI dataset generated using high-precision ray tracing. UrbanMIMOMap
offers comprehensive complex CSI matrices across a dense spatial grid, going
beyond traditional path loss data. This rich CSI is vital for constructing
high-fidelity RMs and serves as a fundamental resource for data-driven RM
generation, including deep learning. We demonstrate the dataset's utility
through baseline performance evaluations of representative ML methods for RM
construction. This work provides a crucial dataset and reference for research
in high-precision RM generation, MIMO spatial performance, and ML for 6G
environment awareness. The code and data for this work are available at:

Title: Statistical Inference for Misspecified Contextual Bandits
Authors: Yongyi Guo and Ziping Xu
Categories: math.ST cs.AI stat.TH
\\
  Contextual bandit algorithms have transformed modern experimentation by
enabling real-time adaptation for personalized treatment and efficient use of
data. Yet these advantages create challenges for statistical inference due to
adaptivity. A fundamental property that supports valid inference is policy
convergence, meaning that action-selection probabilities converge in
probability given the context. Convergence ensures replicability of adaptive
experiments and stability of online algorithms. In this paper, we highlight a
previously overlooked issue: widely used algorithms such as LinUCB may fail to
converge when the reward model is misspecified, and such non-convergence
creates fundamental obstacles for statistical inference. This issue is
practically important, as misspecified models -- such as linear approximations
of complex dynamic system -- are often employed in real-world adaptive
experiments to balance bias and variance.
  Motivated by this insight, we propose and analyze a broad class of algorithms
that are guaranteed to converge even under model misspecification. Building on
this guarantee, we develop a general inference framework based on an
inverse-probability-weighted Z-estimator (IPW-Z) and establish its asymptotic
normality with a consistent variance estimator. Simulation studies confirm that
the proposed method provides robust and data-efficient confidence intervals,
and can outperform existing approaches that exist only in the special case of
offline policy evaluation. Taken together, our results underscore the
importance of designing adaptive algorithms with built-in convergence
guarantees to enable stable experimentation and valid statistical inference in
practice.

  Traditional RL-based locomotion controllers often suffer from low data
efficiency, requiring extensive interaction to achieve robust performance. We
present a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework that improves
sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion by appending synthetic data to the
end of standard rollouts in PPO-based controllers, following the Dyna-Style
paradigm. A predictive model, trained alongside the policy, generates
short-horizon synthetic transitions that are gradually integrated using a
scheduling strategy based on the policy update iterations. Through an ablation
study, we identified a strong correlation between sample efficiency and rollout
length, which guided the design of our experiments. We validated our approach
in simulation on the Unitree Go1 robot and showed that replacing part of the
simulated steps with synthetic ones not only mimics extended rollouts but also
improves policy return and reduces variance. Finally, we demonstrate that this
improvement transfers to the ability to track a wide range of locomotion
commands using fewer simulated steps.

Categories: cs.CR cs.AI
\\
  As on-device LLMs(e.g., Apple on-device Intelligence) are widely adopted to
reduce network dependency, improve privacy, and enhance responsiveness,
verifying the legitimacy of models running on local devices becomes critical.
Existing attestation techniques are not suitable for billion-parameter Large
Language Models (LLMs), struggling to remain both time- and memory-efficient
while addressing emerging threats in the LLM era. In this paper, we present
AttestLLM, the first-of-its-kind attestation framework to protect the
hardware-level intellectual property (IP) of device vendors by ensuring that
only authorized LLMs can execute on target platforms. AttestLLM leverages an
algorithm/software/hardware co-design approach to embed robust watermarking
signatures onto the activation distributions of LLM building blocks. It also
optimizes the attestation protocol within the Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE), providing efficient verification without compromising inference
throughput. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations on LLMs from Llama, Qwen,
and Phi families for on-device use cases demonstrate AttestLLM's attestation
reliability, fidelity, and efficiency. Furthermore, AttestLLM enforces model
legitimacy and exhibits resilience against model replacement and forgery
attacks.

Title: A Fragile Number Sense: Probing the Elemental Limits of Numerical
  Reasoning in LLMs
Authors: Roussel Rahman and Aashwin Ananda Mishra
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent
capabilities, yet the robustness of their numerical reasoning remains an open
question. While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem
sets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In
this work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on
problems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial
puzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem
challenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced
operations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our
results show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three
categories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they
consistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a
heuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant
bottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents' proficiency is largely
confined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing
generative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is
more akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought,
limiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical
insights.

  Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling
large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs
introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per
token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers
are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely
and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance
and efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few
highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced
routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per
token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or
redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training,
plug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces
key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to
notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically
pruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering
faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained
MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that Ban&Pick delivers free performance gains and inference
acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on
Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from
65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the
vLLM.

Title: Beyond the Pre-Service Horizon: Infusing In-Service Behavior for
  Improved Financial Risk Forecasting

  Typical financial risk management involves distinct phases for pre-service
risk assessment and in-service default detection, often modeled separately.
This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation
(abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through
the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of
knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical
in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service
data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model
helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service
activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced,
including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the
representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This
approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also
enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from
the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of
pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to
mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on
large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios.

Title: MeanFlow-Accelerated Multimodal Video-to-Audio Synthesis via One-Step
  Generation
Authors: Xiaoran Yang, Jianxuan Yang, Xinyue Guo, Haoyu Wang, Ningning Pan,
  Gongping Huang
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI
\\
  A key challenge in synthesizing audios from silent videos is the inherent
trade-off between synthesis quality and inference efficiency in existing
methods. For instance, flow matching based models rely on modeling
instantaneous velocity, inherently require an iterative sampling process,
leading to slow inference speeds. To address this efficiency bottleneck, we
introduce a MeanFlow-accelerated model that characterizes flow fields using
average velocity, enabling one-step generation and thereby significantly
accelerating multimodal video-to-audio (VTA) synthesis while preserving audio
quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Furthermore, a
scalar rescaling mechanism is employed to balance conditional and unconditional
predictions when classifier-free guidance (CFG) is applied, effectively
mitigating CFG-induced distortions in one step generation. Since the audio
synthesis network is jointly trained with multimodal conditions, we further
evaluate it on text-to-audio (TTA) synthesis task. Experimental results
demonstrate that incorporating MeanFlow into the network significantly improves
inference speed without compromising perceptual quality on both VTA and TTA
synthesis tasks.

Title: CAPMix: Robust Time Series Anomaly Detection Based on Abnormal
  Assumptions with Dual-Space Mixup
Authors: Xudong Mou, Rui Wang, Tiejun Wang, Renyu Yang, Shiru Chen, Jie Sun,

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task,
particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal
dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate
the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training
discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer
from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly
knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and
Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too
closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting
classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable
anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a
CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted
manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision
strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly
shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional
network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and
ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated
training data. The code is available at https://github.com/alsike22/CAPMix.

  Computational models are critical to advance our understanding of how neural,
biomechanical, and physical systems interact to orchestrate animal behaviors.
Despite the availability of near-complete reconstructions of the Drosophila
melanogaster central nervous system, musculature, and exoskeleton, anatomically
and physically grounded models of fly leg muscles are still missing. These
models provide an indispensable bridge between motor neuron activity and joint
movements. Here, we introduce the first 3D, data-driven musculoskeletal model
of Drosophila legs, implemented in both OpenSim and MuJoCo simulation
environments. Our model incorporates a Hill-type muscle representation based on
high-resolution X-ray scans from multiple fixed specimens. We present a
pipeline for constructing muscle models using morphological imaging data and
for optimizing unknown muscle parameters specific to the fly. We then combine
our musculoskeletal models with detailed 3D pose estimation data from behaving
flies to achieve muscle-actuated behavioral replay in OpenSim. Simulations of
muscle activity across diverse walking and grooming behaviors predict
coordinated muscle synergies that can be tested experimentally. Furthermore, by
training imitation learning policies in MuJoCo, we test the effect of different
passive joint properties on learning speed and find that damping and stiffness
facilitate learning. Overall, our model enables the investigation of motor
control in an experimentally tractable model organism, providing insights into
how biomechanics contribute to generation of complex limb movements. Moreover,
our model can be used to control embodied artificial agents to generate
naturalistic and compliant locomotion in simulated environments.

  We analyze Decentralized Online Optimization algorithms using the Performance
Estimation Problem approach which allows, to automatically compute exact
worst-case performance of optimization algorithms. Our analysis shows that
several available performance guarantees are very conservative, sometimes by
multiple orders of magnitude, and can lead to misguided choices of algorithm.
Moreover, at least in terms of worst-case performance, some algorithms appear
not to benefit from inter-agent communications for a significant period of
time. We show how to improve classical methods by tuning their step-sizes, and
find that we can save up to 20% on their actual worst-case performance regret.

  AI-based recommender systems increasingly influence recruitment decisions.
Thus, transparency and responsible adoption in Human Resource Management (HRM)
are critical. This study examines how HR managers' AI literacy influences their
subjective perception and objective understanding of explainable AI (XAI)
elements in recruiting recommender dashboards. In an online experiment, 410
German-based HR managers compared baseline dashboards to versions enriched with
three XAI styles: important features, counterfactuals, and model criteria. Our
results show that the dashboards used in practice do not explain AI results and
even keep AI elements opaque. However, while adding XAI features improves
subjective perceptions of helpfulness and trust among users with moderate or
high AI literacy, it does not increase their objective understanding. It may
even reduce accurate understanding, especially with complex explanations. Only
overlays of important features significantly aided the interpretations of
high-literacy users. Our findings highlight that the benefits of XAI in
recruitment depend on users' AI literacy, emphasizing the need for tailored
explanation strategies and targeted literacy training in HRM to ensure fair,
transparent, and effective adoption of AI.

Title: DyC-STG: Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network for Real-time Data
  Credibility Analysis in IoT
Authors: Guanjie Cheng, Boyi Li, Peihan Wu, Feiyi Chen, Xinkui Zhao, Mengying
  Zhu, Shuiguang Deng
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast
spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet
unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal
graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short
in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1)
their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical,
event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations
with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To
address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network
(DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis
in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven
dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect
physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware
representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the
research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive
experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming
the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of
up to 0.930.

Title: QualityFM: a Multimodal Physiological Signal Foundation Model with
  Self-Distillation for Signal Quality Challenges in Critically Ill Patients

\\
  Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in
intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence
of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms
or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited
generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task
transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel
multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to
acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is
pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second
waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track
architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality,
leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality
signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To
efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local
quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism
within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function,
which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect
reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation
of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models
with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy
and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks:
false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial
fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and
ECG signals.

\\
  CAGE-2 is an accepted benchmark for learning and evaluating defender
strategies against cyberattacks. It reflects a scenario where a defender agent
protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods
for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a
formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender
strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy.
Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to
mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the
CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and
compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the
CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the
learned defender strategy and the required training time.

  Malware classification is a contemporary and ongoing challenge in
cyber-security: modern obfuscation techniques are able to evade traditional
static analysis, while dynamic analysis is too resource intensive to be
deployed at a large scale. One prominent line of research addresses these
limitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically
reshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These
images can then be classified based on their textural information using
computer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware
more effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D
images results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise,
caused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D
dependencies which do not exist in the original data. This loss of signal
limits the classification performance of the downstream model. This work
addresses these weaknesses by instead resizing the files into 1D signals which
avoids the need for heuristic reshaping, and additionally these signals do not
suffer from quantisation noise due to being stored in a floating-point format.
It is shown that existing 2D CNN architectures can be readily adapted to
classify these 1D signals for improved performance. Furthermore, a bespoke 1D
convolutional neural network, based on the ResNet architecture and
squeeze-and-excitation layers, was developed to classify these signals and
evaluated on the MalNet dataset. It was found to achieve state-of-the-art
performance on binary, type, and family level classification with F1 scores of
0.874, 0.503, and 0.507, respectively, paving the way for future models to
operate on the proposed signal modality.

  Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity.
While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance,
their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many
real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on
benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive
rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques
have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by
learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In
particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the
distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it
between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive
views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In
contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative
pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented
samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious
distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This
approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after
pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and
anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when
fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves
superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing
self-supervised models.

Title: Integrated Detection and Tracking Based on Radar Range-Doppler Feature
Authors: Chenyu Zhang, Yuanhang Wu, Xiaoxi Ma, Wei Yi
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI
\\
  Detection and tracking are the basic tasks of radar systems. Current joint
detection tracking methods, which focus on dynamically adjusting detection
thresholds from tracking results, still present challenges in fully utilizing
the potential of radar signals. These are mainly reflected in the limited
capacity of the constant false-alarm rate model to accurately represent
information, the insufficient depiction of complex scenes, and the limited
information acquired by the tracker. We introduce the Integrated Detection and
Tracking based on radar feature (InDT) method, which comprises a network
architecture for radar signal detection and a tracker that leverages detection
assistance. The InDT detector extracts feature information from each
Range-Doppler (RD) matrix and then returns the target position through the
feature enhancement module and the detection head. The InDT tracker adaptively
updates the measurement noise covariance of the Kalman filter based on
detection confidence. The similarity of target RD features is measured by
cosine distance, which enhances the data association process by combining
location and feature information. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method
was validated through testing on both simulated data and publicly available
datasets.

Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2507.04845
\\
  In this study, we address the multimodal task of stereo sound event
localization and detection with source distance estimation (3D SELD) in regular
video content. 3D SELD is a complex task that combines temporal event
classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning across spatial,
temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the most challenging to
model. Traditional SELD approaches typically rely on multichannel input,
limiting their capacity to benefit from large-scale pre-training due to data
constraints. To overcome this, we enhance a standard SELD architecture with
semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned
models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are
incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion,
which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. We perform an ablation study on
the development set of the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset to assess the
individual contributions of the language-aligned models and benchmark against
the DCASE Task 3 baseline systems. Additionally, we detail the curation process
of large synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets used for model pre-training.
These datasets were further expanded through left-right channel swapping
augmentation. Our approach, combining extensive pre-training, model ensembling,
and visual post-processing, achieved second rank in the DCASE 2025 Challenge
Task 3 (Track B), underscoring the effectiveness of our method. Future work
will explore the modality-specific contributions and architectural refinements.

  Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology
specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal
treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary,
typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon,
or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records
into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is
often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical
information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent
Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that
coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and
comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient
summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic
variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate
the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these
evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework
designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated
summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board
discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results
show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including
partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict
entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free
evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing
sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation
for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.

\\
  Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional
development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often
only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to
bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG
offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract
static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment
Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM
leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional
dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a
LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a
feature fusion module to integrate complementary information from multi-view
signals, and 3) a contrastive learning module to enhance class separation.
Validated on the CBCP dataset, BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
multiple metrics, demonstrating its potential for objective empathy assessment
and providing a preliminary insight into early interventions in children's
prosocial development.

work, we introduce AnalysisGNN, a novel graph neural network framework that
leverages a data-shuffling strategy with a custom weighted multi-task loss and
logit fusion between task-specific classifiers to integrate heterogeneously
annotated symbolic datasets for comprehensive score analysis. We further
integrate a Non-Chord-Tone prediction module, which identifies and excludes
passing and non-functional notes from all tasks, thereby improving the
consistency of label signals. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
AnalysisGNN achieves performance comparable to traditional static-dataset
approaches, while showing increased resilience to domain shifts and annotation
inconsistencies across multiple heterogeneous corpora.

Title: TrajAware: Graph Cross-Attention and Trajectory-Aware for Generalisable
  VANETs under Partial Observations
Authors: Xiaolu Fu, Ziyuan Bao, Eiman Kanjo
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables
\\
  Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a crucial component of intelligent
transportation systems; however, routing remains challenging due to dynamic
topologies, incomplete observations, and the limited resources of edge devices.
Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph
structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them
unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an
RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware
integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant
neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse
of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to
the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse
network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical
routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial
observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using
real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that
TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while
maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.

Title: Barycentric Neural Networks and Length-Weighted Persistent Entropy Loss:
  A Green Geometric and Topological Framework for Function Approximation
Authors: Victor Toscano-Duran, Rocio Gonzalez-Diaz and Miguel A.
  Guti\'errez-Naranjo
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  While it is well-established that artificial neural networks are
\emph{universal approximators} for continuous functions on compact domains,
many modern approaches rely on deep or overparameterized architectures that
incur high computational costs. In this paper, a new type of \emph{small
shallow} neural network, called the \emph{Barycentric Neural Network} ($\BNN$),
is proposed, which leverages a fixed set of \emph{base points} and their
\emph{barycentric coordinates} to define both its structure and its parameters.
We demonstrate that our $\BNN$ enables the exact representation of
\emph{continuous piecewise linear functions} ($\CPLF$s), ensuring strict
continuity across segments. Since any continuous function over a compact domain
can be approximated arbitrarily well by $\CPLF$s, the $\BNN$ naturally emerges
as a flexible and interpretable tool for \emph{function approximation}. Beyond
the use of this representation, the main contribution of the paper is the
introduction of a new variant of \emph{persistent entropy}, a topological
feature that is stable and scale invariant, called the \emph{length-weighted
persistent entropy} ($\LWPE$), which is weighted by the lifetime of topological
features. Our framework, which combines the $\BNN$ with a loss function based
on our $\LWPE$, aims to provide flexible and geometrically interpretable
approximations of nonlinear continuous functions in resource-constrained
settings, such as those with limited base points for $\BNN$ design and few
training epochs. Instead of optimizing internal weights, our approach directly
\emph{optimizes the base points that define the $\BNN$}. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves \emph{superior and faster approximation
performance} compared to classical loss functions such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and
log-cosh.

Title: Probabilistic Modeling of Latent Agentic Substructures in Deep Neural
  Networks
Authors: Su Hyeong Lee and Risi Kondor and Richard Ngo
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We develop a theory of intelligent agency grounded in probabilistic modeling
for neural models. Agents are represented as outcome distributions with
epistemic utility given by log score, and compositions are defined through
weighted logarithmic pooling that strictly improves every member's welfare. We
prove that strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or in binary
outcome spaces, but possible with three or more outcomes. Our framework admits
recursive structure via cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, while
tilt-based analysis rules out trivial duplication. Finally, we formalize an
agentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs using our theory: eliciting a benevolent
persona ("Luigi'") induces an antagonistic counterpart ("Waluigi"), while a
manifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields strictly larger first-order
misalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone. These results
clarify how developing a principled mathematical framework for how subagents
can coalesce into coherent higher-level entities provides novel implications
for alignment in agentic AI systems.

Title: Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks
Authors: Filippo Guerranti, Fabrizio Forte, Simon Geisler, Stephan G\"unnemann
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across
distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning.
Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a
principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing
wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial
approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range
propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which
decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local
aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range
interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization.
This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a
principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves
state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range
benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

Title: Aligning Large Vision-Language Models by Deep Reinforcement Learning and
  Direct Preference Optimization
Authors: Thanh Thi Nguyen, Campbell Wilson, Janis Dalins
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 8th International
  Conference on Algorithms, Computing and Artificial Intelligence (ACAI 2025)
\\
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or multimodal large language models
represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling
systems to understand and generate content across both visual and textual
modalities. While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress,
fine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific
tasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for
this aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using
reward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO
directly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an
explicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs,
highlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human
preferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive
multimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of
preference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as
scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.
The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to
the evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.

Title: Reinforcement learning meets bioprocess control through behaviour
  cloning: Real-world deployment in an industrial photobioreactor
Authors: Juan D. Gil, Ehecatl Antonio Del Rio Chanona, Jos\'e L. Guzm\'an,
  Manuel Berenguel
Categories: eess.SY cs.AI cs.LG cs.SY
\\
  The inherent complexity of living cells as production units creates major
challenges for maintaining stable and optimal bioprocess conditions, especially
in open Photobioreactors (PBRs) exposed to fluctuating environments. To address
this, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control approach, combined with
Behavior Cloning (BC), for pH regulation in open PBR systems. This represents,
to the best of our knowledge, the first application of an RL-based control
strategy to such a nonlinear and disturbance-prone bioprocess. Our method
begins with an offline training stage in which the RL agent learns from
trajectories generated by a nominal Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
controller, without direct interaction with the real system. This is followed
by a daily online fine-tuning phase, enabling adaptation to evolving process
dynamics and stronger rejection of fast, transient disturbances. This hybrid
offline-online strategy allows deployment of an adaptive control policy capable
of handling the inherent nonlinearities and external perturbations in open
PBRs. Simulation studies highlight the advantages of our method: the Integral
of Absolute Error (IAE) was reduced by 8% compared to PID control and by 5%
relative to standard off-policy RL. Moreover, control effort decreased
substantially-by 54% compared to PID and 7% compared to standard RL-an
important factor for minimizing operational costs. Finally, an 8-day
experimental validation under varying environmental conditions confirmed the
robustness and reliability of the proposed approach. Overall, this work
demonstrates the potential of RL-based methods for bioprocess control and paves
the way for their broader application to other nonlinear, disturbance-prone
systems.

Title: Disentangling Interaction and Bias Effects in Opinion Dynamics of Large
  Language Models
Authors: Vincent C. Brockers, David A. Ehrlich, Viola Priesemann
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.AI nlin.AO
\\
  Large Language Models are increasingly used to simulate human opinion
dynamics, yet the effect of genuine interaction is often obscured by systematic
biases. We present a Bayesian framework to disentangle and quantify three such
biases: (i) a topic bias toward prior opinions in the training data; (ii) an
agreement bias favoring agreement irrespective of the question; and (iii) an
anchoring bias toward the initiating agent's stance. Applying this framework to
multi-step dialogues reveals that opinion trajectories tend to quickly converge
to a shared attractor, with the influence of the interaction fading over time,
and the impact of biases differing between LLMs. In addition, we fine-tune an
LLM on different sets of strongly opinionated statements (incl. misinformation)
and demonstrate that the opinion attractor shifts correspondingly. Exposing
stark differences between LLMs and providing quantitative tools to compare them
to human subjects in the future, our approach highlights both chances and
pitfalls in using LLMs as proxies for human behavior.

Title: floq: Training Critics via Flow-Matching for Scaling Compute in
  Value-Based RL
Authors: Bhavya Agrawalla, Michal Nauman, Khush Agarwal, Aviral Kumar
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  A hallmark of modern large-scale machine learning techniques is the use of
training objectives that provide dense supervision to intermediate
computations, such as teacher forcing the next token in language models or
denoising step-by-step in diffusion models. This enables models to learn
complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we
investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD)
methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value
functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq
(flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function
using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching,
typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow
is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced
by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical
integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling
of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately
setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline
RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly
1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures,
highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.

Title: AxelSMOTE: An Agent-Based Oversampling Algorithm for Imbalanced
  Classification
Authors: Sukumar Kishanthan, Asela Hevapathige
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Class imbalance in machine learning poses a significant challenge, as skewed
datasets often hinder performance on minority classes. Traditional oversampling
techniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several
drawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls,
limit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To
overcome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based
approach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex
interactions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE
implements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve
correlations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for
meaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic
interpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.
Experiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms
state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Title: Tackling the Noisy Elephant in the Room: Label Noise-robust
  Out-of-Distribution Detection via Loss Correction and Low-rank Decomposition
Authors: Tarhib Al Azad and Shahana Ibrahim
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable component of
modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, especially in safety-critical
applications where models must identify inputs from unfamiliar classes not seen
during training. While OOD detection has been extensively studied in the
machine learning literature--with both post hoc and training-based
approaches--its effectiveness under noisy training labels remains
underexplored. Recent studies suggest that label noise can significantly
degrade OOD performance, yet principled solutions to this issue are lacking. In
this work, we demonstrate that directly combining existing label noise-robust
methods with OOD detection strategies is insufficient to address this critical
challenge. To overcome this, we propose a robust OOD detection framework that
integrates loss correction techniques from the noisy label learning literature
with low-rank and sparse decomposition methods from signal processing.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art OOD detection
techniques, particularly under severe noisy label settings.

  Insider threats are a growing organizational problem due to the complexity of
identifying their technical and behavioral elements. A large research body is
dedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological,
and educational perspectives. However, research in this domain has been
generally dependent on datasets that are static and limited access which
restricts the development of adaptive detection models. This study introduces a
novel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM)
Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which
contain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world
data distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs
were analyzed for insider threats by both Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with
their performance evaluated through statistical metrics including precision,
recall, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across
nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving
detection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in
synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection.

  Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches in cybersecurity exhibit
fundamental limitations: inadequate conceptual grounding leading to
non-robustness against novel attacks; limited instructibility impeding
analyst-guided adaptation; and misalignment with cybersecurity objectives.
Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI has emerged with the potential to revolutionize
cybersecurity AI. However, there is no systematic understanding of this
emerging approach. These hybrid systems address critical cybersecurity
challenges by combining neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning,
enabling enhanced threat understanding while introducing concerning autonomous
offensive capabilities that reshape threat landscapes. In this survey, we
systematically characterize this field by analyzing 127 publications spanning
2019-July 2025. We introduce a Grounding-Instructibility-Alignment (G-I-A)
framework to evaluate these systems, focusing on both cyber defense and cyber
offense across network security, malware analysis, and cyber operations. Our
analysis shows advantages of multi-agent NeSy architectures and identifies
critical implementation challenges including standardization gaps,
computational complexity, and human-AI collaboration requirements that
constrain deployment. We show that causal reasoning integration is the most
transformative advancement, enabling proactive defense beyond correlation-based
approaches. Our findings highlight dual-use implications where autonomous
systems demonstrate substantial capabilities in zero-day exploitation while
achieving significant cost reductions, altering threat dynamics. We provide
insights and future research directions, emphasizing the urgent need for
community-driven standardization frameworks and responsible development
practices that ensure advancement serves defensive cybersecurity objectives

Title: From Noise to Narrative: Tracing the Origins of Hallucinations in
  Transformers
Authors: Praneet Suresh, Jack Stanley, Sonia Joseph, Luca Scimeca, Danilo Bzdok
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science,
business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an
acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity
of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI
solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when
hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept
representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with
experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic
experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer
model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the
face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes
prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to
hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide
variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate
activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we
confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the
output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept
patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights
on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for
aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for
potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic
quantification of a model's hallucination risk.

  Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable
environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical
motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full
environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural
motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop
directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or
dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural
motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic
environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is
IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million
generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher
finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at
inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We
evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving
obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,
outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both
simulated and real-world settings. Video results and code available at

Title: Imagining Alternatives: Towards High-Resolution 3D Counterfactual
  Medical Image Generation via Language Guidance
Authors: Mohamed Mohamed, Brennan Nichyporuk, Douglas L. Arnold, and Tal Arbel
Categories: eess.IV cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating 2D images under various conditions; however the impressive
performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily
available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained
foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this
domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce
high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural
language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would
enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized
counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and
enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in
realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this
challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D
counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form
language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with
enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to
improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the
first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied
specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional
modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure.
Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework
successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating
high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically
generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven
disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.

Title: Outcome-based Exploration for LLM Reasoning
Authors: Yuda Song, Julia Kempe, Remi Munos
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL
Comments: 26 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,
which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields
substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation
diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is
critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL
post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce
effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our
study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,
where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and
(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a
limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose
outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final
outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,
which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch
exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time
diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models
demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity
collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based
exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these
contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning
without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

Title: Layer-Wise Anomaly Detection in Directed Energy Deposition using
  High-Fidelity Fringe Projection Profilometry
Authors: Guanzhong Hu, Wenpan Li, Rujing Zha, Ping Guo
Categories: physics.optics cs.CV
Comments: 26 pages, 15 figures
\\
  Directed energy deposition (DED), a metal additive manufacturing process, is
highly susceptible to process-induced defects such as geometric deviations,
lack of fusion, and poor surface finish. This work presents a
build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise
surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction
accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two
complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point
density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which
identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated,
annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from
reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly
linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise
anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process
control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for
micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures
and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.

Title: Feed Two Birds with One Scone: Exploiting Function-Space Regularization
  for Both OOD Robustness and ID Fine-Tuning Performance
Authors: Xiang Yuan, Jun Shu, Deyu meng, Zongben Xu
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

Title: A Synthetic-to-Real Dehazing Method based on Domain Unification
Authors: Zhiqiang Yuan, Jinchao Zhang, Jie Zhou
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: ICME 2025 Accept
\\
  Due to distribution shift, the performance of deep learning-based method for
image dehazing is adversely affected when applied to real-world hazy images. In
this paper, we find that such deviation in dehazing task between real and
synthetic domains may come from the imperfect collection of clean data. Owing
to the complexity of the scene and the effect of depth, the collected clean
data cannot strictly meet the ideal conditions, which makes the atmospheric
physics model in the real domain inconsistent with that in the synthetic
domain. For this reason, we come up with a synthetic-to-real dehazing method
based on domain unification, which attempts to unify the relationship between
the real and synthetic domain, thus to let the dehazing model more in line with
the actual situation. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively
demonstrate that the proposed dehazing method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.

  Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.

  Mars exploration requires precise and reliable terrain models to ensure safe
rover navigation across its unpredictable and often hazardous landscapes.
Stereoscopic vision serves a critical role in the rover's perception, allowing
scene reconstruction by generating precise depth maps through stereo matching.
State-of-the-art Martian planetary exploration uses traditional local
block-matching, aggregates cost over square windows, and refines disparities
via smoothness constraints. However, this method often struggles with
low-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns because it considers
only limited neighbouring pixels and lacks a wider understanding of scene
context. This paper uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based
refinement to mitigate the inherent block artefacts and recover lost details.
The approach balances the efficiency and accuracy of SGM and adds context-aware
segmentation to support more coherent depth inference. The proposed method has
been evaluated in three datasets with successful results: In a Mars analogue,
the terrain maps obtained show improved structural consistency, particularly in
sloped or occlusion-prone regions. Large gaps behind rocks, which are common in
raw disparity outputs, are reduced, and surface details like small rocks and
edges are captured more accurately. Another two datasets, evaluated to test the
method's general robustness and adaptability, show more precise disparity maps
and more consistent terrain models, better suited for the demands of autonomous
navigation on Mars, and competitive accuracy across both non-occluded and
full-image error metrics. This paper outlines the entire terrain modelling
process, from finding corresponding features to generating the final 2D
navigation maps, offering a complete pipeline suitable for integration in
future planetary exploration missions.

  Healthcare Industries: Fast R-CNN, U-Net, Transfer Learning-Based CNN, and
  Fully Connected CNN
Authors: Mohsen Asghari Ilani and Yaser M. Banad
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered deep learning has advanced brain tumor
diagnosis in Internet of Things (IoT)-healthcare systems, achieving high
accuracy with large datasets. Brain health is critical to human life, and
accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) provides key data for brain tumor detection, serving as a major
source of big data for AI-driven image classification. In this study, we
classified glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from MRI images using
Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and UNet architectures. We
also applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and CNN-based transfer
learning models such as Inception-V3, EfficientNetB4, and VGG19. Model
performance was assessed using F-score, recall, precision, and accuracy. The
Fast R-CNN achieved the best results with 99% accuracy, 98.5% F-score, 99.5%
Area Under the Curve (AUC), 99.4% recall, and 98.5% precision. Combining R-CNN,
UNet, and transfer learning enables earlier diagnosis and more effective
treatment in IoT-healthcare systems, improving patient outcomes. IoT devices
such as wearable monitors and smart imaging systems continuously collect
real-time data, which AI algorithms analyze to provide immediate insights for
timely interventions and personalized care. For external cohort cross-dataset
validation, EfficientNetB2 achieved the strongest performance among fine-tuned
EfficientNet models, with 92.11% precision, 92.11% recall/sensitivity, 95.96%
specificity, 92.02% F1-score, and 92.23% accuracy. These findings underscore
the robustness and reliability of AI models in handling diverse datasets,
reinforcing their potential to enhance brain tumor classification and patient

Title: Performance of Conformal Prediction in Capturing Aleatoric Uncertainty
Authors: Misgina Tsighe Hagos, Claes Lundstr\"om
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction
sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction
set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of
evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction
set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are
larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of
this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how
effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically
the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform
this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number
of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess
the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use
three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight
deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations
from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per
instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast
majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak
correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate
correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing
the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can
provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing
aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.

Title: eKalibr-Inertial: Continuous-Time Spatiotemporal Calibration for
  Event-Based Visual-Inertial Systems
Authors: Shuolong Chen, Xingxing Li, and Liu Yuan
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively
studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object
detection. In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly
adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale
perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion,
accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In
this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator
for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid
board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in
eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and
efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be
accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization
is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The
results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can
achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The
implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at
(https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community.

\\
  Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object
shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In
this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset
from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy
can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot
to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed
during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the
object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the
number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several
real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer,
and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by
investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we
show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for
data augmentation.

Title: O$^3$Afford: One-Shot 3D Object-to-Object Affordance Grounding for
  Generalizable Robotic Manipulation
Authors: Tongxuan Tian, Xuhui Kang, Yen-Ling Kuo
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
Comments: Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) 2025. Project website:
  https://o3afford.github.io/
\\
  Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it
establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting
objects. However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object
affordance, overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve
relationships between pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge
of object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints.
Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundation
models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning
approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation
models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding
enable our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel
objects and categories. We further integrate our 3D affordance representation
with large language models (LLMs) for robotics manipulation, significantly
enhancing LLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about object interactions
when generating task-specific constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D
object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation demonstrate that
our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both
accuracy and generalization capability.

Title: Evaluating the Efficiency of Latent Spaces via the Coupling-Matrix
Authors: Mehmet Can Yavuz, Berrin Yanikoglu
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent
embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks
often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode
overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering
generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss
provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a
failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly
quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices
derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics
against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,
interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.
We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST
variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple
architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low
rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction
error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.
Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower
bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)
can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware
regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across
models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool
for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

\\
  The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the
generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often
overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive
and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we
introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,
backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model
generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural
adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time
device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data
distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The
prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,
facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer
knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter
changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and
recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and
generality.

\\
  Objectives: Federated learning (FL) may mitigate privacy constraints,
heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI.
We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth
segmentation in panoramic radiographs across multiple data corruption
scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six
institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label
manipulation (dilated/missing annotations); image-quality manipulation
(additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted
data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and
validation-loss trajectories were monitored for anomaly detection and a set of
metrics (Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD) was evaluated on a hold-out test set.
From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. CL and LL served as comparators. Results: Baseline: FL
achieved a median Dice of 0.94889 (ASSD: 1.33229), slightly better than CL at
0.94706 (ASSD: 1.37074) and LL at 0.93557-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.69777).
Label manipulation: FL maintained the best median Dice score at 0.94884 (ASSD:
1.46487) versus CL's 0.94183 (ASSD: 1.75738) and LL's 0.93003-0.94026 (ASSD:
1.51910-2.11462). Image noise: FL led with Dice at 0.94853 (ASSD: 1.31088); CL
scored 0.94787 (ASSD: 1.36131); LL ranged from 0.93179-0.94026 (ASSD:
1.51910-1.77350). Faulty-client exclusion: FL reached Dice at 0.94790 (ASSD:
1.33113) better than CL's 0.94550 (ASSD: 1.39318). Loss-curve monitoring
reliably flagged the corrupted site. Conclusions: FL matches or exceeds CL and
outperforms LL across corruption scenarios while preserving privacy. Per-client
loss trajectories provide an effective anomaly-detection mechanism and support
FL as a practical, privacy-preserving approach for scalable clinical AI
deployment.

  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an invaluable tool for clinical and

cause inconsistencies in image contrast, hindering data comparability and
reproducibility across datasets and clinical studies. Existing scanner
harmonization methods, designed to address this challenge, face limitations,
such as requiring traveling subjects or struggling to generalize to unseen
domains. We propose a novel approach using a conditioned diffusion autoencoder
with a contrastive loss and domain-agnostic contrast augmentation to harmonize
MR images across scanners while preserving subject-specific anatomy. Our method
enables brain MRI synthesis from a single reference image. It outperforms
baseline techniques, achieving a +7% PSNR improvement on a traveling subjects
dataset and +18% improvement on age regression in unseen. Our model provides
robust, effective harmonization of brain MRIs to target scanners without
requiring fine-tuning. This advancement promises to enhance comparability,
reproducibility, and generalizability in multi-site and longitudinal clinical
studies, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.

\\
  Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from
images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters
of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have
simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint
locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their
potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating
biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion
capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a
parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure
that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL
body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data
of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons
inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL
mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we
re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting
SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and
biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more
biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside
the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes
we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include
biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in
the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better
constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code,
and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..

  In environments where visual sensors falter, in-air sonar provides a reliable
alternative for autonomous systems. While previous research has successfully
classified individual acoustic landmarks, this paper takes a step towards
increasing information capacity by introducing reflector constellations as

reflectors from a single in-air 3D sonar measurement. Our initial findings on a
small dataset confirm the feasibility of this approach, validating the ability
to decode these complex acoustic patterns. Secondly, we investigated using
adaptive beamforming with null-steering to isolate individual reflectors for
single-label classification. Finally, we discuss the experimental results and
limitations, offering key insights and future directions for developing
acoustic landmark systems with significantly increased information entropy and
their accurate and robust detection and classification.

\\
  Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in
medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their
design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their
effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical
fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in
this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with
missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these
gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the
pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our
approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation
models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing
modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to
learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage
semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both
the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype
classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing
state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a
scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging
powerful vision foundation models pre-trained on natural images while
addressing real-world clinical challenges such as missing data and limited

Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has
inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic
manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from
autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in
text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a
series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for
robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present
LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon
pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to
robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token

special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a
hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences
hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.

Title: Scaling Transformer-Based Novel View Synthesis Models with Token
  Disentanglement and Synthetic Data

\\
  Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in
generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating
novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these
models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene
datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To
overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion
models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic
data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data
generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address
this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer
architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective
learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over
standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.
As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and
cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Project page:

Title: F1: A Vision-Language-Action Model Bridging Understanding and Generation
  to Actions

  Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a
central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to
short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,
we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual
foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a
Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,
foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,
and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to
synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By
forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation
as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that
implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable
capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset
comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training
scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual
foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive
evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1
consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in
both task success rate and generalization ability.

Title: Efficient Fault Localization in a Cloud Stack Using End-to-End
  Application Service Topology
Authors: Dhanya R Mathews, Mudit Verma, Pooja Aggarwal, J.Lakshmi
Categories: cs.PF cs.DC
\\
  Cloud application services are distributed in nature and have components
across the stack working together to deliver the experience to end users. The
wide adoption of microservice architecture exacerbates failure management due
to increased service components. To be effective, the strategies to enhance the
application service resilience need to be autonomous and developed at the
service's granularity, considering its end-to-end components. However, the
massive amount of observability data generated by all these components across
the service stack poses a significant challenge in reacting to anomalies and
restoring the service quality in real time. Identifying the most informative
observability data from across the cloud service stack and timely localization
of root causes of anomalies thus becomes crucial to ensure service resilience.
This article presents a novel approach that considers the application service
topology to select the most informative metrics across the cloud stack to
support efficient, explainable, and accurate root cause identifications in case
of performance anomalies. The usefulness of the selected metrics is then
evaluated using the state-of-the-art Root Cause Detection (RCD) algorithm for
localizing the root cause of performance anomalies. As a step towards improving
the accuracy and efficiency of RCD, this article then proposes the
Topology-Aware-RCD (TA-RCD) that incorporates the end-to-end application
service topology in RCD. The evaluation of the failure injection studies shows
that the proposed approach performs at least 2X times better on average than
the state-of-the-art RCD algorithm regarding Top-3 and Top-5 recall.

\\
  The demand for high-fidelity numerical simulations in soil-structure
interaction analysis is on the rise, yet a standardized workflow to guide the
creation of such simulations remains elusive. This paper aims to bridge this
gap by presenting a step-by-step guideline proposing a workflow for dynamic
analysis of structures with pile foundations. The proposed workflow encompasses
instructions on how to use Domain Reduction Method for loading, Perfectly
Matched Layer elements for wave absorption, soil-structure interaction modeling
using Embedded interface elements, and domain decomposition for efficient use
of processing units. Through a series of numerical simulations, we showcase the
practical application of this workflow. Our results reveal the efficacy of the
Domain Reduction Method in reducing simulation size without compromising model
fidelity, show the precision of Perfectly Matched Layer elements in modeling
infinite domains, highlight the efficiency of Embedded Interface elements in
establishing connections between structures and the soil domain, and
demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the proposed workflow in conducting
high-fidelity simulations. While our study focuses on simplified geometries and
loading scenarios, it serves as a foundational framework for future research
endeavors aimed at exploring more intricate structural configurations and
dynamic loading conditions

Title: Distributed Deep Learning using Stochastic Gradient Staleness
Authors: Viet Hoang Pham and Hyo-Sung Ahn
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC
\\
  Despite the notable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving complex
tasks, the training process still remains considerable challenges. A primary
obstacle is the substantial time required for training, particularly as high
performing DNNs tend to become increasingly deep (characterized by a larger
number of hidden layers) and require extensive training datasets. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a distributed training method that
integrates two prominent strategies for accelerating deep learning: data
parallelism and fully decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm. By
utilizing multiple computational units operating in parallel, the proposed
approach enhances the amount of training data processed in each iteration while
mitigating locking issues commonly associated with the backpropagation
algorithm. These features collectively contribute to significant improvements
in training efficiency. The proposed distributed training method is rigorously
proven to converge to critical points under certain conditions. Its
effectiveness is further demonstrated through empirical evaluations, wherein an
DNN is trained to perform classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Title: Tiga: Accelerating Geo-Distributed Transactions with Synchronized Clocks
  [Technical Report]

Categories: cs.NI cs.DB cs.DC
Comments: This is the technical report for our paper accepted by The 31st

DOI: 10.1145/3731569.3764854
\\
  This paper presents Tiga, a new design for geo-replicated and scalable
transactional databases such as Google Spanner. Tiga aims to commit
transactions within 1 wide-area roundtrip time, or 1 WRTT, for a wide range of
scenarios, while maintaining high throughput with minimal computational
overhead. Tiga consolidates concurrency control and consensus, completing both
strictly serializable execution and consistent replication in a single round.
It uses synchronized clocks to proactively order transactions by assigning each
a future timestamp at submission. In most cases, transactions arrive at servers
before their future timestamps and are serialized according to the designated
timestamp, requiring 1 WRTT to commit. In rare cases, transactions are delayed
and proactive ordering fails, in which case Tiga falls back to a slow path,
committing in 1.5--2 WRTTs. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, Tiga can
commit more transactions at 1-WRTT latency, and incurs much less throughput
overhead. Evaluation results show that Tiga outperforms all baselines,
achieving 1.3--7.2$\times$ higher throughput and 1.4--4.6$\times$ lower
latency. Tiga is open-sourced at

Title: Introduction to Number Theoretic Transform
Authors: Banhirup Sengupta, Peenal Gupta, and Souvik Sengupta
Categories: cs.CR cs.DC
\\
  The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) can be regarded as a variant of the
Discrete Fourier Transform. NTT has been quite a powerful mathematical tool in
developing Post-Quantum Cryptography and Homomorphic Encryption. The Fourier
Transform essentially decomposes a signal into its frequencies. They are
traditionally sine or cosine waves. NTT works more over groups or finite fields
rather than on a continuous signal and polynomials work as the analog of sine
waves in case of NTT. Fast Fourier Trnasform (FFT) style NTT or fast NTT has
been proven to be useful in lattice-based cryptography due to its ability to
reduce the complexity of polynomial multiplication from quadratic to
quasilinear. We have introduced the concepts of cyclic, negacyclic convolutions
along with NTT and its inverse and their fast versions.

  Modern vehicles accumulate fragmented lifecycle records across OEMs, owners,
and service centers that are difficult to verify and prone to fraud. We propose
VehiclePassport, a GAIA-X-aligned digital passport anchored on blockchain with
zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving verification.
VehiclePassport immutably commits to manufacturing, telemetry, and service
events while enabling selective disclosure via short-lived JWTs and Groth16
proofs. Our open-source reference stack anchors hashes on Polygon zkEVM at
<$0.02 per event, validates proofs in <10 ms, and scales to millions of
vehicles. This architecture eliminates paper-based KYC, ensures GDPR-compliant
traceability, and establishes a trustless foundation for insurance, resale, and
regulatory applications in global mobility data markets.

Title: Social Dynamics of DAOs: Power, Onboarding, and Inclusivity
Authors: Victoria Kozlova, Ben Biedermann
Categories: cs.CY cs.DC
ACM-class: C.2.4; C.2.1; D.4.6; K.4.3
\\
  This report explores the often-overlooked cultural and social dynamics
shaping participation and power in DAOs. Drawing on qualitative interviews and
ethnographic observations, it shows how factors such as financial privilege,
informal gatekeeping, visibility bias, and onboarding structures create
barriers to meaningful inclusion. While DAOs are frequently framed as
permissionless and egalitarian, the lived experiences of contributors reveal a
more complex reality, one in which soft power and implicit norms determine
people's position within DAOs. Instead of offering solutionist prescriptions,
this report argues for a deeper cultural reflection within the DAO ecosystem.
It highlights that decentralisation is not solely a protocol-level feature, but
an ongoing social process that requires intentional cultivation of trust,
belonging, and epistemic plurality. With this report, we want to sharpen the
collective awareness of structural blind spots and call for building more
inclusive and culturally conscious decentralised systems.

Title: Distributed Automatic Generation Control subject to Ramp-Rate-Limits:
  Anytime Feasibility and Uniform Network-Connectivity
Authors: Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Hamid R. Rabiee
Categories: eess.SY cs.DC cs.SY eess.SP math.OC
Comments: Digital Signal Processing journal
\\
  This paper considers automatic generation control over an information-sharing
network of communicating generators as a multi-agent system. The optimization
solution is distributed among the agents based on information consensus
algorithms, while addressing the generators' ramp-rate-limits (RRL). This is
typically ignored in the existing linear/nonlinear optimization solutions but
they exist in real-time power generation scenarios. Without addressing the RRL,
the generators cannot follow the assigned rate of generating power by the
optimization algorithm; therefore, the existing solutions may not necessarily
converge to the exact optimal cost or may lose feasibility in practice. The
proposed solution in this work addresses the ramp-rate-limit constraint along
with the box constraint (limits on the generated powers) and the
coupling-constraint (generation-demand balance) at all iteration times of the
algorithm. The latter is referred to as the anytime feasibility and implies
that at every termination point of the algorithm, the balance between the
demand and generated power holds. To improve the convergence rate of the
algorithm we further consider internal signum-based nonlinearity. We also show
that our solution can tolerate communication link removal. This follows from
the uniform-connectivity assumption on the communication network.

Title: Human-LLM Synergy in Context-Aware Adaptive Architecture for Scalable
  Drone Swarm Operation
Authors: Ahmed R. Sadik, Muhammad Ashfaq, Niko M\"akitalo, Tommi Mikkonen
Categories: cs.RO cs.MA
\\
  The deployment of autonomous drone swarms in disaster response missions
necessitates the development of flexible, scalable, and robust coordination
systems. Traditional fixed architectures struggle to cope with dynamic and
unpredictable environments, leading to inefficiencies in energy consumption and
connectivity. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an adaptive
architecture for drone swarms, leveraging a Large Language Model to dynamically
select the optimal architecture as centralized, hierarchical, or holonic based
on real time mission parameters such as task complexity, swarm size, and
communication stability. Our system addresses the challenges of scalability,
adaptability, and robustness,ensuring efficient energy consumption and
maintaining connectivity under varying conditions. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that our adaptive architecture outperforms traditional static
models in terms of scalability, energy efficiency, and connectivity. These
results highlight the potential of our approach to provide a scalable,
adaptable, and resilient solution for real world disaster response scenarios.

Title: Hierarchical Decision-Making in Population Games
Authors: Yu-Wen Chen, Nuno C. Martins, Murat Arcak
Categories: eess.SY cs.MA cs.SY
\\
  This paper introduces a hierarchical framework for population games, where
individuals delegate decision-making to proxies that act within their own
strategic interests. This framework extends classical population games, where
individuals are assumed to make decisions directly, to capture various
real-world scenarios involving multiple decision layers. We establish
equilibrium properties and provide convergence results for the proposed
hierarchical structure. Additionally, based on these results, we develop a
systematic approach to analyze population games with general convex
constraints, without requiring individuals to have full knowledge of the
constraints as in existing methods. We present a navigation application with
capacity constraints as a case study.

Title: Code2MCP: A Multi-Agent Framework for Automated Transformation of Code
  Repositories into Model Context Protocol Services
Authors: Chaoqian Ouyang, Ling Yue, Shimin Di, Libin Zheng, Shaowu Pan,
  Min-Ling Zhang
Categories: cs.SE cs.LG cs.MA
\\
  The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a significant
integration challenge in the AI agent ecosystem, often called the "$N \times M$
problem," where N models require custom integrations for M tools. This
fragmentation stifles innovation and creates substantial development overhead.
While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to resolve
this, its adoption is hindered by the manual effort required to convert the
vast universe of existing software into MCP-compliant services. This is
especially true for the millions of open-source repositories on GitHub, the
world's largest collection of functional code. This paper introduces Code2MCP,
a highly automated, agentic framework designed to transform any GitHub
repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Our
system employs a multi-stage workflow that automates the entire process, from
code analysis and environment configuration to service generation and
deployment. A key innovation of our framework is an LLM-driven, closed-loop
"Run--Review--Fix" cycle, which enables the system to autonomously debug and
repair the code it generates. Code2MCP produces not only deployable services
but also comprehensive technical documentation, acting as a catalyst to
accelerate the MCP ecosystem by systematically unlocking the world's largest
open-source code repository and automating the critical last mile of tool
integration. The code is open-sourced at
